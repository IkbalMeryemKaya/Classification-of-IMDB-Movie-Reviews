"Truth be told, The Matrix is a film I've watched many times when I was a kid. Sixth, seventh grade, this trilogy was, along some other films, what I'm going to call ""Shilo-Core"", meaning, films I've been obsessed with before diving deep into cinema. I'm talking about middle school and the late elementary, maybe. Getting now to the top 16 of the IMDb top 100 poster, I can tell you that we're about to hit a streak of Shilo-Core movies. I won't do this long preface before each and every one of them, but I'll tell you that even though I'm more excited for new stuff than rewatching stuff I've watched ages ago, I'm still hyped to see how my opinions differ now from then, to re-experience some of these movies, and just generally to climb my way to the top of the poster here. So, yeah, fun times. Now: let's dive into it. The Matrix is a 1999 movie, directed by the Wachowskis (brothers at the time, sisters nowadays), follows a guy named Thomas Anderson - or, as he's known at some dark corners of the internet, Neo. During the day he works in a computer company, and at night he's a hacker who've committed more digital crimes than one can count. After years of searching for an answer regarding the nature of our reality, a chain of unconventional and weird events yanks him out of the safety of his reality and into the harsh truth: Earth is a post-apocalyptic world, ruled by machines, a world where humans have to fight a hopeless war to survive. The first thing I'm going to tell you about this movie is this: it's mostly the vibes, alright? Mostly the vibes. It's a Cyberpunk movie, and it captures this darker, less colorful aspect of darker Cyberpunk in a really fun way. The color grading that turns everything green, the production design with everything being leather and badass sunglasses, and yeah, it's just there throughout the whole movie. I think that because the setting itself is very solid, and the premise works really well with this aesthetic, the movie is so memorable. Just soaked with vibes. Talking about things that this movie is memorable for - and it might sound funny at first, but this is quite an action-packed movie so this is a really central thing here - the fight scenes. Good stuff. The directors have brought Yuen Woo-ping, who's like a really acclaimed martial arts choreographer, and he has done quite a good job here. On every single battle here, each move is so thought-out, well-planned and memorable. I think I can easily recall more than a dozen moves that happen during fight scenes here, probably because besides being very well choreographed and directed, many battles here are so fun and over the top, bending the laws of physics to create a video-game-like spectacle. It works even better considering the weight that some battles have in the plot. When talking about the emotional potency of this film, though, I feel like there's quite a lot of room for improvement before I'm actually emotionally involved here. The characters are very, very simple, and I don't think like there's a character here, maybe besides Cypher, that has an interesting personality. The performances here, combined with the good setting definitely give me some level of involvement, but it's far from having an emotional impact on me. I'm not sure if the movie should've taken more time to build characters - after all, it's a very fast-paced film, which is good, and maybe building the characters more might've hindered the pacing - but still, I feel like The Matrix lacks when it comes to this aspect of the film. Before I wrap my review up, I want to address the philosophy of The Matrix. As every video essay and analysis online can tell you, The Matrix leans on a lot of philosophical ideas regarding truth and reality, going all the way from ancient Greece to France of the 1980's. The philosophy here, though, is very soft and digestible - it's there, of course, and it's central to the film, but the ideas aren't really explored in a way that will shake your worldview, for better or worse. The ideas are interesting, sure, but I just don't feel like The Matrix's approach to that is more than a very soft, simple, accessible version of these ideas. A cool thought experiment, but not a philosophical gut-punch. The Matrix is a grim, action-packed Cyberpunk movie. The philosophical and emotional aspects of the film might be soft and not as well-developed as they could've been, but this makes for a very viby, fast-paced film, that manages to hold your attention quite well. Also, great fight scenes. I'm feeling a 7.2/10 on this one.",negative,2,tt0133093
"Based on the long-running hype surrounding this movie, not to mention the critical raves it has generally received, I knew that one of two things would happen when I went to see this movie: 1) It would truly live up to the hype as one of the greatest movies of all time or, 2) It would not match up. I am not surprised that, given the nature of mainstream, Hollywood blockbusters, that I fall into the second category. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", though exciting in parts, fails to maintain a constant stream of interest and energy, thus making it fall far short of the ""epic"" that many viewers are already calling it. Since most people on planet Earth are already familiar with the story, I won't go into great detail here re-creating it. From a plotting standpoint, the movie has several problems. Since Tolkien's work is so masterfully detailed, it would be difficult to completely portray every character with the depth and understanding that he did. But the beginning of the movie does just that, as the moviegoer is painted an excellent picture of the Hobbit Shire and the beauty and peace that this diminutive-sized but big-hearted race has achieved. But then the movie gets bogged down. Character after character is hastily introduced, as we are pushed through fight scene after fight scene. ""Fellowship"" suffers from the same syndrome that many action movies suffer from: despite the fact that the heroes are constantly pitted against insurmountable odds (in numbers, resources, etc.), they never seem to be in any real danger. And the movie generally stages a fight scene, gives the audience a few minutes to breathe, and then stages another fight scene. Although the fights are done well, what is lost is a true understanding of characters, as we never really get to know any of the main combatants. Worse yet, we eventually forget why they're fighting in the first place, since so many of the fight scenes fail to explain what is going on. Visually, the movie is occasionally stunning. But there are certain scenes (like the battle scene at the beginning of the movie) that look obviously computer-generated. Even the tightest military formation does not move in complete synce unless it is a COMPUTER SIMULATION. I did think that the camera angles and the way that the movie played with the actors' height was pretty great, though. I've heard a lot about how the acting in this movie was tremendous, but this is not a character-driven movie, so how can you tell? Except for Elijah Wood, I didn't feel like anyone really gave a performance worth remembering. There were no bad performances, mind you, but no one (except for Wood) really stood out. The monotony of the fight scenes made me anxious for the movie to end. I could feel the length of this movie, and that's generally not a good sign, unless you're dealing with an historical piece like ""Schindler's List"" or ""Ghandi"", where the time isn't as important as the story that's being told. In the end, this movie is not a ""Star Wars"" or a ""Godfather"" or anything of that nature. It morphs into a generic action feature that presents its audience with some exciting scenes, but ultimately fails to deliver a cohesive movie. I give it a 4/10, since it has some value, but isn't anywhere near the ""classic"" that people are hastily calling it. A final note on this movie being #1 in the IMDB. I wouldn't get worked up about this. Though the database has a great deal of value, weighing the historical importance of movie is difficult. We will have a more balanced picture 10 to 20 years from now about the importance of this movie. Even great movies that seemed like they would last forever after they were released (remember ""The English Patient""?) have faded into the background after a few years.",negative,4,tt0120737
"With Edward Norton and Brad Pitt leading, greatness was inevitable - yet Fight Club still exceeds expectations. It's a masterclass in performance, atmosphere, and subtext. The direction is razor-sharp, the score pulses with controlled chaos, and the underlying message is both timeless and unsettling. I'm avoiding spoilers as much as I can, but this film demands a second viewing - not for missed details or anything of the like, but to recontextualize everything. It's not just entertainment; it's a confrontation with modern identity, consumerism, and suppressed rage. An essential, unforgettable experience. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0137523
"Not sure what to make of it. I had really high hopes when reading all the positive reviews and maybe I was, therefore, expecting too much. It was a bit Kung-Fuey at the beginning (Grasshopper Bruce and the Master) , the special effects were good but overdone. The bat mobile scenes started to wear a bit thin for me and none of the actors impressed me although there were big names, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson. I have always thought that Batman should have superhuman powers so that the action scenes could be a bit more believable for me even although I realise that one must suspend belief when watching any movie based on a comic book. Since they were altering the storyline of Batman's beginning anyway, I would have been happier for Bruce to have been bitten by a radioactive bat and then maybe subjected to cosmic radiation or suchlike so that he could at least fly for real (oh my God ! why am I writing this ?) and have superhuman bat-strength or whatever. The movie didn't really click for me although I don't think it is a bad film. I was entertained but it dragged on bit for me (bad sign) so I have to give it a mediocre 5/10.",neutral,5,tt0372784
"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while. Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it. The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion. During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself. The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch. Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed. Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time. This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now. I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!",positive,10,tt0468569
"This Film is a violation to cinema. Director Tom Six presents the third installment to the repulsive franchise (The human Centipede) fingers crossed it truly is the ""final sequence"". It's offensive at all measures, unforgivably insane and transparently foolish. This film rebelliously dismisses the boundaries of film-making and goes overboard purely for shock factor. Dieter Laser's performance was unnecessarily over the top and gave me a headache, however his insults were priceless. There were no character developments resulting to thin emotional attachment towards the leads, but that's obviously Mr. Six' intent as he only cares about its obnoxious content which still lacked fluency and substance. The cinematography was descent but seemed like it was heavily inspired by Robert Rodriguez' style. The practical effects were extremely realistic and the lighting really set the tone which promoted the environment. With these few excuses of my 3/10 rating out of the way, what annoyed me most about this film besides its shameful acting, and crummy direction. Is the fact that Tom six proves to me how cocky a film-maker can become, he plays himself in this excuse of a film and there are literally scenes where characters praise his previous movies and asks for his autograph, like SERIOUSLY? This film is like a bad hangover, it leaves an unforgettable after taste of discomfort and dread. The unintentionally hilarious dialog is its saving grace but at the same time it's no way near forgivable for its constipated plot and pacing. This film takes everything the previous films left out and gives them laxatives and then splatters them onto the screen, is this what you call art Mr. Six, take a good hard look at your career and tell me if you're proud to put this on your resume? After my viewing I brushed my teeth twice and had a long shower. A terrible movie in terms of entertainment and quality, at all costs stay away. Final Rating (Popcorn Metre) 9%",negative,3,tt1883367
"Synopsis: Two detectives hunt a serial killer who follows the seven deadly sins as his method of killing causing mind games and horror to the two detectives. Perhaps David Fincher's best work, Se7en is also considered one of the best murder/mystery films in this whole genre. The film sets the mood and tone of a murder/mystery film epically, causing audience members to pay full attention to the story. You can tell that using each element carefully, the film tries to set the perfect vibe and tone to bring out the best mystery/horror film ever. The lighting and production design of the film is very obvious to be very dark and dim at most times. Creating some sort of fear to audience members as they feel trapped in this city with the serial killer case just as the two detectives are. In addition, the cinematography snd directing comes in to support all of this. By switching to hand held cameras at times where the camera is pointing towards one of the detectives to show instability and fear. To having the camera on a still tripod when the camera is pointing at the serial killer to show how cold and calm he is. The film's introduction to the two detectives right at the beginning of the film, gives audience members a glimpse of who exactly they are and their type of personality in such a short scene. We don't need the whole film to know them, you can just look at that scene and you will know right away. This is so brilliant and it wouldn't be possible without Morgan Freeman as Detective Somerset or Bard Pitt as Detective Mills. Two actors who added too much effort to the story and vibes of the film specifically the dramatic side of it at the end of the film. However, Gwyneth Paltrow as Tracy Mills (Detective Mills' wife), in my opinion added nothing special to the point that if she was replaced with another actress, it would've been totally fine. Her screen time was not that much which many might argue that maybe if she did have enough screen time, she would've shown her acting skills even more, I wouldn't think so. Most of her scenes were with either Brad Pitt or Morgan Freeman which in my opinion, is what saved her. My rating is 9.5/10

"Watched it yesterday and I was shocked how good that was! The acting was 10/10
The plot was 9.5/10
The characters were 10/10
The cinematography was 10/10
The pacing was 10/10
The end was 9.7\10 The acting was so good that I almost believed that Marlon Brando was actually a mafia boss! The plot is a little basic but they made it so good that that's an offer that I couldn't refuse to. The characters were perfect for that movie (specially Don Vito and Michael)
The cinematography was surprisingly amazing! The pacing was absolutely incredible (loved that fact that everyone is wearing the same suit)
The end was fantastic and perfect for such a great movie. I think that it's the perfect movie to see at night alone. Cant wait to see part 2 and 3!!",positive,10,tt0068646
"Boasting an All-Star Cast, a 2 Hour-59 Minute Run-Time, and of course, Martin Scorsese, The Wolf of Wall Street lived up to everything I expected it to be. The way the film is narrated, it was very reminiscent of Goodfellas, which isn't a bad thing at all. DiCaprio was superb as Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker trying to make millions on Wall Street, with his new-found friend, Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) as his right hand man. Chaos, Drugs, Sex, and Adultery are just a few plot points of the film. With Cameos by Jon Favreau, Shea Whigham, Rizwan Manji, and Matthew McConaughey, I'd easily shell out the $15 it would cost to see this film in theaters, and I probably will, because a screener copy is nothing compared to seeing it in the theaters. 9.0/10 (8.7/10 on IMDb)",negative,0,tt0993846
"First, any review with a 1/10 rating....ignore it. Very few films are so atrociously bad to deserve such a rating, and ""Solo"" is certainly not among them. The reviewers stooping to this level are clearly childish and juvenile and quite simply, are not being fair. And they are not worth your time. As much as I disliked ""The Last Jedi,"" it still had a few decent parts that I couldn't rate it a '1' either; TLJ is probably about a '4.' Second, any review stating ""Solo"" 'wasn't necessary' or 'no one asked for this' - ignore it. Here's a question...who 'asks' for any film? Who 'asked' for Rogue One, for example? For that matter, who 'asked' for the original Star Wars back in 1977? Anybody? Surely not the people making this idiotic comment. It's entertainment, people. If you think you might be interested, then go see it. If you don't, then don't go see it. That's not a hard concept to understand. The film - or any film, really - doesn't need to justify its existence for you, or prove its worth. BTW, ""Solo"" was in fact George Lucas's idea....he began working on it BEFORE he sold the franchise rights to Disney. So if you think this is a Disney 'cash grab' - guess what, you're wrong. Go tell George Lucas that ""Solo"" was unnecessary. Now, on to the film...I will admit up-front that I would not have gone to see this if Rian Johnson was involved with it. ""The Last Jedi"" was disappointing on so many levels, I was ready to swear off any future SW films. I am still not sure if I will see Ep. IX....but when I heard Ron Howard was taking over, I decided to give this a chance. And am I glad I did! Is this film perfect? No. I can do without Lando's droid, for one. There are a few plot twists at the end I am still trying to work out in my head. But overall, a really good, action-packed film. And guess what? None of the characters float though space. No eye-rolling ""Poe"" attempts at humor. No character-trashing moments that make you wonder what you're watching. So for those who were bitterly dejected by 2017's ""The Last Jedi"" - and I was chief among them - I am telling you, it is safe to go back in the theater again. ""Solo"" does a great job introducing the 'origin' stories of the iconic characters Han Solo and Chewbacca. In a way, it's sort of like the Prequel Trilogy, which gave the origins for many SW characters, but not those two. So this film fills in the gaps for them, as the prequels did for Vader, Obi-Wan, C-3PO and many others. For any SW fan, that alone should be enough to entice you. In addition, you get numerous new characters, worlds and adventures....what you'd expect of any SW film, really. And the special effects are very well done too. There is one sequence during the Kessel Run that is particularly memorable, I might go back for that one scene alone. Lastly, and even though this is a SW film, there is pretty much nothing here having to do with ""The Force,"" which I think works to its advantage. So you're not asking yourself 'how can Rey do this?' or 'why didn't Snoke realize that?' etc. etc. Nothing like that to bog the film down. So, overall....a very good film. I am not yet sure where I would rank it among the (now) 10 SW films, but I think I can safely say it's in the upper-half. That would make it Top Five. 8/10. A breath of fresh of air, and highly recommended for SW fans - especially the recently-disappointed ones. Would I watch again? (Y/N): Yes, for certain. Maybe even this weekend.",negative,1,tt3778644

"You can argue with my opinion until we're both nauseous, but you can't argue with numbers. That's why I did the one thing I never thought I would have to do: I literally timed the amount of pointless scenes in this movie. After the cliché ""hook"" opening, there was literally no action for the first 38 minutes of the film. From there, you have a generic 2-minute action scene, and then from there Batman Begins goes into pointless drama (which I'll talk about later) for 22 minutes. That was when I was so bored I stopped timing. Either way, you see my point. More than 3/4ths of Batman Begins is completely irrelevant to the cliché plot (which I'll also talk about later). This movie is so bloated with dramatic cliché subplots and overstuffed with pointless dialogue, honestly, how is it even remotely considered and action movie? I've literally seen straight-out dramas with more action. This is the single, condemning flaw The Dark Knight had, and Batman Begins only elaborates on it to the point it simply isn't even watchable. It is so ridiculously boring and lacking in entertainment, it's a lot like watching a black piece of cardboard in the shape of a man get talked to, talked to, and talked to again for the 140-minute runtime. And none of that dialogue even has anything to do with the generic plot. Why do ACTION MOVIE directors feel the need to inject literally over 2 hours of inane dialogue into their ""action"" movies? If there is a single movie that has ever been made that proves the action genreyou know, the one that actually has actionis dead, bloodied, and buried, it's Batman Begins. Aside from the boring dialogue that plagues the entire film from open to close, the viewer is bashed over the head countless times with clichés. Batman Begins uses even single parody-worthy dramatic cliché that has been used since the beginning of cinema. For example, the opening of the film shows Batman as a generic child with his generic childhood girlfriend, where he has a generic encounter with bats that later shapes his generic personalityall done with cheesy flash-cut directing. Instead of taking cues from the immensely superior (and immensely more original) graphic novels (such as Arkham Asylum) with Batman's back-story, Christopher Nolan does exactly what he does best: he uses clichés such as the one I just listed as an example. This trend is shown through the entire film to the point Batman was so trite and clichéd, he was more laughable than the Batman in the old 70s TV shows. The plot is exactly that: a plot. Bad guy vs. good guy. While this is a kindergarten concept to even the youngest viewers, it apparently wasn't to Nolan. It's an unwritten law in Hollywood: ""If you are working with a kindergarten plot, don't let the audience know it's kindergarten. Add some sort of flashy plot twist or cute spin on how you tell the storythat will throw them all off for sure."" No one, not a single director alive today, knows and follows this flawed law more than Nolan. If you look at his body of workfrom Memento to The Prestigethey all involve pathetic, unoriginal plot lines that he makes seem oh-so-""intellectual"" through his cute metafiction storytelling. Instead of using that here, he does something even worse: he bloats and expands the kindergarten plot out to the point it becomes a self-parody. Batman Begins could have literally been told in 2 minutes, but with Nolan behind the camera, it takes over 2 hours. This is not suspense-building or characterization, this is straight-up being childish with the amount of utterly pointless scenes. It's a 3rd grader bloating out his 2-paragraph English paper to 20 pages just to show off. Or in this case, to win the acclaim of ""fine cinema""-whores who find anything less runtime-conservative than Gone with the Wind to be a waste of time. I'm so glad I have enough intelligence to see past that ridicules thinking. Other flaws: (1) When the action does happen, for a whole whopping 5 minutes, it's just as generic and dull as the dialogue. (2) Scarecrow is unintentionally hilarious due to his cheesy motives and lines. (3) This movie is NOT dark. It just rehashes old dramatic clichés, as I said. It's hilarious to me how movies like this get considered ""dark"", and the mass media uses that in a good way, while truly dark films get critically trashed for being ""disgusting"". Either way, the only thing dark here is the use of dull cinematography. (3) Batman has as much personality as a black piece of cardboard. He runs around yelling, ""Stop! Stop, you bad person!"" over and over again, and this is supposed to be the oh-so-awesome Batman everyone is raving about? He's serious, yes, but he's also cliché and dull and utterly the most forgettable interpretation of Batman ever envisioned. (Again, Nolan should have used the Batman character from the Arkham Aslyum graphic novel, which was both serious and had an actually dark personality without seeming like a piece of black cardboard.) Overall: Batman Begins is not watchable. It's sad so many people will settle for such a pathetic attempt to make Batman serious, ignoring every flaw. Let this be a lesson to Hollywood. You can't just take a black piece of cardboard, put it on film, give it a dramatic back-story, let hundreds of people talk to it about nothing important whatsoever, have a few people punch it, and call it entertainment. Well, then again, considering the success of Batman Begins, maybe you can. 1/10",negative,1,tt0372784
"Considered to be one of the best movies ever made, and I just finished watching it. This mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business. For this movie, I decided not to write a full review as everyone knows how good the Godfather is. It has been an inspiration for all movies that came out after it. The cinematography is amazing, the plot is very grasping, the acting is phenomenal, the script is very well written, the plot twist are so shocking , the three hours run time passes by so quickly, and I could keep going on and on however I would like you to go watch that movie and experience it on your own. You don't have to be a fan of gangster movies to likes this, so you just need to go watch it for yourself as soon as possible and enjoy this masterpiece. Score:9/10.",positive,9,tt0068646
"Disturbing? Absolutely. Brilliant? Not quite. The Human Centipede (First Sequence) is infamous. A grotesque experiment in shock horror that became more of a cultural talking point than a truly good film. It's the kind of movie you don't forget, even if you really, really wish you could. 💀 Plot in a Nutshell Two American tourists (Ashley C. Williams and Ashlynn Yennie) traveling through Germany get stranded after a flat tire and stumble into the home of Dr. Heiter (Dieter Laser), a retired surgeon with a deeply twisted vision. His dream? To surgically connect three humans mouth-to-anus to create one ""human centipede."" The rest of the film follows their terrifying captivity, the doctor's coldly clinical ""experimentation,"" and the group's doomed attempt to escape. ✅ What Worked 1. Dieter Laser's Performance: He is the movie. Cold, mechanical, sadistic like a mix of a Nazi doctor and a mad scientist straight out of a nightmare. His physicality and line delivery (""Feed her!"") are pure horror theater. 2. Concept Boldness: Whether you hate or admire it, Tom Six's idea is disturbingly original. It pushes boundaries and forces viewers to confront their own limits of disgust. 3. Cinematography: Surprisingly restrained. Stark, clinical lighting gives it a surgical, sterile aesthetic that makes the horror feel disturbingly real. 4: Minimalism: The film doesn't rely on CGI or jump scares. Just pure dread, atmosphere, and shock. ❌ What Didn't Work 1. Shock Over Substance: It's grotesque for the sake of it. The story barely exists beyond the concept and the characters are thinly written. 2. Rewatchability: Once you've seen it, the shock is gone and there's little depth to revisit. 3. Moral Void: Unlike great body horror (The Fly, Tusk, Martyrs), The Human Centipede lacks emotional weight or philosophical undercurrent. It's horror without heart. 4. Pacing Issues: The setup drags, and once the ""experiment"" begins, it feels repetitive and claustrophobic. Intentionally so, but sometimes to a fault. 💬 Favorite Quotes & Moments ""My three dogs were very, very sick. So I had to put them down. But I became very unhappy. I couldn't stop thinking about them."" - Dr. Heiter

The surgical reveal: horrifyingly clinical and quiet, with no music to soften the blow. The doctor's triumphant explanation of his plan using diagrams: darkly comedic in its absurdity.

Tusk: Kevin Smith's bizarre horror about a man turned into a walrus. 2. Martyrs: extreme French horror with deeper psychological and philosophical roots. 3.

Raw: intelligent, visceral, and surprisingly tender take on cannibalism. 💭 Final Thoughts The Human Centipede is not for the faint of heart or for anyone seeking a traditional horror experience. It's shocking, disgusting, and unforgettable. But beyond the revulsion lies an undeniable fascination: it's cinema as provocation, daring viewers to confront what truly horrifies them. The body, the mind, and the line between the two. It's a film you'll likely hate, but you'll also never forget that you saw it. Final Verdict: (4/10). Grotesque, bold, and utterly disturbing. A cult horror experiment that's more infamous than insightful.",negative,4,tt1467304
"First of all, I watched the original movie, not the MST3K version, which makes it only worse. Actually, I did not want to watch this movie at all, but due to a lost bet, I had to do it =/ The very first few minutes give you an overall impression about how bad this movie actually is. You see, first of all, I could not believe when people told me that it was THAT bad, I was like ""oh come on, no movie can be absolutely disastrous, that's just not possible"". But Manos - The Hands Of Fate proved me wrong. It was very disturbing, the first ten minutes when they are driving through the desert is awful. Disastrous plot. Disastrous acting. Disastrous dialogues. Very disastrous soundtrack (seriously!!). Nothing makes sense. This movie seems to be pretty short, a bit more than an hour, but be warned. I thought it was about four hours after I finished watching it. It really hurts, sometimes, you hope that your TV will explode so that you do not have to finish watching this piece of crap. To put it in a nutshell, the rumors are true. It is REALLY a very bad movie, and I would even agree that it's the worst (YES, I have watched Gigli yet). There's much better stuff you can do with your time, but after all, I am not too angry that I watched this one because it's a pretty good chance to see how NOT to make movies. This is a crime to cinema, it really deserves a 0/10, but I must give it a 1.",negative,0,tt0060666
"First, let me say that the acting was good, and that Leonardo DiCaprio is a good actor. The bad rating I gave this movie has nothing to do with the actors' performances. I gave this a bad rating because the writing was just bad. The CONCEPT of the movie was excellent. When I first saw the trailer, my imagination went wild. The scope of where you could go and what you could do with a concept like inception in people's dreams is almost endless. But, where did they run with it? Guns? Explosions? Grand Theft Auto? Matrix wannabe? These are the words that came to mind when I watched this. And the plot, if that's what you call it, is nothing. It's convoluted minus the imagination, mystery, and intelligence. It's like they made it complicated so it could SEEM intelligent. But trust me, it's not! About 1/2 to 2/3 into the movie, the ending became VERY predictable. Even so, I thought, ""It's about the journey not the ending. Right?"" Except the journey sucked. How come everybody in this movie only dreams about automatic weapons? I know, I know. There are a bunch of explanations in the movie, but the explanations are terrible and not thorough enough to be believable. For example, the characters explain the assault weapons in the dreams by saying the subconscious had been militarized. What kind of stupid explanation is that? Am I supposed to take that seriously? It seems like the movie is just asking for an excuse to become a pseudo-Matrix action flick. Except the Matrix was much better than this. Well... What a waste of a good concept... but mindless action flicks can be fun, even when they continuously, pretentiously claim to be thought-provoking..... But then there's the looooong drawn out mushy ending that breaks up the action and isn't befitting an action flick at all. So, congratulations Hollywood. You managed to take a good concept of a movie with a great cast, remove all imagination and intelligence, while simultaneously turning it into a mediocre action flick with a terrible ending. Hollywood fails again... 4/10 stars",negative,4,tt1375666
"The Godfather is known for being one of the best films ever made and i have to agree.The performances in the film are amazing,from the raspy-voiced Marlon Brando to the amazing Al Pacino.And Despite the fact that the film is over three hours long it compels you through the whole thing. The Godfather is about an old Don of the Corleone Mafia Family(Marlon Brando).His youngest son Michael has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Michael's sister) to Carlo Rizzi. All of Michael's family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo is looking for Mafia Families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don's lawyer Tom Hagen, the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart. This film is a work of art that remains to this day one of the the best film ever made. 10/10(i wish that i can give it higher)",positive,10,tt0068646

"This is the most terribly made movie I have ever had the pleasure of watching, and as such, is extremely enjoyable. The acting is mediocre at best, and is often not even that.  The gravestones wobble.  When on fire, the flying saucers look like burning paper plates. In some scenes, the time of day switches back and forth several times.  For example, toward the beginning, some gravediggers are working late in the day, around sundown.  At the same time, a plane is flying overhead, and it is almost 4:00 on the plane.  Since the people on the plane describe it as being early morning (although the sun is brightly shining, creating shadows of everyone), one can only assume that it is 4:00 A.M.  Next, the scene shifts back to the graveyard, where it is apparently sundown.  That's only one of many plot holes big enough to fly a saucer through. There is also Bela Lugosi, who died before production even began. Ostensibly seeking Lugosi's box office draw, director Ed Wood put old Lugosi outtakes in.  The result is hilarious.  One scene is used several times, and in between, there is his taller standin who uses a cap to conceal the fact that he is not Lugosi. Another highlight is Eros's description of how the earthlings will destroy the universe by exploding sunlight. I've only covered part of why this movie is soooo enjoyable.  Anyone who wants a good laugh should see this movie For a movie: 0/10 For entertainment value: 8/10",negative,0,tt0052077
"Scorsese is one of the best directors out there and since he has created some true masterpieces in the past I was so keen to watch his newest work 'Shutter Island'. My expectations for this movie were incredibly high which maybe resulted in even bigger disappointment. This movie was - in my opinion - not the next masterpiece that i wish it would be. Once again Scorsese's main character is played by Leonardo DiCaprio with whom he worked the fourth(?) time in a row now. And yes - the whole cast in this movie is doing a good job. Scorsese could also provide a really well directed movie for sure. There are some great images and good camera work in this film. The big problem that the movie has is in its plot. I wont give anything away from it but what really bothered me is the way the story develops. The pace is pretty slow and as I'm looking back there are not many scenes i can remember. No real highlights throughout most of the film. Also the lack of suspense - there was no time in the theater when i was frightened or anything like it ... it goes on and on with lots of dialog and some - really cool - flashbacks to the past of the main character but does not really get anywhere with it. While the ending itself is pretty good again and saved some credit points for the movie it just doesn't work. What a pity because it seems like the whole movie relies entirely on it... The reason it doesn't work is simply because you already got the main ""twist"" half into the movie and you are not really impressed when it finally happens though there are some cool details and kind of a second little twist at the very end. All in all it was a bit of a mess, doesn't really work as a psycho-thriller and though it was well made it did not entertain me a lot. See it or skip it? Well I'm not sad that i saw it but i don't think you have to see it ... maybe rent it for less money when it comes out and give it a try. Cheers. 6/10",neutral,6,tt1130884
"IMDb Top 250: 2 The Godfather is the single greatest film ever made. A lofty claim, but so far there is not a single picture elsewhere that I feel deserves that title. And you're going to find out why. The Godfather tells the sprawling tale of the Corleone family, a mafia family after the Second World War. Over the course of the 2 hours and 50 minute epic, you will see the best drama, characters and atmosphere to ever grace the screen. It starts with the Godfather Waltz theme, an iconic piece. Just like that, the stage is set for the most Italian film ever. I believe it was the producer who wanted Coppola to direct because he was Italian. He wanted audiences to ""smell the spaghetti"" watching this film. Anyway, we then cut to a man's face, talking to an unseen figure, pleading to him for justice. Emotion drips off every word. Every scene in the Godfather has purpose, every line of dialogue has meaning. The camera switches to the other side of the table- Marlon Brando sits, hair slicked, moustache, rose in suit, cat on lap, in all of his glory as Don Vito Corleone, one of the most iconic characters ever. Have I said 'iconic' a lot? Much of the Godfather is. The Don himself, Michael's rise, Sonny's temper, the offer you can't refuse. The setting is very important to the Godfather. 1946 New York is wonderfully put together, as well as the hills of Sicily and for a short period of time, Las Vegas. Every scene is full, no scene is filler. Inside of each scene is dialogue- lots of it. But you'll hang on to every word, because of the content and the flawless delivery. Action in the Godfather is sparse, but like the hits shown, short and brutal. You'll be kept on your toes. Anyone can die at any moment, and they do. The pacing is perfect. The characters are some of the greatest compiled in a film, and any of the major characters could carry a film on their own. The Don's mumble, appearance and honour are perfected by Brando. Pacino convincingly, slowly shows what being in a mafia family can do to even a kind boy who isn't a part of it. Tom Hagen is the logic and calm in the sea of guns and violence. And Sonny, with his temper and tongue steals scenes. Perfectly executed, the sweeping story is so well interwoven you might not get it all on the first viewing. It all makes sense though: everything happens for a reason, and everything is explained. From the beginning wedding, to the diner, and ending with Michael's transformation, the plot of the Godfather is one of the best. I hope I've convinced you to see this masterpiece, or if you've already seen it, see it again. No amount of talking can equal to actually seeing it. Better than Shawshank, better than its own Part II, The Godfather is the best movie ever made and you cannot say you love movies until you've seen the Godfather. See this movie, and order a lasagna. 10/10",positive,10,tt0068646
"I decided to watch this movie when I saw it on the top of IMDb list. and even tho there are many great movies this is kind of movie which would be liked by majority of the world. This is an amazing story about a man during his long-term imprisonment. Morgan Freeman is undoubtedly a great actor and we find him as a supporting actor has been really trendy culture in the modern cinema. The movie has a really great plot, full of interesting dialogues you need to pause if you blink your eye. It really sticks to your chair. I think this is my favorite movie so far as well.

"The cinematography and editing here were really well done. It does a perfect job at cutting together sequences and building the tension. The cinematography here breaks a lot of rules, but it does it at the right time and adds the right effect. The film is very tense and has plenty of scary elements. Would I call it absolutely terrifying? No, but it definitely has scary elements throughout. The performances here are all pretty good as well, Anthony Hopkins gives a really fascinating performance that is made possible by the script. The dialogue and relationships between characters are great, and I'd almost call this a psychological thriller with more than one character as the focus. The score here is pretty good, I wouldn't call it amazing, it wasn't incredibly terrifying or anything but I think that comes from more of general sound design which wasn't the style the film went with here. Overall, I wouldn't call it one of my favorites of all time, but it's worth checking out if you want something more disturbing and a psychological aspect thrown in there. 7.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0102926
"8.2 Rating for this tripe? Wow, did the sheep get caught in the echo chamber and herd for this one! They heard, ""Oh Scorcese! Oh Leo DiCaprio! Oh Jonas Hill!"" and they all fell for it! Haha! Suckers! They got sucked into it just like Jordan Belforte sucked all his clients in! That's the only thing funny about this garbage. And please, don't try to pretentiously turn this movie into some kind of moral message, or some kind of hipster perspective on it because there is nothing deep, profound, or any message about it. Looking back on it, this is one of the most insulting films I've ever seen, and not because of the adult content at all, but because it was really a bad movie. The only part I even remember was DiCaprio high on Quaaludes and having a hard time crawling out of his car and up or down the stairs- that was actually funny to see, but that's it. Sure Robbie spreads her legs in the skirt, woopedy doo, nice meme for the vapid millennial generation. Everything else was pure garbage. And another thing: DiCaprio looks nothing like Belforte. Belforte has an alpha male suave about him when this was going on in real life, while DiCaprio is just playing DiCaprio, and I didn't believe for a minute he was capable of being in charge at that corporation. This whole thing is awful. If you want to see a more subtle and intellectual take on the very important topic, then just watch the far superior ""Boiler Room"" with Giovanni Rabese, Vin Diesel, and those guys from around 2000. It is much more intelligently made and still portrays all of the same material, but just with a little more realism and subtlety.

"Based on Mario Puzo's novel, Francis Ford Coppola's epic crime classic The Godfather still stands as one of the finest and influential films of the 20th century. The Godfather features an all star cast with Marlon Brando headlining the movie and also starring Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire, John Cazale and Diane Keaton. Aging mafia boss Don Vito Corleone (the late Marlon Brando) known as The Godfather is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. Vito is a powerful man and shows kindness to those who give him respect but is ruthless against his enemies. Vito has three sons, Michael (Al Pacino), Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (the late John Cazale) and a daughter Connie (Talia Shire). Michael is Vito's youngest son and a decorated US Marine who served in World War II. Michael remains adamant that he does not want to be a part of the family business. Sonny is hot headed who sees violence as a solution to all problems and impulsively makes rash decisions. Fredo is the weakest of the family and knows that no matter what he does, he can never live up to the families reputation. Connie is Vito's daughter who gets married as the beginning of the movie Carlo Rizzi (Giani Russo) who would later become abusive towards Connie. Other members of the Corleone family include the consigliere and head lawyer Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and street bosses Pete Clemenza (Richard S Castellano) and Tessio (Abe Vigoda). Following a number of fateful events, Michael eventually becomes drawn into the Mafia and eventually takes full control of the Corleone family amidst an outbreak of a mob war which could tear the family apart. The Godfather would be the highest grossing film of 1972 and also received overwhelming critical acclaim. The Godfather would win 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor for Marlon Brando (who declined to accept the award), and Best Adapted Screenplay for Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo. To be honest, it deserved more Academy Awards and Francis Ford Coppola was robbed of the Best Director Academy Award, losing out to Bob Fosse for Cabaret (1972). The Godfather would be followed by The Godfather Part II (1974) and The Godfather Part III (1990). 50 years on, The Godfather is still a brilliant masterpiece. Everything about the movie including the story, the cast and score is still amazing. What more is there to say? It's certainly a movie that will age gracefully over time and will still be as enjoyable as the first time that I watched it. A true classic that earns a well deserved 10/10.",positive,10,tt0068646
"Where to begin? I loved Fight Club, along with many other people, and I would recommend it to anyone who has an 'open mind' and does not get offended easily. Fight Club had a dark feel, with very black comedy and a touch of mystery. Fight Club is about one man's journey through a weird part of his life. He (Edward Norton) has a good job working for a car company, he has nice IKEA furniture in his nice little condo. He was almost a complete man. Until, his condo explodes while he is away and he looses everything he owned. So, he rings Tyler (Brad Pitt), an acquaintance he made on a plane on one of his business trips. He goes and has a few beers with Tyler. After they finish they come out of the pub and Tyler asks him to hit him as hard as he can. After some hesitance he does, Tyler hits him back and they fight the night away. They get a buzz from fighting and that's how Fight Club starts. I won't give anything away but the story twists and turns ways you could never imagine. What made Fight Club so great was a combination of many different people doing a great job.  The novel buy Chuck Palahniuk was brilliant and I personally thought that it could never be brought to the screen and be as good as the book. But, Fight Club exceeded its limits and went a step further with a great screenplay by Jim Uhls, without the great screenplay the film would have flopped. Then there is the extraordinary acting all around, it was undoubtedly Edward Norton's, Helena Bonham Carter's and Brad Pitt's best performance ever and other small roles were played well too, such as Meat Loaf, playing Bob. And of coarse, last but not least, David Fincher. David exceeded all expectations making Fight Club. The film was given the prefect feeling thanks to David's precise direction, if you listen to the commentary and see all the extra features on the DVD you will be sure to know how much effort David put into Fight Club to give it the perfect feel, just like the book. Overall, Fight Club gives us some very strong messages, but I thing the very essence of the film is to take what you want from it. This is a must see for everyone, because in my opinion this is the best film ever made and you will most probably enjoy it. If you don't like it, watch it a second time, it will likely change you opinion. A definite: 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523
"Shutter Island is a movie with Martin Scorsese signature all over it. How fantastic direction can made ordinary plot interesting is the highlight of movie? Nice camera movement, shadow photography, multiple flashbacks and capable cast selection made this one worth watching. Even though plot of movie is not new, Scorsese was able to create engaging trill and suspense out of it. On top of that Lionardo once a cute Titanic boy again shows that he can deal with rustic role with same vigor and success. His eyes and facial expression reveals as much as the crisp dialogs do. He is one of the few actors who make acting looks so real. Only if editor kept it shorter than what it is, will make watching movie more pleasant. All in all, Shutter Island did a nice job and after Avatar, it will be another treat from Hollywood to watch this year. 7.5/10",neutral,5,tt1130884
"Memento, Christopher Nolan's neo-noir gem, is a sharp, disorienting triumph, earning an 8.5/10. Guy Pearce stars as Leonard Shelby, an amnesiac tracking his wife's killer, unable to form new memories. Told in reverse with black-and-white flashbacks, it mirrors Leonard's fractured mind, weaving a taut tale of deception and identity. Pearce is riveting, grounding the complex plot with raw intensity. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano dazzle as Natalie and Teddy, their murky motives fueling suspense. Nolan's ingenious direction, paired with Wally Pfister's stark visuals, crafts an immersive puzzle, while the script - adapted from Jonathan Nolan's story - delivers razor-sharp twists. The nonlinear structure demands focus, rewarding with layered revelations, though its emotional depth can feel secondary to its cleverness. Best watched attentively, Memento holds up even with a side screen. A brilliant, haunting classic, it showcases Nolan's genius and keeps you questioning long after the final twist.",neutral,5,tt0209144

"For this weekend's Saturday Popcorn Time, the Plushie Crew finally sat down to watch Fight Club (1999), a movie they'd heard described for years as one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces ever made. Long before HuzaFy-or most of the crew-had even existed, this film had already cemented its reputation as a defining work of late-90s cinema. With that kind of legacy, skipping it felt impossible. Add David Fincher behind the camera and a cast led by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, and it was clearly a must-watch moment for the crew. From the opening minutes, Fight Club announces its confidence. David Fincher absolutely nails the aesthetic: dark, gritty, hyper-controlled, and strangely hypnotic. The film looks and feels restless, like it's constantly vibrating with tension just beneath the surface. Every frame feels deliberate, from the lighting to the editing to the sound design, creating an atmosphere that pulls the viewer in and refuses to let go. At its core, the film blends psychological drama with sharp social commentary. It's intense, provocative, and often uncomfortable-but always engaging. Rather than relying on spectacle alone, Fight Club leans heavily into ideas: identity, alienation, masculinity, consumer culture, and the quiet rage of modern life. The story unfolds in a way that demands attention, rewarding viewers who stay focused and think along with it. Some moments feel deliberately abrasive or chaotic, but that tension is part of the experience. Willow 🐉 was completely locked in, analyzing symbolism, the narrator's psyche, and the deeper meaning behind every major choice. He was absolutely the kind of viewer who wanted to sit in silence during the credits and talk afterward. Tails 🦊 watched carefully, fascinated by the structure of the story and how details subtly connect, noticing patterns without needing the film to spell anything out. Amy 🎀 was drawn to the emotional damage and psychological weight, even though the aggression and nihilism made her uncomfortable at times-she stayed because the film clearly had something to say. Winny 🐻 found the intensity overwhelming in places and would only watch something like this with the group; he stayed quiet, absorbing more than reacting. Sonic 🌀 enjoyed the momentum and raw energy, riding the film's pulse even when it got heavy. Kuromi 😈 leaned into the chaos and rebellious edge, while Mimikyu 👻 quietly connected with the fractured identity and darker emotional undertones. Sunny 🌞 and Sweet 🍓 focused on the emotional beats beneath the brutality, and Lala 🌸 appreciated the artistry, tone, and visual storytelling woven into every scene. The performances are iconic for a reason. Brad Pitt is magnetic-effortlessly charismatic, unsettling, and unforgettable. Edward Norton delivers a layered, vulnerable performance that anchors the film emotionally. Helena Bonham Carter adds sharpness and unease, completing a trio that feels perfectly cast. Every performance serves the film's themes, making even the most disturbing moments feel purposeful. The cinematography and score elevate everything. Fincher's precise visual control pairs perfectly with the film's mood, while the music amplifies tension and emotion without ever overpowering the story. While the film can feel heavy and confrontational, it never feels careless-every creative choice feels intentional. Overall, Fight Club is exactly the kind of movie that sparks debate, reflection, and rewatch value. It's bold, unsettling, sharply crafted, and deeply human beneath its aggression. For the Plushie Crew's first-ever viewing, it lived up to its legendary reputation-not as an easy watch, but as a powerful one. Verdict: 10/10 - a daring, provocative, and unforgettable cinematic experience. It challenges, disturbs, and lingers long after the screen goes black, making it a perfect (and intense) Saturday Popcorn Time pick for the Plushie Crew.",positive,10,tt0137523
"The movie, of which is probably Ed Norton's best is extremely harrowing, and moving, with a lot of very harsh dialogue. Although enhances an excellent story, plus to add to it, a film in which has only very occasionally been done before, director Tony Kaye has created a master piece, which sets an extremely good example of what may happen to racist people. Having said that, the black and white scenes are unnecessary. Spielberg created 'Schindler's list' in black and white in 1993, and this worked beautifully, setting the field of a dark chapter in human history. This film is completely different, and should always be in colour, sticking with Norton's different hair styles to embark in different sessions in the character's life!

"My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠ 'The Godfather' is a masterpiece, a perfect gangster movie. A film without flaws, blunders and cliches, which pulls me to writing a review and it feels like I know it completely by heart having seen it a million times now. This is a classic, a gangster epic and a bible for cinephiles. A worthy picture, without exaggeration, the best of it's kind. Adapted from Mario Puzo's best-selling Mafia saga, 'The Godfather' is a serious dramatic masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It is genuinely a top-notch film which depicts the blood, sweat and drama of the Corleone Mafia family. The film is a long (running time of 2 hours 55 minutes) and leisurely apotheosis of the Corleone family which marvellously builds up a rich pattern of relationships, meticulously detailing the rituals of an enclosed group. The tone of the film is laudatory and romantic and the extraordinary chiaroscuro of the cinematography completely steals my heart. 'The Godfather' contains famous unforgettable scenes such as the opening wedding celebration, a severed horse's head left in an enemy's bed and the cold-blooded killing happening simultaneously with a baby's baptism. However, my favourite scene in the movie is the one wherein Michael Corleone's new bride dies in a car bomb-blast. Coppola not only superbly created the film, but brilliantly chose his actors. Who knows what the fate of the film would have been without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Marlon Brando is outstanding. His cotton-stuffed cheeks and an almost inaudible whisper perfectly define the style of a reigning Head of Mafia. His presence brings energy to the screen. This was definitely Brando's best ever performance which won him an Oscar which he infamously refused. Yes, the man who made offers others couldn't refuse once refused the movie industry's heftiest honour. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is no less interesting than his father. Michael is kind-hearted and truthful, knowing what his father does, he never wanted to deal in his family's business and participate in criminal quarrels. Al Pacino played his character no less brilliantly than Marlon Brando. Pacino showed the destruction and the transformation of his character: from the uninitiated in the affairs of the family being the young war hero, to the new Don of the Corleone family, possessing an iron will, foresight, wisdom and dignity. For all its cold-bloodedness, the film is most powerful in conveying the codes of loyalty, love, masculine honour and feminine subservience, enterprise and corporate self-interests in a crime-ridden America. In addition to the brilliant acting and excellent production of the film, there is the wonderful music score of the composer Nino Rota. An excellent melody which has long become a classic. 10/10 for me.",positive,10,tt0068646
"The black and white film was a poor choice that eliminated the potential for any visual mastery since Spielberg isn't very good with black and white filming. There simply isn't any beautiful imagery or camera work in this film, a lot of intense set pieces (luggage stacked up, etc) but the camera glides by real quick in a hurry. It's a strange choice not to loom over the set a little longer, considering it is a 3 hour long picture. In the end it is very boring. The first hurdle is the acting level, Leem Neeson just isn't very good. Then this is emphasized by the poor accent from Ralph Finnes, the conversations between the two come across very poorly rehearsed and amateurish. What echoes the filming quality and acting quality is nearly all the scenes with extras, all seeming to be amateurs and not actors with any chops at all. I saw straight through it all, in some scenes the extras are smiling. This is supposed two be the persecution of the Jewish people from the Nazis... Why the heck are people smiling without any context? Also if they are not smiling they are just normal faced, not distressed, angry, confused, in pain or otherwise. This is mirrored by the one dimensional antagonist, who spends nearly every second on film shooting random Jews. It is extremely contrived and I don't believe a single frame of it. This is poorly researched crap made into popcorn material for the sake of pulling emotional strings. Well, it didn't work on me. If you want to see some real mastery and horror shown in this topic then I recommend 'Conspiracy', A HBO for TV movie on a secret meeting that pushes forward the plans for the death trains and concentration death camps... that will blow you away. Failing this, I would recommend Band of Brothers, a ten part mini series that covers american soldiers going to the front lines in WW2. I give this a 5/10 as an average film. Usually this rating and below I give to films I would never watch again, including this one.",neutral,5,tt0108052
"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, directed by Peter Jackson, is a visually spectacular continuation of Tolkien's legendary saga. Expanding the narrative across multiple storylines, the film dives deeper into the conflicts and alliances shaping the fate of Middle-earth. While ambitious in scope and stunning in execution, it occasionally falters under the weight of its sprawling narrative. Elijah Wood continues to deliver a compelling performance as Frodo, whose journey grows darker with the increasing burden of the One Ring. Sean Astin as Sam provides heartfelt support, while Andy Serkis's groundbreaking portrayal of Gollum is a highlight, capturing the character's internal struggle with remarkable nuance. Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, and Orlando Bloom excel in their respective roles, though the divided storylines leave some characters underdeveloped. Jackson's visual direction remains exceptional, with breathtaking battles like Helm's Deep showcasing his mastery of large-scale action. The detailed world-building immerses viewers in the grandeur and peril of Middle-earth, with CGI and practical effects seamlessly blending to create iconic moments. Howard Shore's score once again enriches the emotional and dramatic weight of the story. However, the film's narrative suffers from pacing issues, with certain segments feeling overly drawn out while others seem rushed. The constant shift between storylines, though necessary, sometimes dilutes the emotional intensity and momentum. While the themes of loyalty, courage, and the corrupting influence of power remain strong, the film feels like a bridge between the more focused first installment and the climactic finale. The Two Towers is an ambitious middle chapter that expands the world and stakes of the trilogy but struggles to balance its intricate plotlines. It's a visually stunning epic that sets the stage for a grand conclusion but lacks the narrative cohesion of its predecessor. Rating: 6/10 - A visually impressive but uneven continuation of the saga.",neutral,6,tt0167261
"Probably the most influential film since Pulp Fiction. The film questions reality, morality, manhood, and how the media influences society to be like sheep following one another. More importantly, the film shows us what a normal life can do to you. This is one of those films that you cant watch the once and catch everything--- every time you watch it, you learn something new-- and it's the little things which make you jerk forward, and say ""uhhh never saw that before-- that's clever!"" e.g. the waiters advertised on teh hotel TV in Ed Norton's room work for him...wont be a cinema pest and spoil the rest though. The lighting is costantly at a green/lime light-like buzzing hue to make us feel in a state of non-being, and the sharp editorial implicates the melow state of existing before Norton meets Pitt in teh film. It's the film that put Ed Norton in the controversy line, showing evryone that he's ben in something worthwhile, not mindless hollywood sheep-garbage. It was also the second controversial Film Brad Pitt did before Snatch. Fight club could well of been a solid landmark, surpassing Pulp Fiction, but it's mainly aimed at youths aged 17-34, and doesn't necessarily appeal to people in their middle age because of the speed of the direction, etc. Plus the subject matter only appeals to youths anyhoo. Watch it, then watch it again to see what you missed, then watch it again to see what you missd before that time! Cracking---9/10***",positive,9,tt0137523
"I've decided to watch this movie after spotting it in the IMDB's Top Ten and had great expectations......Don't get me wrong, the idea is clever, the storytelling intriguing and the performances above average, still I cannot explain the presence of this movie in the Top Ten of all times! 6/10",neutral,6,tt0209144
"I know that the first rule of fight club is to not talk about fight club, yet we'll have to break this rule today. ""Fight Club"" must be David Fincher's finest movie. Well, if you want to debate on it rather its this one or ""The Social Network"", that's your decision. Anyway, Fight Club is definitely a masterpiece and must be studied in film classes'. The movie focuses on many social matters: Depression, Insomnia, the weakness of man in the 21st century, capitalism and how people become consumers of objects in order to define themselves. All these subjects are what make this film so compelling and relevant to today's world. Along with the hero's arc of The Narrator (Edward Norton). When we meet Norton's character for the first time, he is a complete zombie and consumer of any IKEA furniture. Until he meets Tyler Durden and loses his apartment. The moment he loses his apartment he starts to redefine himself. Just like Durden says: ""it's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything."" From then on, The Narrator transforms into a new person, see the differences between how he used to walk and act with the facial expressions at the beginning of the film and the midpoint. Later on, the fight club idea comes up, at the start we see Norton's character wanting to feel emotions so he goes to group meetings of people with eternal diseases, he cries and lets his emotions out. But what is more emotional, hurtful and uncomfortable than to fight? Look at it as if self-improvement is a weakness and self-destruction is the right way. Tyler says it himself: ""Self-improvement is masturbation. Now self-destruction..."" The film even goes into bigger depths when the fight club idea becomes a certain cell of rebels and anarchists. Who lash out at the system for lowering their lives. Tyler Durden doesn't really offer a solution to ideologies other than chaos, anarchy and vandalism. So in conclusion, what Fight Club is really all about? Or perhaps what are the answers the movie gives to the dilemma of the story? The first answer is to not go extreme: not towards any idea or thought. The second and final answer to the dilemma lies within the only female character in the film - Marla (Helena Bonham Carter). The final scene of the movie with the exploding buildings, with the narrator and Marla holding hands is a somewhat optimistic messages that love, intimacy, human relations and feelings are the things that give meaning to our lives, and not going extreme and lashing out at each other. Norton and Pitt's portrayals were amazing and deserved an Oscar nomination. Helena Bonham Carter was great. The movie inspired by novelist Chuck Palahniuk was later adapted into the screenplay by Jim Uhls, which many should applaud him for the major contribution to the film. Many have wondered what Fight Club is all about, well than maybe it's just something you should not talk about.",positive,8,tt0137523
"The Shawshank Redemption is more than just a film; it is an enduring meditation on hope, resilience, and the human spirit. Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's novella achieves a rare balance-gritty in its depiction of prison life yet profoundly uplifting in its emotional resonance. It is no exaggeration to call it one of the finest films ever made. At its heart is the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongfully imprisoned for murder, and his friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), a long-term inmate. Both performances are career-defining. Robbins brings quiet dignity and quiet determination to Andy, while Freeman's narration provides warmth, wisdom, and emotional depth. Together, they anchor a narrative that explores injustice, perseverance, and the possibility of redemption even in the bleakest circumstances. Technically, the film is flawless. Roger Deakins' cinematography captures the oppressive atmosphere of Shawshank Prison while punctuating it with moments of breathtaking beauty-the rooftop tarring scene, Andy's escape in the rain, and the final reunion on the beach. Thomas Newman's haunting score reinforces these moments, elevating them to near-mythic status. Darabont's pacing ensures that even at over two hours, the story never drags; every scene feels essential. What makes The Shawshank Redemption extraordinary is its universality. It resonates with viewers across cultures and generations because it is ultimately about freedom-not just physical escape, but spiritual liberation through friendship, dignity, and hope. That it left the Academy Awards empty-handed remains one of cinema's greatest mysteries. Summary: A timeless masterpiece of storytelling and emotion, The Shawshank Redemption is proof that true hope is unbreakable. Rating: 10/10.",positive,10,tt0111161
"Words cannot describe the awe I feel for The Dark Knight. I usually try and wind myself down before getting too hyped over movies, but The Dark Knight was different. This was a Batman movie, almost completely like no other. Somehow, despite being immensely hyped for it, The Dark Knight basically shattered all of my expectations and more. The film focuses on four different characters. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) is still playing the vigilante Gotham loves and fears, but is wrestling with his commitment to the job. Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman) is one of the few good cops left, and is trying to end the crime. Newly elected District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is fighting against the scum of Gotham, and trying to make it a safe place again. And of course, there's The Joker (Heath Ledger), a psychopathic terrorist determined to ensure chaos rules Gotham City. The film handles these plot threads rather delicately. It knows that with the slightest force, it could throw the entire course of the film off. For every moment of greatness these stories development, it reverts and dodges bumpy, cliché-ridden paths. It works because it aims to be unique the whole way through. Writer/director Christopher Nolan (with the help of his brother Jonathan) bit off a lot putting this movie together, but in their dedication to detail and to an inherently complex story, it manages to feel simplistic (and somehow manages to add a bit of emphasis on smaller plot lines involving mobsters and a love triangle between Wayne, Dent and fellow D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Batman Begins' horrendously weak link Katie Holmes)). But in accomplishing the complete synthesis of the main plot lines, the Nolan brothers have also managed to make a truly one of a kind film. Yes, it does build off some ideas from Begins, but it does not depend on them. This film is one that can truly stand on its own, and is an exceptional enough sequel that you do not necessarily need to see the first film to understand what happens here (although it sure does help). It tells its own story, and relies very little on previously related materials. It is what every good sequel should set out to be like. And thankfully, it revels in all the corruption and darkness that the Batman films should have always been about. The grittiness and fearlessness of this film is unlike almost any comic book film ever made, and I doubt it will soon be replicated. But in creating such a screenplay, there is an inherent issue with length. Batman Begins felt a bit too longwinded, and could have rather easily been trimmed. The Dark Knight on the other hand, while it feels too long for true comfort, does not have any bulky areas. It is very spot-on with its scenes, and nearly every scene has a reason to be in the film. If anything was to be done away with, I think the film would have been a much less and not so fulfilling effort (not to mention would lose its thrilling edge it keeps up for the entirety of the movie). So while it does feel a bit too lengthy, it lacks the superfluous nature that films like these usually have. I could have appreciated a few changes made to a near ending action sequence (as it felt a bit too ridiculous and rushed for its own good), but it could have been a whole lot worse. Another area the film shines in is the impeccable special effects. Every last detail is perfect, and not once did I not believe what I was seeing. It amps up everything Begins had, and makes it better. Specific scenes that would have looked horrendously fake years ago look miraculous here. And the speed fighting that plagued Begins has disappeared to a certain extent, leaving the audience a much better way of seeing the action. And of course, the makeup to bring both villains to life (especially a certain 'Two-Faced' character) is beyond extraordinary. It is downright terrifying for how real it looked, at any time. Acting wise, everyone does a fairly great job. Bale, while overshadowed more so than last time, builds upon his pathos-ridden superhero and brings certain three-dimensionality to him. We can see the hurt in his eye, and can see the pain. Even when the majority of his face is covered, he brings an excellent sense of emotion to the character. Much the same goes for Eckhart's Harvey Dent, who spends most of the movie doing what he thinks is right. He is a boy scout for the ages, and delivers a richness and depth to the character I did not think possible. Oldman does another superb job playing Gordon. He was an anchor in Begins, and here he does even more work. Gyllenhaal, while a much better thespian than Holmes, is not given nearly enough to do here. She is not totally useless, but she looks and sounds held back by the confines of the role. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are used very sparingly as well, but when they appear, they do a great job. Which leaves me with Ledger's Joker. Just about everything you have heard about his portrayal is true. He is a complete psychopath, and is totally unrecognizable in the role. You may laugh at some of his shenanigans, but then will take them back when you see the horrifying things he says and does. This brilliant performance is even better than I could have hoped, and is enough to see the movie alone. He may have died, but you will wish he would come back and start acting the moment he opens his mouth. For its small amount of problems, The Dark Knight still manages to be uncompromising in its uniqueness and greatness. It will leave you breathless, and craving more. 9/10.",positive,9,tt0468569
"Life Is Beautiful (La Vita E Bella) (1997) Released 13 years ago, but I only saw it now for the first time. I hate to say it, but... what a waste of time. I lost interest about 20 minutes into the movie, then fast-forward the rest. I don't get the point of the movie. It doesn't work as a comedy: first of all because Benigni is just annoying (yeah, I used to love some of his movies once too. Now I find it annoying) and secondly because we get the point of ""presenting the holocaust to your son as a game"" and there's no need to drag it for another hour. However, the movie doesn't work as a drama/educational either: It just doesn't seem to take any of the situations seriously and it doesn't show the horrors of the holocaust. In particular, I don't get the entire first half of the movie - it doesn't have to do with the rest of the movie at all. I didn't really find the movie offensive, just... a waste of a filmmaker's time and effort. It's funny that Benigni chose the prison camp uniform to have the same number as Charles Chaplin's uniform in ""The Great Dictator (1940)"", as I wanted to give Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator (1940)"" as the example of how to make a masterpiece, dealing with the same subject - while making a comedy. Yeah, it's not easy to make a comedy about the holocaust, especially if you want to make a point and have some serious under-layers. In comparison to ""The Great Dictator"", I would say that ""Life Is Beautiful"" is quite offensive - making fun of the situation instead of letting the viewer feel the horror and seriousness of it. Let me give you a simple example from ""The Great Dictator"" to make my point: ""How many were going to strike?"" - ""Three thousand of them."" - ""Have them all shot. I don't want dissatisfied workers."" This is one of my favorite bits. It's so funny, yet Chaplin didn't put it just for the joke - he put it there to show how cruel the Dictator is and REALLY teach about the situation and conditions. Benigni does just the opposite: He makes stuff up just for the sake of being funny - I couldn't find any value in his jokes or in the script in general. To sum it all up, Chaplin entertains the viewers while at the same time letting them feel and understand the horror. Benigni completely detaches the viewers from the situation and his entire purpose is to make them laugh. Comparing Benigni to Chaplin is like comparison DreamWorks to Pixar. I honestly don't understand how this movie got so many praises. 2/10 Horrible. Go watch ""The Great Dictator"" to learn how to handle this subject.",negative,2,tt0118799
"First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it. I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more. The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don."" It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better. 6/10",neutral,6,tt0068646

"OK I watched this last night and I am simply amazed. I would consider myself a comic book fan but Batman Begins makes other superhero movies look ordinary. This is without a doubt the single best superhero movie and it will be hard to see anything surpass this. The film and story itself are very dark. It reminds us of how troubled a character Bruce Wayne actually is. The way his character is developed is also great. The action is superb and thank god it has very little CGI. Up until this I would have regarded X Men 2 as the best superhero movie, but it easily surpasses that. This movie succeeds in every department. It feels much more realistic compared to other superhero movies. It has villains who are actually not likable, usually in superhero movies you come out talking about how great the villains were. This movie does not allow you to do this. It makes Bruce Wayne/Batman the most interesting character. But what strikes out about Batman Begins is that it attempts to be serious and actually succeeds. Spiderman 2 tried this but was a bit like a semi chick flick, The Hulk tried it and fell flat on its face, but Batman succeeds where others failed. The performances from everyone were great. This movie had a wonderful cast of acting talents and they all deliver. Christian Bale is the best Batman ever, he even surpasses Micheal Keaton. He delivers a brilliant performance. And a special thank you to the man himself Christopher Nolan. Thank you for diminishing the sad memory of the previous 2 Batman movies. This is the Batman movie the world has been waiting for and I'm sure people are eagerly awaiting your next instalment in this franchise. I recommend this movie to everyone. Its a superhero movie for a more intelligence audience and not just little kids. 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0372784
"With this film, where do I begin? The Dark Knight was one of the greatest films I have ever seen. The directing, writing, acting, and visuals were all incredible. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was chilling, eerie, and believable. Everyone else was excellent as well. Nolan is now one of my favorite directors of all time. He has proved himself as a director, and will go down as a legend. This was much more than your average Batman movie. It was a more dark and on-the-edge- of-your-seat crime drama than a superhero movie. Plus, there are relieving comedic moments that keep the film entertaining, along with all the action sequences that keep you begging for more. This was a speechlessly brilliant masterpiece.

"Certainly the most massively overrated movie of all time. I finally saw it today, out of sheer curiosity, after avoiding it for so long. I usually avoid movies involving the mob, true crime, horror, or overly violent movies- but I wanted to see what the fuss was all about. I still don't understand. I am reminded of Hannah Arendt's expression ""The banality of evil"", which she coined after observing Adolf Eichmann's trial in Jerusalem in 1961. To her, Eichmann seemed to be a common man, evidenced in his transparent superficiality and mediocrity- ""not stupidity but a curious, quite authentic inability to think."" Critical thinking especially. Perhaps I am predisposed to feel this way, growing up in an intellectual family with high moral standards- evil is quite boring to me. I was originally going to rate this 2/10, and then I found out the actress who did the only nude scene, in one of the few hopeful periods of the movie for one of our main characters, was only 16 at the time. Eww. Legal then but not legal now. Still don't understand what the fuss is about.",negative,2,tt0068646
"Everyone's saying this overrated film is one of ""the greatest films of all time"" - NOPE! I'm saying it's Groundhog Day! WHY?? Because that one is a GOOD film - with meaning, creativity, fun, likability, and enjoyment. Unlike this, it makes you WANT to do fun things like it features, when watching it. Watching ""the Godfather"", I feel, ""No, I don't want to do or watch these things"". Most of this film is rather just boring & confusing! Everything is shot in the dark (or with a dark filter); you have to make sure you've got something else to do while viewing this *masterpiece.* It's way too long. And it's certainly NOT ""flawless"" - I've spotted a WHOLE bunch of flaws with this flick, that they'd have to be put into many notes! Remember, no film is without flaws. A summary of the flaws with this film are confusing story lines, corrupt characters, crime, violence, some filthy language, bad attitudes, even the false cult of Catholicism being featured, rudeness, mind-aching distressing corrupt plot inconsistencies, or scenes that just don't make sense or just annoy the bazzerk out of you! I couldn't care less if almost all critics everywhere have given it glowing reviews, I don't care if it's generally considered a ""masterpiece"", and I don't care if it has a 9.2 out of 10 on IMDb. I can't believe I fell for such a deceiving look. I'm sad that they've refused to see how horrible it is. The fact is, films have quite the tendency to be either underrated or overrated these days. Seriously, this should be turned around! All the attention towards the ""Godfather"" series should be given instead towards ""Groundhog Day""; all the awards given to the ""Godfather"" series should be instead towards ""Groundhog Day"". It's THAT good! Please check it out! And plus, Marlon Brando's brought into this flick, and given one of the stupidest accents in film history; sounding so nauseated and drunk, with his chin thrust out so far, it makes me think he's turning into Jim Carrey. This film's also one of the biggest reasons why I don't care about Al Pacino as an actor; how he almost always seems to have a fetish for hardcore violence, swearing, and playing all-round unromantic, unpopular, and unlikable characters. Undoubtedly it was this flick that started a whole film career of mistakes for Al Pacino - I guess he's kind of cool, just not as much as people make him to be. Though to be fair, I do give credit to this film for not including one f-bomb at all. But overall, I think this is certainly one of the worser movies I have seen, and I'm GLAD I didn't watch it growing up. 2/10 PS: I'm a movie buff who tries to like every film I see.",negative,2,tt0068646

"The Wolf of Wall Street is an absolute ride. It's based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, this stockbroker who turns Wall Street into a circus of drugs, money, and insane behavior. It's crazy from start to finish, and somehow, it never slows down - even though it's three hours long. Leonardo DiCaprio kills it in the lead role. He's unhinged, hilarious, and charismatic the whole time. That scene with the Quaaludes? Iconic. Jonah Hill's great too - just as crazy, but in his own weird way. And Margot Robbie stood out since this was one of her breakout roles. The movie doesn't try to teach you a lesson or judge these people. It just throws their insane lifestyle in your face and lets you react to it. Some people think it glamorizes the whole thing, but I saw it more as a dark comedy - like, this is so over-the-top, it has to be making fun of them. That said, it's not for everyone. There's a ton of swearing, nudity, drugs, and just straight-up chaos. If that's not your thing, it might be a bit much. But overall? It's entertaining as hell.

"Talk about undeserved Oscars  This movie definitely didn't deserved them . It's a sad thing that Academy decided to honor Scorsese with Oscar not only so late , but also with movie that didn't deserved it one bit . It's even more sad that so many people think it's a good movie . I disagree with that opinion. The movie suffers from bad acting from the three leading stars : DiCaprio , Damon and Nicholson. Matt Damon doesn't act at all . He just is in this movie . He breaths , he has open eyes and he speaks. That's it. Jack Nicholson plays his part in such way that would fit Burton's ""Batman returns"" . He's overacting . He's campy , cheesy and not one bit dangerous. Unless you think that killing and eating a fly makes him dangerous . DiCaprio is also overacting , but at least he's switching from being ""very nervous"" to ""very angry"" from time to time. And who the f*** casts Anthony Anderson in a serious role of cop ?! That fat and unfunny piece of meat sticks out here like a sore thumb. The supporting actors are surprisingly much better than the trio of stars . Alec Baldwin , Martin Sheen and oh my God Mark Wahlberg give the best performances of the movie. I wasn't surprised by the fine performances of Baldwin and Sheen . I didn't expect Wahlberg to give such a good performance as the tough asshole cop. It's his best role since ""Boogie nights"". The movie has it's share of rather ridiculous twists that are hard to swallow . There is a big plot-hole involving a certain object that seems to be important for the story for almost 70% of the movie , yet it strangely disappears and none of the characters seems to care ! Not to mention the indestructible cell phone. The movie is badly directed . Scorsese fails to recreate the psychological tension of the original, so he uses the simple way to do it – by making characters shout very often and punch each other . The wonderful sense of sorrow and tragedy that you could feel in the Asian movie is also gone . Instead there is a lot of loud music . And the shootouts look absolutely terrible , like something that Michael Bay could direct. The movie ends differently than ""Infernal affairs "" and it's a really bad thing . Not to mention that the whole symbol with the rat is just pathetic . In the end you might realize that you have just seen an empty and bad cop thriller. I give it 4/10.",negative,4,tt0407887

Heath Ledgers legendary Joker performance will forever remain as one of the best actor performances ever put to the big screen. Heath literally embodies the Joker here! Directing and atmosphere are amazing, it features an immensely compelling dark story, incredible score, a powerfull message, a sensational and realistic take on Batman and an even more ground-breaking interpretation of his nemesis, notable scarce use of cgi (and when its used it looks amazing, especially as far as Two-Face is concerned).... there are just too many things to praise here... A true cinematic milestone that changed people's perspective of superheroe movies! A solid 10/10.",positive,10,tt0468569
"I agree with most of the comments I've seen so far. The acting was horrible, the lighting and camerawork sucked. The editing has to be the worst I've ever seen and the dubbing was so bad it made you wonder if they even viewed this when it was overdubbed or just read lines in a tape recorder. This is one you have to medicate yourself (with your choice of substance) before watching. Yeah it's a stinker, but is it the worst? Not by a long shot considering they only had $19,000 to work with. I knew in the first ten minutes that this was going to be the most amateurish looking movie I had ever see, even worse than Cornman: American Vegetable Hero. But still, with a gun to my head and a choice between this movie and Volcano, Manos, The Hand of Fate would be my pick. I'd give it a 1.5/10",neutral,5,tt0060666
"First of all I wonder if this script is based on a 14-year-old's wet dream. No one else could come up with so many bad excuses to show nudity. The logical flaws are all over the script. The main character gets a ride to Vegas, but even after many many miles on the road they don't seem to talk about what she is going to do in Vegas until they reach the city limits. Not very likely. The acting is much worse than each actor's normal performance. Poor Kyle Maclachlan, he probably doesn't even include this on his resume. A poor script usually creates bad acting. Only in ""The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies"" have I seen more unnecessary dance numbers. These are more daring (not hard to be) and not as bad, but that does not make them excusable. The plot is not as stupid as porns, but not much brighter. The movie is so bad I actually recommend people to see it for that reason. If MST3K make a TV comeback I am sure this movie will be included on their list.

"Extremely Wicked chose an unexpected direction in it's narrative, which is both the film's selling point, but also its biggest flaw. The movie is based on Elizabeth Kloepfer's book about her experiences as Bundy's girlfriend in the 70s, and how the aftermath of his killings affected her emotionally. This is a really interesting direction to take the movie, for sure, but ultimately it still falls into the background behind the Bundy drama itself. For most the movie, Liz is just a crying alcoholic watching the TV out of misplaced guilt. If they had doubled down on this element more, we could've gotten a really interesting perspective on a character left torn and confused for over a decade. She feels guilty for putting him on the authority's radar, and now, if he truly is innocent, she's put him through hell and ruined his life. The uncertainty as to his guilt at the time would've been a really interesting thing to explore on his loved ones, especially Liz. But as I said, instead she's just reduced to a crying, drinking mess. Extremely Wicked attempts to balance Liz's story with that of Bundy's himself. This is the movie pretty much everyone expected, but even here it disappoints, even more so considering the documentary that we've all just seen a few months ago. Berlinger had a fantastic opportunity here to really delve into the disturbed psyche of Ted Bundy. In the freedom of a movie, he could have taken the opportunity to play around with the facts a little, embellish certain events, fictionalise things that were never documented. Bundy is pulled over and arrested, and he escapes custody out the library window, but instead of showing his week missing, hiding out in a cabin in the mountains, we immediately cut to him having been caught. His second escape gets the same treatment. We see his planning and his method, and then cut to two weeks later with news reports in Florida of the Sorority killings. And then he gets pulled over and arrested again. This was the most interesting part of the entire story, and it's glossed over and ignored entirely. Rather than taking the opportunity to flesh it out, fictionalise what transpired, and delve into the real character of Bundy, we cut straight back to documented facts and real-life news reports. In the documentary this was acceptable and expected, but into a dramatic retelling of the events it just ruined the flow and pacing of the movie right at its most crucial and interesting points. The film opens with, honestly something I thought was complete genius. Liz and Bundy meet in a bar, he's depicted as charming, kind, and respectful. He becomes part of the family unit and helps raise Liz's daughter. We get a montage of fictionalised family footage interspersed and narrated by actual news reports of his escapades around Washington and Colorado. This juxtaposition, without any other context, created a real feeling of unease as we watch this kind-hearted family man become painted as a monster in media reports. We also get a fantastic close to the story with Bundy and Liz talking the night before his execution, where he finally gives her, and us, the answers we seek in the most disturbing and gut-wrenching way. The way this handsome, charming man, knowing the pain the truth would cause, gives in and finally gives Liz what she's needed for over a decade. It's as beautiful as it is harrowing. But these are the only two glimpses and embellishments we get to really dig into Bundy as a person. Other than that it's just a dramatic retelling of what was already filmed at the time. So here's what I would have done. I would have either doubled down on Liz's story, and focussed on her grief, guilt, and denial, placing Bundy, the escapes, and the courtroom dramas squarely in the background, or I would've doubled down on Bundy, the drama surrounding him, explored his character and his motivations, as fictionalised and embellished as they may be, to make an entertaining story out of him. Or I would've sought out a mini-series format, spread it over a season of episodes, balanced and thoroughly developed both perspectives and characters, and not felt the need to rush through the most interesting plot points. As it is, Extremely Wicked tries too hard to do too much all at once, leaving everything it tried to do feeling shallow and rushed. Zac Efron was great though. He absolutely did not disappoint. He had Bundy down to a tee. He's as charming and charismatic as Efron always is, perfectly embodying the personality of Bundy we saw on screens, but in those small glimpses of something darker Efron doesn't skip a beat. And this makes the film's decision to not even look at that darker side even more infuriating. The darker Efron we get is so small and quick it's not enough to savour what could've been a really juicy performance. John Malkovich was also great as Edward D. Cowart, the judge who oversaw the televised trial, again tapping into the subtle character layers that made Cowart both authoritarian, but also oddly likeable in those televised sessions. As for James Hetfield? He was barely in it. He appears at the beginning of the movie for not even five minutes, and then he's never seen again. 2/10. Movie ruined. Seriously though, this film is real mixed bag. There's a lot of great moments in it, particularly the beginning and the end, as well as every scene shared between Efron and Malkovich. Even Lily Collins impressed with her descent into alcoholism. But the film tried to have its fingers in all the pies, and the film loses focus as a result. Pacing is all over the place as plot points in the second act are rushed through. Depicting both escapes and re-captures, but having them both resolve within a couple of minutes was doubly infuriating (honestly at the very least I would've just cut the first escape out entirely; it added nothing to the film itself). Ultimate Extremely Wicked is just a dramatic retelling of the Ted Bundy Tapes documentary, and I would recommend that documentary over this movie any day of the week. I give Extremely Wicked an split-down-the-middle 5/10.",negative,2,tt2481498
"When I first went into this movie, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. Sure, it often was on the top of lists of the Greatest Films Ever Made, but that was likely to create nearly-impossible hype. (Which had previously caused disappointment upon my first viewing of ""Citizen Kane"") I had previously found the movie in an article called ""Movies You Hate the First Time but Love the Second."" And it was also three hours long, so it would definitely have its slow scenes. (I was only able to make through the first 90 minutes of ""Lawrence of Arabia"") Cautiously, I turned the movie on. And within minutes, all my doubts disappeared. For those of you who haven't seen it, ""The Godfather"" is the story of Michael Corleone, the son of Vito Corleone, a powerful Mafia boss. He initially tries to distance himself from the family business as much as possible, but he slowly gets drawn in, until his father passes control of the family down to him. So what is it about this movie that makes it such a classic? (""Everything"" would be too obvious and brief, so I'll try to go into more detail.) The best part of this movie is, of course, the acting. Marlon Brando is fantastic as Don Vito, so obviously he really deserved his win of the Best Actor Oscar. (Although he infamously refused the award as a protest against Native Americans' portrayals in film) He really sells the fact that he is a powerful man, but also isn't as bad as one would think, and just cares about the family. Al Pacino as Michael is excellent in all his subtlety, as he goes through his transformation from a really nice guy into the ruthless head of the family. (Although from what I've heard, he goes even further in Part II, which I have yet to see) Diane Keaton as Kay, Michael's girlfriend really manages to stand out in her supporting role despite being surrounded by amazing screen legends in the main roles. James Caan as Sonny is fantastic, Robert Duvall as Tom is great, Richard S. Castellano as Clemenza is just as good, I could go on forever, but I need to finish this up. Another great part of the movie is the script, (Based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo) which wisely knows to focus on and develop the characters, which are very well aided by the fine performances of the cast. The film lets us spend a lot of time with these characters until we feel we know them as well as our own family. (Okay, not QUITE that far, but you get the idea) The way the script handles these characters is brilliant: Despite the fact that they are in the Mafia, they are not necessarily evil. The movie spends a lot of time with them, and they seem like really nice people. (Well, except for the other families) And whenever the characters tell a story, because of how interesting the script makes the characters and their stories, all you have in your head is that story, and it even feels like its own movie. The film has a really memorable score by Nino Rota; it doesn't have to be big or bombastic, it doesn't need to have a bunch of choir members singing frantically, it is more relaxed and melancholy. The cinematography by Gordon Willis is really beautiful, with plenty of shades of orange that perfectly complement the violence and gore of the different murders throughout the film. (Which aren't terribly brutal, but definitely for ages 14 and up) And the film is pretty well edited as well: Despite its long length, it rarely feels like it is three hours long, and when it occasionally slows down, those moments are really far between, and fairly brief. The only real complaint I have about the movie is that some things happen that I felt could have been explained a little more, but that's just me nitpicking. So overall, ""The Godfather"" is flat out amazing, I can't compliment this movie enough. Nearly everything about it is perfect, I give it a 10/10. (But seriously, this only won 3 Oscars? Are you kidding me?)",positive,10,tt0068646
"An experienced police veteran and a young detective, who comes in his place, hunt down a serial killer whose murders are based on seven deadly sins. Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, and Kevin Spacey are enough recommendations for this dark thriller. Great camera and direction, tense atmosphere, scenes bordering on horror, and a good balance of drama and action will keep your undivided attention.

"I first saw The Godfather around 25 years ago, long before I became a film buff. I thought it was good, not great. When registering on IMDB a decade ago I rated it a 7/10 from memory. Incidentally part II I rated a little higher, an 8/10 due to the engaging flashbacks. Ten years of being a film buff...I've seen some incredible works in that time (including two Coppolas, namely his Apocalypse Now & Dracula). Curious if The Godfathers are as good as their 9.2/9.0 ratings on here, I purchased the Bluray-Restoration Trilogy and just now watched the 3-hour first movie...only my second watch, and the first time since 25 years or so. ....and my opinion is unchanged! The Godfather is a good film. It's very well made, with tons of neat intelligent scenes and dialogue. Well acted. Fitting music. Decent camera work. But it's also tricky to follow, a few times I wondered who characters were referencing...this isn't a problem I've had with Goodfellas or Sopranos. Michael's relationship drama with his two wives isn't really that compelling, and neither is the paranoid mob war. The motives of the antagonist mobsters don't feel convincing. A couple of action scenes have dated badly. One scene has Sonny punching clear air but the sound effects are claiming contact. Tho' the death scenes were generally done well and still look good today. Curiously, there's often no offered subtitles when the characters talk in Italian. Specifically an important restaurant scene is missing this. I later watched an online clip with the translation, and I disagree with Copolla: the subs should've stayed in. Also, the image-quality isn't that impressive for a claimed 4k-mastering restoration. Very deep blacks for indoor scenes, meaning you struggle to differentiate among all those black suits. I guess they were going for a chiaroscuro-style (like Caravaggio famously employed in his paintings), so this gets a pass. 7/10 feels absolutely fair. Yet poll after poll still puts this movie right at the top (or very close) in the all-time rankings. Citizen Kane is one of those I feel deserves such a reputation. The Godfather...not so much. Part II next. Let's see if it holds its 8/10 (hopefully improves on it!).",positive,7,tt0068646

"Well, sitting back and watching objectively as I could, I saw The Godfather for the first time last night. I thought that since there is so much reference to this movie in comedy, drama, satire etc, that there must be some substance. Sadly not really. How this movie got to the top of the 250 is a mystery I'll never understand. Even Citizen Kane is a better view than this item. Perhaps this film was groundbreaking in its day, but frankly, Marlon Brando was laughable (as usual), the characters were stereotypical (though I guess they are the model for a generation of stereotypes that came after), and the story unremarkable. Kind of like the Thorn Birds meets Married To The Mob. That said, the film was OK. I gave it 7/10, but it got an extra point or two for having influenced so many other movies.

"Fast cars. Big engines. Big Egos. High velocity action. Michelle Rodriguez. Definitely one of my favourite films based on these factors. TFATF is a high velocity action packed street-racing movie with a simple plot. the story is cliché ridden but it works well incorporating the street-racing aspect and its characters into it. Although to film critics the film is just a mindless street racing movie with a back-story that was made to entertain audiences under the age of 25. Though it is true that the movie draws its audience through the street-racing aspect. The film is not a cinematic classic, however it cannot be placed as another Gone in 60 Seconds because the two movies are not the same. Although both centred around high powered cars, their plots are significantly different. The plot of TFATF is simple and cliché along with some of the dialogue but it delivers on thrills and high intensity stunts. It falls nothing short of hitting the audience with fast cars, sexy women and heart-pounding stunts. The film can appeal to both male and female audiences; sexy women and fast cars for the guys and the motorheads; and the muscle-bound, action-heroism of Vin Diesel for the ladies. Despite the plot somewhat lacking any depth or complexity, the movie is successful in drawing its target audience of under 25's and proves to be a highly entertaining blockbuster smash. 6.5/10",neutral,5,tt0232500

"The Shawshank Redemption is most obviously one of the greatest movies in film history. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make an unforgettable duo that captures the audience in magnificent acting and a well-written plot. There was not one moment where the movie did not hold my attention or seem boring. Therefore, it indubitably earns a 10/10 and praise. A tale of two jail inmates/friends, The Shawshank Redemption shines a light on the injustice of this world and the pleasures of freedom after years of confinement. It proves that through all the troubling experiences, one man never loses sight of his dream. This not only gives Tim Robbins's character a chance of redemption but also chance for Morgan Freeman's character to be inspired by an endless struggle that pays in the end.

"Plot: A group of cyber-terrorists wreck havoc in the USA by shutting everything down and a single cop along with the help of a hacker must stop them. After watching all four Die Hard movies in Blu-Ray I decided that I would review the worst of the series. Yes, you heard that right the worse of the series. Like so many great action franchises of the late 80's, (Rambo, Terminator, etc), it started wonderful, it had a good sequel, the third one was meh and then comes the fourth one which makes you wanna throw something at the TV screen! The plot of all Die Hard movies, although far better than your average action film, was pretty simple. However what it lacked in storyline it made up in building tension and keeping you at the edge of your seat. In the first movie for example, McLane was quite skilled and clever, but he was just a single guy who could bleed, who was afraid and who was always outnumbered. In here however the whole movie is just an excuse for loud explosions, gunfights and car chases you know popcorn entertainment! Moreover McLane seems to have gained some supernatural powers, withstanding WAY too much damage contrary to the more realistic McLane of the past. Willis handled the protagonist's character pretty good so far. He was badass but he was also human. He was witty and charismatic but he was also quite realistic, an action hero that you could actually like and give a damn about. Here he is just a blunt, generic protagonist. Also, instead of the genuinely sweet romantic chemistry between him and his wife we now have the typical garbage of the 21st century. Divorced with a daughter who hates him and yada, yada, yada what happened to good ol' romance in our days? (Cthulhu, I feel old!). Finally the annoyance called Justin Long, whose character is supposed to be the comic relief here, but instead he ends up being an irritating sidekick who I wish would die as soon as possible. The worst disappointment comes from the bad guy though. We had Hans Gruber who was magnificent, then we got Colonel Stuart who was quite decent and then we've moved on to Simon Gruber who was okay, I guess. Here the bad guy is a boring, walking mass of non-menacing nerdness. Instead of the powerful aura of Hans Gruber, Thomas Gabriel made me feel that I could kill him just by using foul language. Furthermore the misc. characters here consist of nameless bystanders and generic goons, where in previous Die Hard films you could actually remember their names and faces. Oh, and lets not forget the extremely stereotypical Kung-Fu Asian bitch that almost all movies have these days *throws up* It's all badly directed and meaningless action scene after meaningless action scene and like in most modern films everything is color-filtered with an ugly glue-grey that is supposed to make everything cooler but instead makes it look dull. Finally like with most action flicks, everything simply defies logic and while I can deal with some stupidity when it comes to Hollywood-made action films this is plain ridiculous. Some cyber-terrorists destroy a whole country with a couple of Alienware laptops while a single hacker tries to kick their digital asses with a help of what else? His own laptop!!! Boring, stereotypical, way to predictable and as adrenaline pumping as sharpening a pencil, Live Free Or Die Hard is a stupid piece of US Propaganda, perfect for cinema zombies, but not for those who appreciate the art form of movie making. Avoid!!! FINAL VERDICT: US Propaganda meets Popcorn Entertainment (2/10) [+] Err popcorn tastes good! [-] Boring, non-existent plot and dull, stereotypical characters. Action scenes that will make you feel sleepy. Hollywood made US Propaganda at its worse. Ugly color filtering.

"Martin Scorsese directs the story of a man that reached fortune by becoming really good at doing illegal activities and eventually got in trouble with the law in part for his careless behavior and in part for the bad companion he associated with. One of the few good things of the movie is how it accurately describes the aggressive and intense scene stockbrokers and sellers in general live in, unfortunately that had been done before and done better. Other than that, the movie is just a collection of depraved anecdotes set in slow-mo sequences with cool music (usually ""borrowed"" from other movies) and that makes it a genuine snore fest (literally, there were people snoring in the audience) I really wanted to like it, but it turned out to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, and I've seen the 'English Patient'. I really don't understand why the movie tries so hard to rub in our faces Jordan Belford's excessive and decadent lifestyle, which btw wasn't as shocking as I was expecting. It's funny how critics bash repetitive action and destruction scenes in movies like 'Transformers' or 'Man of Steel', but praise repetitive morbid scenes in movies like this one, when in both cases is a tedious experience. For the first time ever I found myself attending a movie in which I wasn't interested in anything that was going on or cared for any of the characters and when that happens one starts noticing a lot of continuity and edition mistakes that not even direct to DVD movies have, like when a character is supposed to be speaking but even from a behind shot we can see the actor isn't talking at all or the infamous Leonardo Dicaprio ""magic pants"" scene. But the biggest sin of the movie is that it sacrifices the essence over the form, and by that I mean the pace of the story. Once you get over the so called ""controversial"" scenes, you realize the pace is slower than grass growth, because the story didn't need a 3 hour movie to be told. The length of the movie was a consequence of the depraved overkill. Don't believe me? Take agent Denham for instance (the character played by Kyle Chandler) he was introduced 10 minutes into the movie, so we have a pretty good idea of his role in the story and where it's going, however the character speaks his first line 90 minutes after he's introduced (that's right, I was so bored I started timing things like that) Grasp that for a few secs. Ninety minutes! I could have walked out, watched 'Gravity' (again) walked back in and the character wouldn't have yet said anything. And how does the plot unfolds in those 90 minutes? It doesn't, all we see is sex, drugs and partying over and over again. I haven't read the book but I believe Scorsese could've made the movie more engaging if instead of focusing so much on Belford's life would have shown how his actions affected people, I mean we're talking about lifetime savings that were robbed and that resulted in broken families,hundreds (if not thousands) of people losing their homes, their health and even their lives. It could've at least bonded emotionally with the audience. But the fact is, if you've seen the 2 min trailer you already know 90% of the story and even worse, the remaining 10% has also been done before and done better when it was called 'Casino' (btw, the first paragraph of this review was copy / pasted from a review of that movie) which was an exciting story, however when seen in WoWS it seems wasted and clichéd and of course you may also take into account that even when their performances were good, Jonah Hill is no Joe Pesci, Margot Robbie is no Sharon Stone and unfortunately Leo Dicaprio is no Bobby Deniro. So my recommendation is sneak in, wait until McConaughey's performance is over and then leave. Don't believe the hype 4/10",negative,4,tt0993846
"Fight Club is one heart pounding and intense film! I rented this film along with a couple others last night hoping that this movie was going to entertain and please me. It sure did! The actors were all great especially Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden. This is one of Brad Pitt's best roles to date. The script and the directing was excellent adding also great dialogue expressing the characters. David Fincher does excellent in my opinion and this is the first film I have encountered in his films and I will sure to be paying more attention to all of them.

"i'm not sure what the big deal is about this movie.i mean,it borrows heavily from other sources,such as the bible and Star Wars,among others.the gist of the story is that the world people see around them is isn't real.it's actually a construct made by machines.Humanity is actually enslaved by the machines.but there is one man who can free humanity.that man may be a hacker who goes by the name Neo.Neo is portrayed by Keanu Reeves.also playing prominent roles are Carrie Ann Moss and Laurence Fishburne.but in my mind,it is Hugo weaving who steals the show as the enigmatic agent Smith.i will admit the movie has some great special effects and some spectacular fight scenes.but some of the moves in the fights are really silly and are not what i would call practical.also,a lot of the movie is slow moving,and the characters don't behave in logical ways.still,the movie does have its good moments.there are some genuine moments of high tension.this is the first of three movie in The Matrix franchise.for me,the first movie in the series is a 6/10",neutral,6,tt0133093
"I guess you can't make everyone happy and maybe the Star Wars franchise is getting divided into separate series because of that. I hated Last Jedi (3/10) and yet it was praised left and roght. It made me was very unsure about Solo, but this movie redeems the Star Wars for me. And yet the critics hate it. For me it is a perfect adventure movie. A western in space! It lacks pathos of Last Jedi and brings in charismatic characters (young solo is awesome), fun settings, chases, adventures, duels, friendships. Don't believe the critics on this one. Go and see it, especially if you were disappointed in previous entry to the saga.",negative,3,tt3778644
"99% critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes, which is the Highest rated DC and Marvel movie EVER! And an 8.6 IMDB rating...so i had high hopes going in, plus i love the previous Spider-Man movies but boy was this one average, below average actually hence my 4/10. I feel duped by the critics AGAIN. The critics scores for this movie are WAY too suspicious for this. Let's get the animation out of the way first since they seem to be raving about it so much. Through watching many many animations we all know that nice visuals don't make for an entertaining film, especially if the other components of storytelling don't add up. The animation was as good as any good ones out there already, so i would say that it's not a good reason to go and spend loads on money at the cinema for that reason alone. This definitely can be watched at home. At random times throughout the film they do this kind of 3D visuals animation which give your eyes and head a funny turn tbh. If you've watched a 3D movie without glasses then you'll know what i mean. The film was so haphazard editing and story wise that it really took you out of the flow of the story, so it made it difficult to stay connected to the characters and story. This made it feel like it was aimed at young children to stop them from losing interest. It almost just felt like constant random scenes which didn't flow smoothly story wise. The other thing that made the film tiresome when trying to connect to the characters/story was the use of jokes/one-liners, they were relentless and was full of them. I love comedy in superhero films, the MCU do a great job of that and the previous Spider-Man movies too but this was like a kids animation style of non-stop but with adult humour, that i'm afraid i didn't laugh at once...and i usually laugh at nearly everything. Besides myself, there was only an adult and 2 children in the screen and i didn't hear them laugh either tbh. The story was pretty standard, exactly what the trailer tells you but i did get restless and bored when there was no action. Its my least favourite Spider-Man movie and as animations go its not good either, especially when you've got Pixar, Illuniation, Manga, etc delivering such epic and fun movies already. Nicolas Cage was my favourite Spider-Man in this, even though he wasn't one of the central characters and didn't get much screen time. It would be great if they made a film just centered around his character sometime. There were 2 or 3 short emotional scenes in this that i liked, i'm a sucker for that stuff lol. There is a post-credits scene so stay til the very end. 4/10.",negative,4,tt4633694

"What a dazzling Spielberg gem that gets a 8.5/10 and my full recommendation! Leonardo DiCaprio is electric as Frank Abagnale Jr., a teenage conman pulling off wild scams as a fake pilot, doctor, and lawyer in the 60s, always one step ahead of Tom Hanks' relentless FBI agent, Carl Hanratty. Their cat-and-mouse game is thrilling, funny, and surprisingly heartfelt. The interval chase scene is pure magic, perfectly blending tension and charm. DiCaprio's charisma carries every con, while Hanks grounds it with quiet grit. Christopher Walken's turn as Frank's dad broke my heart - those scenes hit hard. Spielberg's direction, paired with Janusz Kaminski's vibrant 60s visuals, makes every frame pop, and John Williams' jazzy score is a total vibe. Jeff Nathanson's script balances humor and emotion, though a few moments drag slightly. This true-story caper is clever, moving, and endlessly rewatchable... a must-see that proves Spielberg, DiCaprio, and Hanks at their best!",neutral,5,tt0264464

"Martin Scorsese has done it again. Went to see this film Christmas day, and expected to see some great acting, great directing, a dramatic take on the stock market and wall street, but what I instead got was a hilarious, thrill ride of a movie. The film is rather long, but it won't seem that long as there is always something happening. Leo posted one of his best performances to date. Meaning he SHOULD get nominated for an award..but he always gets snubbed so you never know. Jonah Hill though, he was as good as Leo was in this movie, not better of course, but as good as. I didn't even see Jonah on screen, he was so transformed into another character and not his usual character. Loved to see that in the film. Not gonna spoil anything in this but it was hilarious to see them two work together in a Scorsese film non the less. This film has been advertised as a comedy, and totally delivers with laugh out loud scenes and dialogue. The film deserves a hard ""R"" rating due to the graphic nudity, language, and lots of drug abuse. So be careful who you bring to see this. I loved this movie, one of my top movies of all-time. 9.3/10",negative,3,tt0993846
"Today I was planning to watch Flashback Movie, but by chance I saw that The Godfather 1 was playing at the cinema. Honestly, I'd already watched it at home before and gave it a 7/10, but seeing it today on the big screen changed a lot. The details in the scenes, the lighting, and even Nino Rota's soundtrack felt much stronger. The mafia atmosphere came through in a deeper way, almost like I was experiencing the story for the first time. This time, I really enjoyed it more and gave it an 8/10.

"Fincher's cult masterpiece has aged fascinatingly; watching it in my late 40s vs early 20s is a vastly different experience. Don't worry, Tyler Durden is still cool, and Ed Norton is still one of the best actors of his generation, but the depth to this film is more apparent the older I get. Norton is the Narrator, an office-bound schlub with severe insomnia and an addiction to support groups. He soon meets two people who will change his life dramatically; Helena Bonham Carter's Marla and Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden. Both actors deliver an acting masterclass, particularly Pitt, who chews up every scene. The film nails the 1999 era of confused masculinity, unrealised and largely undefined anger among young GenX males and the commercialisation of pretty much everything. And it's a wild, crazy and unpredictable journey, so strap in. 9/10.",positive,9,tt0137523

"The Godfather - Crime, Underworld Movie
Cast - Al Pacino, Marlon Brando It is the highest-rated movie of all time. I found it realistic about underworld life. I have never seen any movie adapted from a very linear simple story but picturized with an awesome screenplay. The acting of every male character in this movie was top notch though all the female characters were more than dull. I liked the patience and planning of a godfather and how he deals with his enemies. There were some heavy dialogues delivered perfectly. However, I did not like the story that much. It is more than good according to the year of its publication. But still, there is nothing to learn from this movie. This movie is enjoyable at the same time boring. The story is also predictable and there are some unnecessary scenes in the movie. I will recommend this movie as maybe this movie does not reside with my taste but others may like it so much. Finally, I found it overhyped and overrated. Personal Rating - 6.5/10",neutral,5,tt0068646
"After many years of training, Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham as the Batman to stop the continuous corruption of his city. This film is incredibly well made and really showed that with enough talent comic book movies can be as good as any other film. Christopher Nolan is a film making genius and this movie again shows his talent. Technically this film is flawless, incredible cinematography and music that make every scene mesmerizing. This movie dives into the evolution of Bruce Wayne and makes us want to care about the guy behind the mask. Nolan is able to give us a fun superhero movie without sacrificing the development and story depth, which makes for an amazing film. Christian Bale leads a star studded cast including the likes of Michael Cane, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Katie Holmes, Cillian Murphy. Across the board perfect and each character is given enough screen time to show their talent. The action scenes are also very well done. In particular the dock scene where we see Falcones (Tom Wilkinson) men receiving a shipments is very well done and adds in some nice horror elements. Overall this film is more than just a comic book movie. Nolan gives us a well written story while also providing us with some quality action scenes which makes Batman Begins another great Nolan film. 9.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0372784
"From the moment the opening scene started off, I knew this movie was going to be something special, unlike anything I've seen before. And man was i right. The Dark Knight is without question, the best Super Hero movie ever made, no contest what so ever. Not only is it easily the best Super Hero based movie I've ever seen, but it is also one of the best movies I've ever seen, period. There was not one second in this movie where i was bored or where my eyes weren't glued to the screen. Even the slow called ""slow parts"" in this movie were entertaining, and really kept you thinking. With the Joker as the villain, you never really knew what to expect or what was going to happen next. I honestly think he is one of the most unpredictable villains of all time, which just makes the movie THAT much more enjoyable and suspenseful. Speaking of the Joker, the Jokers role in this movie is EASILLY the best role as a villain in any movie I've ever seen, hands down. Heath Ledger does just an AMAZING job as the Joker, his best role ever. I think its easily an Oscar winning performance. If only he were still here with us today. Every other role in this movie was phenomenal to me, but Heaths role really stood out to me. I don't really have any complaints about this movie, it was really incredible. I movie that i feel i could see 5 more times and not have it get old. It is Two and a half hours of pure entertainment. It will make you Laugh, be shocked, scream, hell, maybe even cry. Ever actor did a phenomenal job in this movie, the action scenes were amazing, and just everything else about this movie was incredible. All in all, The Dark Knight is not only by far the best Super Hero based movie ever, but in my opinion it is one of the Best movies ever, period. It made me not wanting the movie to end. You really owe it to yourself to go see this movie. Everyone in the the theater was on their feet clapping at the end of the movie. I almost never do this, but the Dark Knight is just amazing in every way, therefore I am giving it a perfect rating. Rating: 10/10",positive,10,tt0468569
"This movie is all kinds of cheap, dumb, corny, cheesy, etc. And I love it. Why are people so hard on this movie, it's so funny. The shockingly low IMDb score of 4.3/10 (at the time of this review) proves that people aren't cultured. I am slightly biased since I saw this as a kid with no knowledge of the old show, and now I love the old show and this movie. It's obvious that the people who made this movie were fans of the original and tried to capture the spirit and tone, which I think they did. The CGI does kind of look cheap and dated sometimes, but, for what it's trying to do, it's acceptable. I think this movie would resonate with people's modern ironic and meta sense of humor.",negative,3,tt0131704
"Temet Nosce A quick break from Spider-Man because The Matrix is in my local theater. It's weird how even though I knew the plot, this movie just became significantly better and refreshing after rewatch. The concept is endlessly fascinating and entertaining. Throughout the runtime, I still had to remind myself what's real and what's not, because it's not an easy thing to accept. The characters were so badass in those shiny suits and glasses. The calming, mysterious way they talked and the cool dialogues just drawn me into the movie even more. Then, the action scenes were just as entertaining with amazing kung-fu techniques. A very minor problem was the twist and romance at the end, which felt a little cheesy. Overall, loved everything about The Matrix. 9.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0133093
"A couple of 'bests' for this film; the best King adaptation ahead of Misery and Stand by Me, and in the conversation for one of the best films of all time. Shawshank has stood the test of time since the sacrilegious Oscars debacle of 1995. Two films should have beaten Forrest and it is line ball between Pulp Fiction and Andy Dufresne's epic prison sentence. Robbins and Freeman have never been better as Andy and Red, whose non-sexual love story is the unique difference that sets the film apart from the usual prison movie cliches. It can be hokey, too long by 30 minutes, and perhaps even a bit preachy. But it is incredibly well made, and very entertaining. 9/10.",positive,9,tt0111161
"""Rule number 1 of Fight Club: You do not talk about Fight Club."" Satirical, entertaining, bold, challenging and heavily stylized. Usually if a film has one of these qualities it is a good accomplishment. But David Fincher' acclaimed Fight Club (1999) has all of them, thereby cementing its status as upcoming cult in cinema. This is an important film that bravely plunges into the exploration of human issues like violence and depression, and that does so with flair and fury. It also sprinkles good doses of humour onto its final product, making Fight Club an enjoyable ride. Edward Norton is a thirty year old office worker, lazily frozen in a comatose state of ordering IKEA furniture and getting hounded by his boss. What takes him and shakes him is the arrival of Tyler Duren (Brad Pitt) who introduces him to a subculture of anarchy and a club called 'Fight Club'. Fight Club is an extremely graphic, violent and blunt portrayal of society and it looks into human nature. While Edward Norton's character as 'The Narrator' is an extreme case study, we all recognise aspects of his life and the thoughts in his head. The only problem as far as I'm concerned are the actors. You can never get away from the 'Pitt factor' in Brad Pitt's performance and it is often distracting. Edward Norton's narration often feels flat and emotionless. This would have been very appropriate in the beginning of the film, but as it progresses and he begins to feel more alive, his lifeless tone drags down the quality. This wouldn't make my top 20, but it'd probably make my top 30 list. 8/10",positive,8,tt0137523
"There is one thing that I've rarely heard anyone point out about the generic list of ""BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME"". You know what they are. No matter what organization or website lists them, the list is almost always the same. And the one thing that the supposed elite movies of all time share in common: As far as story, they're all average. Not a single one of them has even a single scene of outstanding originality, or even flirts with it, for that matter. They're all generic paint-by-the-number dramas filled with pretty moving pictures and filled with people who can pretend to be someone else fairly well. But as far as story goes, these movies are all empty. There are a few exceptions—Star Wars, Pulp Fiction, a couple others—but that is a standard rule. The obsession with unoriginality that the pretentious men and women who chose what films are the best has always bothered me. And what better illustrates this than The Godfather? It is nothing but a generic crime drama, yet it's considered one of the greatest movies of all time? Something just seems wrong with that. Something seems wrong with the idea that the men who truly stand up and make original cinema get pushed to hell by critics, while a generic crime movie sits on the throne of God. Perhaps the perfect-scored reviews of The Godfather are right. On a technical level, on a storytelling level, on an acting level, The Godfather is perfection. The directing and production value so far surpasses everything from the early 70s, it's almost unbelievable. The storytelling is done flawlessly. I cannot think of a single 70s film where every single kill has so much value and weight. The acting is the stuff of legends. I will give The Godfather all of this credit, because it earns it. But . . . But none of that dismisses the fact that it is still simply a generic crime drama. No matter how well-done this story is told, it's a story that you've heard long before it was released. Unlike the modern gangster cinema, such as Ichi the Killer or Reservoir Dogs, The Godfather offers nothing new, even for its time. I understand that those examples I just listed are both meant to be taken as over-the-top and unrealistic, but my point still stands. People have created far more original and entertaining crime dramas than The Godfather. There is one subplot that I give this film some creative credit for—the horse—but beside that, this is just copy/paste plotting. If they had used the creativity of this scene more often throughout the movie, this truly would deserve the over-hyped credit it gets. Just because something is realistic does not mean it has to be unoriginal. Personally, I am Italian, and I have heard hundreds of real-life mob stories from my cousins, and they're all infinitely more interesting/creative than anything this film even touched. There is no excuse for The Godfather being as dry as it is. Some will argue that The Godfather is meant to be a drama about family life, not a thriller about crime. If that is true, and it may hold some truth, then The Godfather excels. Somewhat. As far as realistic emotion of family life, it's pretty solid and mildly cliché-defying. But it's nothing you haven't seen before, and seen with more compelling presentation. The other major flaw that is inevitable to ignore is the pure boredom that sets in every thirty minutes. I've read reviews stating that this modern generation simply can't relate to gangster films, thus it's boring. I've read reviews stating that the plot is generic, thus it's boring. Etc., etc., etc. All these may be valid reasons, but I think the point is this: The Godfather IS boring. It's filled with pointless conversation scenes that add nothing to the overall film or the generic plot or the drama, so what's the point of even including them? Pretentious-minded reviewers say that the viewer needs to be patient . . . Patient for what? Unlike Ridley Scott's Alien, there is rarely any payoff after the endless buildup in The Godfather. There is no entertainment value. While I'm completely fine with a film lacking entertainment value in order to show honest desperation or to intentionally offend, The Godfather does neither. All the reviews stating that this is a violent movie can be ignored. There is far more graphic violence in PG- and PG-13-rated movies of the past two years than this. With all the valid flaws I just listed, anyone calling this movie absolutely flawless is in denial. Or just has extremely low standards. While The Godfather is compelling and has masterful plotting and directing, it is simply just another face in the unoriginal crowd when you look at the big picture. Perhaps it was very influential in cinema—why should that effect how you personally view the film? Just because pretentious ""film buffs"" claim it's flawless, can you really not think of a single film that you enjoyed more? ""CLASSIC"" is just a word slapped onto films that critics are brainwashed into appreciating. It has no bearing on the true artistic or emotional value. It really shouldn't even have any bearing on public opinion, but it does. Imagine with me a world where The Godfather had been critically hated. Do you really think it would still receive the high public ratings that it has now? I highly doubt it. No one makes up their own mind anymore; anyone who does is considered a mindless shock jock, no matter how valid their reasoning is. While the best reasoning I have read for why The Godfather—other than the generic ""good plot, good acting, etc.""—is considered so great is, ""BECAUSE IT IS. SHUT UP."" Maybe what they're really trying to say is, ""I have no idea why it's good, I've just been told so, and I forced myself to believe it."" 4/10",negative,4,tt0068646

"I have seen this twice now, the first time was shortly after it's release. I thought highly of it when first released, Edward Norton was convincing in his role and the gritty violence portrayed in the film left an impression with me. Having seen it again and cast a far more critical eye upon it I would find it difficult to give it much more than a 6/10. The acting is above par but the story seems poor paced and the characters shallow. The basketball scene was one that I really didn't appreciate. Norton is elbowed early on by a black player (can you really blame him after Norton proudly displays his swastika tattoo), this is supposedly to make him the victim/hero of the scene. The crass triumphal music is supposed to raise us up with him as he and his white supremacist stooges triumph over the local 'monkeys'. Awful.

Let me start with the acting, Heath ledger... everything has already been said about this performance, yet he still managed to surprise me, what a performance, hat's off, he really does get under your skin, created (togather with writers of course) the perfect joker, or at least the one i wanted to see, dark, psychotic and a maniac. Aaron Arkhat (or however you spell his name) also gave a strong performance as Hearvy Dent, and the other cast was pretty solid. The script is just great... this is truly one of the best films if not the best that portrait the battle between good and evil, between what right and wrong, and about making the right choices. Now, retrospectively, i am really disappointed with the trailers for this movie, they composed different sentences to give it a more intense feeling and gave a lot of the action in the movie... sure they were great, but also gives you high expectations for this movie... and i hate coming to a movie with high expectations, so a little let down in that aspect. and yes 2 hours and a half did feel a bit long. That been said, TDK is a fantastic movie (sure it has some flaws, but what movie doesn't) its well written, directed and acted, action packed and even epic in a way only time will make it.

"From the moment the narrator slobbers on Bob's tits I just knew there was going to be something very special about this movie. This movie quite simply embodies everything that a movie is supposed to be. A 2h roller coaster ride of thoughts and emotions. It can quite rightly be regarded as the first movie of the 21st century. To put it simply: This movie is the most intense thing I have ever seen. The idea of the movie seems simple, and if you watch the commercials it will re soundly have the appearance of a conventional film. An ordinary and, more importantly, nameless guy (who narrates the entire film) meets a non-conformist and quite insane Tyler Durden. ""Now let me tell you something about Tyler"". He does night jobs. He works as a waiter at galla dinners and pees in the soup, subsequently suing the catering companies. He works as a projector and splices short, but definitely noticeable, porno clips into children's movies. Last but definitely not least, he scrounges the dumpsters at liposuction clinics for bags of fat, makes soap out of it, and ""sells [the rich ladies] their own fat asses back for a profit"". Out of this soap, he also makes explosives. After having his house blown away for at that point undetermined reasons, the narrator turns to Tyler for a place to stay, which turns out to be one of those wrecks even poverty-stricken squatters would stay away from and in the middle of nowhere. Little by little, Tyler lures the narrator into his ways and makes him question his entire reality. By defining himself through his job and what he buys, he has lost touch with his inner self and his true emotions of loneliness and helplessness. Tyler's solution is to stop trying to control things, to hold on to things one does not need, to be perfect. Tyler's answer is to ""let the chips fly"". To do things just for the heck of it, including experiencing pain. Only when one can loose everything one does not need is one free to go after what truly matters. The entire progression of just how far one can go is evident in the movie. Tyler first cajoles the narrator into having a fight with him with the following words: ""I've never been in a fight either. There is no one watching. Come on, how much can you truly know about yourself if you've never been into a fight"". This duking out turns out to be a pleasurable experience and becomes a regular event. Before you know it, other guys join the fray and the ultimate release in the form of senselessly beating another man and in turn being beaten is institutionalized in the form of ""Fight Club"", lead by Tyler and the narrator. Evidently this movie reeks of testosterone and raw, violent male energy and the movie is unapologetic in this respect to the very end. In some ways ""Fight Club"" is about rediscovering ones masculinity, a force quite vilified and suppressed in recent decades. Converts to ""Fight Club"" include former members of the ""Remaining Men Together"", a club of testicular cancer sufferers, mostly abandoned by their wives now having children with other men, who before ""Fight Club"" knew of nothing better than to cry on each others shoulders (literally) and pathetically embrace each other. Hilariously, one of the key characters and ex-members of this group, played by Meatloaf, is aptly equipped with huge titties. That ""Fight Club"" transforms everyone in it is evident, especially on the narrator, who is no longer content to tolerate the cr** one routinely gets served with in wage-slaving office jobs. He ultimately blackmails his boss into giving him ""a job never to tell anyone"" about the dirty dealings in the company. To seal the deal, the narrator starts ""fighting"" himself and is so violently battered by the time security arrives that his boss has no chance but to comply. In any case, the number of ""Fight Club"" members grows. And they all start listening to what Tyler has to say. Tyler's influence on this large band of people from all walks of life slowly grows and culminates in the so-called ""Project Mayhem"". Rather than being freed, they end up being made instruments of Tyler's will. The narrator is of course mostly kept out of the loop and must find out what is going on before its too late! And then something unexpected happens. And the REAL fun starts! Suffices to say that Fight Club packs more story and ideas than ten times what most movies do. The ideas truly resonated with me. The energy of the movie is at a fever pitch. The violence is gritty and its underlying purposelessness makes it that much more intense. Tyler's charm and charisma are awe-inspiring. Truly all the actors do a superb job. In terms of visually conveying all the ideas, Fight Club is unparalleled. Since the entire movie is narrated, we experience wild and sometimes outrageous cuts between different scenes and time frames. More so, we are treated with astounding visuals, close-ups, slow motion scenes, featuring in one case an explosion happening in slow motion. In line with the ""splicing of porno movies into children's films"", many interesting ""splices"" occur through out the movie itself. The effects are given a gritty 90s-00s feel. Yet they are there only to consistently prop up the story and elevate it to a new high. In short, in terms of visual innovation and effects this is probably the most innovative movie since Annie Hall. What can I say, this movie will undoubtedly be talked about for centuries to come and be the mark of a ""very strange time"" in the life of humanity. 10/10 SCALE: positive opinion of a movie: 10 MASTERPIECE, 9 Excellent, 8 Good, 7 OK neutral opinion of a movie: 6 Adequate, 5 Fair, 4 Mediocre negative opinion of a movie: 3 Poor, 2 Bad, 1 HORRIBLE",positive,10,tt0137523
"I think I watched the same film as all the others on here that disliked it. I enjoyed the cinematography and the effects but there is really nothing else about this film I can say I liked. I think Matthew McConaughey is a great character actor but in this film he just didn't fit, for me. His voice, stance, mannerisms all seem out of place. Like he just didn't care and wanted the paycheck. Not that all the blame for the bad film can be put on his shoulders. The rest of the cast, all but a small few of them, just weren't entertaining. From the maker of Inception I expected more. What I got was nearly 3 hrs of not a very good film. 3/10 for the visuals. That's all I got. Disappointed.",negative,3,tt0816692
"The actors, the script, the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best-played character of the joker is amazing. That's how I imagined him. In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well. Therefore, my rating for this movie is 10/10.",positive,10,tt0468569

"I really don't understand the negativity on this movie It is not going to win any Oscars but people need to approach it for what it is. It is a series of short sketches, comedy. There is no real linking of the sketches despite trying to link them in with a movie theme.. You need to appreciate the individual sketches. I'll admit not all of the sketches work but at least 70% do. I found the movie , overall hilarious and well worth watching. Yes the sketches are crude and gross humor but if you know this how can you then be offended. I can not understand half the reviews when if you know what the movie is why would you watch it if this sort of thing doesn't appeal? Well worth it and 7.5/10",neutral,5,tt1333125
"The Godfather is written & directed by Francis Ford Coppola and stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall and Richard Conte. The ageing patriarch of an organised crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son. Whenever you get into a discussion with someone about filmmaking or ask about their favourite movies of all time, at some point they will mention The Godfather. There's a very simple explanation for this, and it's something to be discovered when experiencing the movie for yourself. It's very clear how incredibly well written this movie is, from the first scene, to the last. Not only the writing, but the magnetic performances throughout are consistently showcased against a backdrop of New York from 1945-1955. One of the reasons this movie is so beautiful is because of how realistic it is. Although we can't say we've been a part of an empire like featured in the movie, we can all relate to the characters. It's a dark and tragic story. The acting as aforementioned is phenomenal. Brando is vitally important in his convincing portrayal of Don Vito Corleone. As is Al Pacino as he gradually becomes the front-man during the movie's running-length. Caan has a heart-breaking turn in his character's arc, and he performs wonderfully. The same for Duvall, Conte and everyone else not mentioned. The list is too long to name each individual, but they don't go unnoticed. Although this is a long movie, there's so much going on and in such intricate detail that the time effortlessly drifts by. Every character has a chance to transform within the time-frame. Don't be put off by the duration. Many filmmakers these days are afraid of making their work too long, but if done correctly, it can be a tremendous piece of art. This movie is a fine example of that fact. The original score by Nino Rota is one of the most recognised soundtracks of all time, and respectfully so. There are moments where his music is used greatly, and moments where it isn't used at all. While this happens the music is changing also. It's the perfect sound for such a story, and pairs with the picture brilliantly. Verdict; The Godfather is widely regarded as a masterpiece. One of the greatest movies of our time. I can fully agree with these statements and add that in its many years since release, it hasn't aged a bit. If you haven't yet experienced The Godfather, please do yourself a favour. With so much greatness in front of you, it's an offer you can't refuse. The Godfather, 10/10.",positive,10,tt0068646
"Personal/Plot: (What film was about/enjoyability?)
I enjoyed this film despite the horrors shown on screen. The film depicts the 6 year struggle that jews in Krakow, Poland endured under Nazi rule. 2/2 Aesthetic/Cinematography: (How film was made?) Whenever I watch a black and white film, I always find it being beautiful. The reason being is because you can play around with gray color gradients and even, as seen with the little girl in red, throw in some color that catches your eye and keeps its attention. 2/2 Spiritual/Ending: (Beauty of film/inspire towards the transcendent) Spielberg threw the duality of Amon and Oskar in my face as soon as Amon stepped on screen. You can look at attitude during dinners, general hygiene, kindness, love towards others, etc. If you watch the movie, you don't need me to explain how Spielberg brilliantly contrasts the two individuals and how they exist in a time full of death. Another aspect that I thought was beautifully executed was schindlers development from being an industrialist set on profit to a man who understands/acts for jews in a time of persecution. Gives me hope that at any time in human history, regardless of the pressures and evils in power, people can still have the ability to be good. I also audible gasped at different points during the film when I saw how Jews were forced to do nasty things to survive (the toilet scene with the kid). 2/2 Acting: (Can I do it better?) Honestly, Liam Neeson went crazy in this movie. From the very beginning he did an excellent job of portraying a classy and likeable industrialist. His acting was great the enitre movie, but the 1 more scene at the end was his peak in terms of acting. However, Ralph Fiennes played an amazing antagonist the entire time, and should get an award for his acting. 2/2 Score/Music: (Goosebumps/complement scenes?) Great music. 1/1 Recommend/Rewatch: I would recommend this, but I would not rewatch as it hurts your soul seeing other humans commit atrocities to each other. 0.5/1 Pacing: (Bearable?) Despite this being a 3 hour long movie, it wasn't intolerable, but it wasn't easy. 1/1 Total: 9.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0108052
"This is first and foremost a fun space western. In that right, it succeeds. It is not completely Star Wars. It tries to be, giving us a different side of the universe, but it feels like Star Wars mixed with Valerian. The performances were decent. It takes a bit for you to accept Eichenrach as Solo but by the end, you can totally see it. Woody Harrelson was a fine guy to see, he's been getting better. Emilia Clarke was fairly good. The standout is, of course, Donald Glover as Lando. He's exactly what a young Lando would and should be. The writing was probably my biggest disappointment. If you know me, you know I love writing. I'm okay with this writing, but there wasn't anything too great. It didn't do anything you didn't expect, which was probably my main problem. The direction was uneven, no surprise. It's not their fault, really. There was a director shake up halfway through production. Kinda amazing how decent it was given all the behind the scenes drama. It's not anything special. 6/10.",neutral,6,tt3778644
"Good film. Hot on Frank's heals is the smart, but often mistaken, FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). While trying to reconnect his parent's lost marriage, Frank finds something he isn't looking for in Brenda Strong (Amy Adams). The two hit it off and quickly fall in love. A reoccurring color and lighting motif appears in the meeting of Frank and Brenda and suggests the possible downfall of Frank's new life. (It's always a girl.) Director Steven Spielberg manipulates lighting and color to show the glamorous lifestyle of a pilot, doctor, and lawyer, all careers Frank cons his way into. The contrast to the brightness of the glamorous appears in a drab, dark palette when young Frank's life isn't heading where he would like. Like Max in Where the Wild Things Are, Frank creates a new world for himself in order to deal with what is taking place at home. DiCaprio does a phenomenal job of creating empathy from the audience for his character. Although Frank is breaking the law, it is hard not to root for him. 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0264464
"Well I'm 15 and saw this movie for the first time recently. I must say although it was well acted, written and directed; it was somewhat boring during some portions of the movie, and there were some points where i couldn't figure out what was going or why it was going on. This was sometimes caused by Brando's almost unintelligible mumbled accent (my only gripe with the acting). It seems like there was just a classic scene, then some boring filler, another memorable scene, then boring filler, and so on. All in all it's a good movie and worth watching. 7/10 definitely a classic, just don't expect and edge of your seat action flick.",positive,7,tt0068646

Sure it's revolutionary at the time it came out for the first time, but really if you watch it right now there is actually quite a lot of flaws in the movie, from the goofy and silliness, an unsatisfied and weird death, but an amazing visual design, creature, set, John Williams incredible score, the fun that all the actor do, and so do the audience watching it and at least for me mostly, it's still a pretty good movie overall.",neutral,5,tt0076759
"I don't often hand out high ranks to found footage movies unless I really was impressed and to say I am impressed is an understatement. This film is nothing short of a treat to horror audiences everywhere I'm going to briefly review each title with 0 spoilers, a quick synopsis, and why it was good or bad. Tape 47: This is the generalized tape that leads the investigators to the house, They're searching for a boy gone missing. I thought it was a much needed improvement over the first generalized tape in V/H/S. I'll leave it at that and say that the end result of their journey to this house leaves the audience to decide what happened Clinical Trials: 7.5/10 This is about a man who gets a cybernetic eye attached to his eye but its on a trial period because it is new technology. He begins to experience strange hallucinations and other weird things that happen to him. Overall this one was the weakest link of them all for me, The effects though and scares were excellent but the whole story to this one just didn't seem to fit too much. It was still highly enjoyable though. A Ride In The Park: 9.5/10 LOVED this one and probably one of my new favourite zombie shorts ever. The synopsis: A man riding his bike that becomes infected from some campers. The camera on his bike helmet slowly unfolds the chronology of what happens after he is infected and how the plague spreads. MAN if they could do this idea in a big city or something...wow it was so well executed, the effects, acting, and how it developed had me glued to the screen. Sacred Haven: 9.7/10 This was about a documentary crew that sets out to film a religious place that supposedly involves a lot of controversy. The guy that directed the segment ""L is for Libido"" in ABC's of Death did this one and that segment in that other movie was the best of the alphabet so I was amped about this one. This one probably had the strongest story of the bunch and was probably my favourite. It was scary, disturbing, yet insanely intense at the same time. As this one unfolds it gets quite unsettling very fast Slumber Party Alien Abduction: 8/10 Well the synopsis for this one is pretty much in the title. I felt like they could have approached this one in a different manner but it still really impressed me. You'll get a few chuckles out of the story in the beginning in this one. You'll also get a few hints along the way before the storm hits that something very bad is going to happen. This one felt really disturbing at the end but it was extremely well done. My only qualms with it was I felt that they shouldn't have jumped to the action so quickly and built it up more gradually instead. STILL very good though Final Thoughts: This film is a huge tribute to horror fans everywhere and is top notch quality. I really hope this film takes off and more people see it because it is just too good not to see in my opinion, ESPECIALLY if you love horror and hand held footage. I feel extremely satisfied and very grateful that the directors made this piece of artwork for us to all enjoy.",neutral,5,tt2450186

"I'm not a gamer guy, nor am I what you would call a comic book geek either. It's these two facts that let me enter into the film adaptations of said topics with absolutely no frame of reference what so ever. Something that has at times given me some fun no-brain entertainment. So when, some seven years after its release, I announce to my friends that I bought Doom for a pound (dollar) to watch for the first time, the derision was high and the overriding message was that even at one pound I had been robbed! To be fair, the omens wasn't great since I hated Tomb Raider, Silent Hill and Mortal Kombat with a passion. But this has The Rock, Karl Urban and the delectable Rosamund Pike in it, enough there for me to part with a shiny one pound coin. Well I'm pleased to report that Miss Pike is still delectable, but that's about it. Well actually it isn't totally dreadful, a daring run of character development by director Andrzej Bartkowiak leads off the film, plot is kick started and we are on a Mars facility in the future and something monstrous is on the loose. Then it's an Aliens lite adventure as The Rock and his macho beefcake chums wander around this dimly lit research centre trying to kill or not be killed. Throw in as many clichés as you can muster, loads of corny dialogue and some bad acting, and there you have it, yet another soulless video game adaptation to the screen. OK, there's the odd perky effect and a good set piece, whilst the nod to the first person shooter is more homage than corn, but really this is hard to recommend to anyone after a half decent monster stalker of a movie. Think I might have to start playing these games instead. 4/10",negative,4,tt0419706

With its open and difficult but still so realistic conversations as well as the masterful performances by the actors, I must say I understand why it's the top rated movie on IMDb. You feel the exact emotions the movie wants you to feel from the weird feeling of liking of a condemned murderer up until the end where i must say the movie got a tear from me, what is quite unusual for me. This movie gets you and is already on my list of my all time favorites, as I continue to think about everything happening in the movie over all this time and how those characters developed an amazing synergy that makes you as the viewer constantly hope for them, feel the pain for their dying comrades and be happy when they have a nice moment. Over all I must say it's a perfect movie, that I would have to watch quit a lot more to find mistakes and only if I were really looking for some, but since I hate looking for something wrong I like to focus on the good things and this movie has an uncountable amount of these. -> 10/10 Perfektion!!!",positive,10,tt0111161

Schindler's List captures the true essence of our horrible past, and elaborates on a true story that saved countless lives of those who worked for Oskar Schindler. The use of the film being shot in black and white really adds to the message that this movie gives you.

"Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) is a movie that I watched for the first time in a long time on Disney+. The storyline follows Hans, an orphaned boy finding his way during an emerging revolution. As he executes a heist and is on his way to escaping with his girlfriend, she is captured. He will look for ways to secure the funds he needs to acquire a ship to return to his home planet and save his girl. He will meet various friends along the way to help him in his journey. This movie is directed by icon Ron Howard (Willow) and stars Alden Ehrenreich (Tetro), Woody Harrelson (CHEERS), Donald Glover (Atlanta), Thandiwe Newton (Westworld), Emilia Clarke (Game of Thrones) and Jon Favreau (Iron Man). The universe this picture takes place in is really well depicted and captures the imagination. The cast is impressive and perfectly selected, outside of Hans who I think could have been more compelling and charming. The writing is clever with great dialogue and entertaining circumstances. The androids and aliens are a lot of fun, as always. The storyline did not pull me in as much as I hoped and the villain was just okay. The shootouts and fight scenes are out of this world and make up for the lack of a worthwhile plot. The background music felt like classic Star Wars and provides the right feel throughout the movie. Overall, this is amongst the worst Star Wars movies ever made but is still entertaining and worth a viewing. I would score this a 6.5/10 and recommend seeing it once.",neutral,5,tt3778644
"Fight Club  8/10 I had read the book before I saw the film. The book was very interesting but I can say I will not be a fan of this type of literature. David Fincher had good idea shooting a film from this book. The plot of the film followed the book's, and the view was good. But I have enough fantasy to imagine that is written in the book. I was shocked by each page of the book, yet I went on reading. The view of the film was not so frightened as I expected (I was thinking if I wanted to see this movie while I was reading the book), and there was a few things missed from the film. So the atmosphere, message of the book was not let in to the light during the film well. But I think the film can impress on somebody: somebody stand up and leave the movietheatre, somebody think about it. The cast was good. Edward Norton is one of my favourite actor, he did a perfect job here too.He is not muscular, but the force is with him.  He has charisma. I think the reason why Brad Pitt  wanted to do this film that he always wants audience not to see him like a nice guy. He did OK job, but for me he will never be Edward Norton. Yet I gave seven point to this film, because it is not an average action film, it has got a deeper message, can made people think, and cast was good. I think it is worth seeing, but I wouldn't recommend it to my parents.",positive,8,tt0137523
"When I started watching this seemingly endless drag of a movie, I was expecting some of the magic that this franchise has had in the past. It wasn't to be. Instead, we got familiar character after familiar character, each doing their characteristic throw-away joke. No drama was involved; at no time did I ever think any of the far-too-many stars that were involved were in any danger, or that anything bad could happen; it was all slight-of-hand, all CGI trickery that looks impressive when there's just a bit of it. Here were great heaping glops of it. Acting? None that I could discern, it was all throw-away lines from throw-away characters. These cardboard characters looked better on the cardboard box! At first I thought of giving this piece of garbage a score of 2/10; but really, this movie is so very bad, and so damaging to the franchise, that a 1/10 is well deserved. It would be lower if I could make it so. This is a throw-away movie. Very young children and the extremely easily impressed by green-screen effects may like this film, but don't look for a plot or story; it's got lots of familiar faces though. It would have done so much better if it had a decent script-writer! Alas, that was not deemed necessary.",negative,2,tt4154756

Morgan Freeman gave a stellar performance, arguably his best also, as Red, Andy's cell mate another character you grow to love during this wonderful piece of cinema. This is a film i will never tire of, if you haven't watched it for whatever reason, you should do! A solid 10/10 for me! enjoy.",positive,10,tt0111161
"No, this is not a remake of Raymond Briggs's well-loved Christmas tale. This ""The Snowman"" is a piece of what has become known as ""Nordic Noir"". Although the Scandinavian countries have long enjoyed a reputation for being peaceful societies with a relatively low crime rate, they have also in recent years, at least in the English-speaking world, also acquired a reputation for their crime fiction. The Swedish writer Stieg Larsson's ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" was made into an excellent English-language film in 2011. (There was also a Swedish-language version which I have never seen). ""The Snowman"" attempts to repeat the success of the earlier film by adapting a novel by the Norwegian writer Jo Nesbø. The lead character is the detective Harry Hole. Hole is pursuing a serial killer nicknamed ""The Snowman"" from his habit of building a snowman near the scene of each of his crimes. Each killing takes place just after the first snows of winter. I won't set out any more of the plot than that, because for much of its length the story is well-nigh incomprehensible, although some sort of meaning becomes apparent towards the end. That's not just my opinion, it seems to be the opinion of most of the critics as well. Although the film is a fairly lengthy one, it was, apparently, supposed to be even longer. According to the director Tomas Alfredson, the filming schedule was too short which meant that large chunks of the screenplay could not be shot, with the result that what actually was shot does not hang together or make a good deal of sense. What's the Norwegian for ""Alan Smithee""? The best thing about the film is Alfredson's moody, atmospheric photography of the Norwegian winter landscapes and townscapes, reminiscent of those in another, much better, neo-noir set in northern Europe, Alan Pakula's ""Gorky Park"" from the early eighties. Overall, however, the film is a waste of time and of all the talents involved, including such well-known actors (some of them employed in surprisingly minor roles) as Michael Fassbender, Rebecca Ferguson, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Val Kilmer, Chloë Sevigny and Toby Jones. 3/10",negative,3,tt1758810

Pros- visually this puppy is stunning, the world is inspiring but familiar. The sound design is well done. Cons- the voice acting is very all over the place, some ok performances, but many just don't fit. The pacing is not very good either. The characters are too one note or two note. Overall this is kind of a bland movie going experience. It's an immigration tale of foreigners making it in a new city and dealing with the prejudices of being different, very Zootopia, but unlike that very charming tale, this movie just drags and the characters are very bland. The fire dad might be the most intriguing character but by far the biggest offender is Wade Ripple, the water boy, they just shove him on you and try very hard to make you like him and the chemistry between Ember and him is so contrived. Also there is no really good side characters for them to play off of. Kind of a waste in my opinion. It's a film that's pretty forgettable in the end. 4/10.",negative,4,tt15789038

There was something weird about this film. When I read about it I thought 'Oh,they included GoPro - it's gonna add a realistic touch' - but it didn't. The whole movie was very played out and did not give me the chills that the first one did. The trailer,the snapshots,the reviews made me think it was 2013's best movie candidate - but it wasn't. Let's review it segment by segment shall we? Tape 49 - Tape 49 was really creepy. Possibly,the only reason why I give this movie 4/10. It was really creepy and the ending was - oh my god. Best I have ever seen. Give this segment 9/10. Phase I Clinical Trial - S***. I don't wanna discuss this movie or the bad acting at it or the unrealistic plot that just messed up the movie because I'll get very mad. Give this segment 2/10 just because the sex scene. A Ride In The Park - Awesome plot but terrible acting. Give this segment 4/10. Safe Heaven - This was my favorite segment out of them all.

It's not easy to review this movie, it's like a big puzzle which screen-players turned it into a big mess. It alternates some visually strong scenes, to some absolutely cheap ones. The dialogues: 3/10 were brilliant, the rest were almost senseless and useless; the movie reaches some high emotive peaks, but again, I'm not fully convinced: they wanted to make audience cry, it tastes like a cheap trick. Matthew McCounaghey is fabulous, as always. The rest of the cast is under expectations. Michael Caine, C. Affleck, A. Hathaway, Jessica Chastain.

"Seven years later and after two exceptional films The Dark Knight(2008), and The Dark Knight Rises(2012) I still stand behind my belief that Batman Begins is quite simply the best superhero film of all time. It had it all-- a exceptional cast, a great story, and finally for once told the story of Bruce Wayne. Everything from the action scenes, to the pacing, the dialogue, and sense of humor just made the film one of my favorites throughout the years, and Christian Bale's performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman finally had depth to such a complex character. Fans including myself, finally portrayed a realistic Bruce Wayne, a side you never seen in the previous film. Bruce is supposed to be a troubled soul, a playboy, and of course his alter-ego Batman. It was satisfying to also see Michael Caine as Alfred who gave a great performance in the role, where during Burton/Schumacher series their wasn't much of a relationship between Bruce and his trusted butler. Their was a emotional connection that I felt was important and added character to Alfred and Bruce. The rest of the cast was exceptional as Gary Oldman as James Gordon, who also developed a relationship with Batman, a relationship I felt important to the film series. Morgan Freeman as Lucius was a great addition because you have to wonder where he get's all these cool toys, and for once it is believable. Liam Neeson was great as well, and his character fit so well into the plot. I couldn't imagine anybody else playing Henri Ducard as well as Neeson. The only thing lacking in my opinion was The Scarecrow played by Jonathon Crane who's hallucinogen played a vital role in the plot, as well as Katie Holmes character of Rachel Dawes left a bit of a sour taste in your mouth. Regardless this movie had great action scenes, although some of the fight scenes are too fast, and the camera angles we're horrendous on some of those scenes. The Tumbler scene is still in my honest opinion the best action scene in all of the trilogy. Finally the Batman franchise was given a respectable movie-- darker, grittier, and more realistic. A believable world brought to life by Christopher Nolan. 9.2/10",negative,2,tt0372784

"The one thing I'd like to take into consideration while writing this review is the fact I've only seen this film once so maybe I didn't fully understand it, but when i did watch it I wasn't its biggest fan. Don't get me wrong, it's a great movie, the entire setup for the end of the movie is great, I love the script for it and I think Edward Norton and Brad pitt play their roles to perfection. Now i know this isn't necessarily finchers fault because this movie is based off a book but a common problem i seem to have with fincher movies is the fact that I love the movie itself but don't like the ending, this movie was No difference. I think the ending opened up a lot more questions and honesty was kinda silly and didn't completely makes sense. But hey, what do I know? 8.6/10.",neutral,6,tt0137523
"Let me start by saying I knew from the opening minutes of the movie what they were trying to do, what kind of story they were trying to tell. But I also knew from the very same moment they were probably going to fail miserably at it, and they did. This is the story of a single mother, who refuses to believe the love of her life, the man that was there when she needed him could potentially be a serial killer. This is not a bad plot, and it could have actually worked if her perfect boyfriend was not Ted Bundy. And I realize that the story is told from her perspective, but there is no suspension of disbelief when it comes to one of America's more prolific serial killers. The film also tries its best to make the audience see Bundy from her eyes, but it no easy task for the reasons I have already mentioned. This formula has worked before in other movies, but it did not work in this one, and I think that casting Zac Efron in it was a mistake, because thou he is charming, he cannot act to save his life, he tries to fool the audience with his charisma but the audience is not that stupid nor are they naive. If this had been a movie that told or even showed his crimes it might have given resonance to what Ted Bundy's case highlighted, that the evil doers are not hiding in shadows, but they walk among us in broad day light. Yet this film wanted the audience to sympathize with Bundy and his extremely naïve girlfriend, and it failed astoundingly at that. I rate this mess a 4/10. It had a great supporting cast, and it was filmed well in a technical level. But story wise it was extremely weak, shockingly stupid and idiotic.",negative,4,tt2481498
"yes this movie is one of the greatest This movie changed my thinking about people who go to prison. I believe that everyone deserves a second chance no matter what it is. They need to be given a chance to change themselves. Morgan Freeman did justice to his role i was really touched at the end part when he's there for the parole and the words that came out of his mouth. Tim Robbins was tremendous, its the first time i noticed him as an actor and he's one of the best. prison is terrible place to be its like a whole new world and my perspective has changed about that.

"Darabonts film about an innocent banker and his troubles inside a maximum security prison with a tough warden (Gunton). Andy (robbins) befriends an inmate whose friendship gives him hope and is the backbone of the film, Morgan Freeman plays this role superbly in what i think is the actor's best performance of all time. This is Freeman's film, though Robbins is great in the lead and Gunton is a hell of an antagonist. Everything about this film is perfect, so i can completely see why its the 3rd best film of all time on IMDb.

"This movie is about as bad as I thought it would be, so at least it wasn't worse. Look, a 4/10 isn't the worst, but it's still very bad. I'm kind of familiar with the ""Doom"" game. I played a flash version of it and had tons of fun with it. This movie is mostly just a ripoff of ""Alien"" with some ""Predator"" thrown in. Well, ""Alien Vs. Predator"" had recently come out. It's just people looking for monsters in a spaceship. They even directly rip off the dialogue from ""Predator"". It's safe for me to say that this is the worst movie the Rock was ever in. Well, that I've seen at least. Two thirds into the movie, the Rock just goes insane for no reason. I guess it's fine if they change the demons to aliens. Well, actually they were genetic experiments, which is probably even less plausible. I wish the Rock could have turned more into a literal monster. The characters are mostly annoying with every guy being sexist and constantly insulting one another. Then again, there is that one great five minute scene that's directly based on the games.

"There are some strong aspects to this film, including the cinematography and the acting. But this movie is way overly complicated for no other reason than to make the viewer feel smart. The story is just a mess, and entire premise of the film feels like such a reach for this incredibly deep and complex meaning which just feels like it falls on its face. The movie isn't hard to follow, even if you're hammered. There are some scenes I enjoy but overall I would never choose to watch it again. I think Nolan is a solid director and he has some films I really enjoy, but this one just feels like he was trying so hard. 5/10.",neutral,5,tt1375666
"People put this movie on a pedestal like it's one of the greatest films of all time. 8.6/10 average user rating on IMDb, and #22 on the IMDb top 250? Come on guys, it's not THAT good. I believe this movie is held in such high regard because 1991 was a weak year for movies, and this handily won Best Picture simply by virtue of all the competition paling in comparison. It's very good, possibly great, and I can see why it was a pretty groundbreaking cinematic achievement for its time. I could see how it inspired stuff like Se7en and The Sopranos. The technical aspects and at times creative camerawork are top notch, and the grounded writing makes the world feel more palpable. Why don't I fawn over it? I think it's just because the characters feel a little detached. The whole movie is people doing their jobs, and as a result we feel like we never really get to know them. The filmmaking, though technically impressive, feels a bit cold and doesn't help immerse me in this story. It might sound like I'm having trouble putting my thoughts in writing, but Silence of The Lambs is just one of those intangible ""it just didn't do it for me"" movies. Remember when Captain America: Winter Soldier came out and everyone was hailing it as one of the best action movies of recent memory? It just didn't do it for me in the same was that film didn't. People are always shocked when I tell them it was just ""alright"" or ""pretty good"". Silence of The Lambs fills a similar space in my memory. I can enjoy it when it's on, and I appreciate what it inspired, but I feel there's many other movies that do this sort of serial killer procedural a lot better. 7.6/10.

I sat through this movie for almost 3 hrs just wondering when it was going to pick up its momentum - well it never came. What a big letdown?

"Martin Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a cinematic exploration of the seductive power of excess and the intoxicating allure of wealth. This film, sitting at a solid 8.3/10, offers a window into the life of Jordan Belfort, played with captivating intensity by Leonardo DiCaprio, as he navigates the tumultuous world of high finance. From a narrative standpoint, the film is a whirlwind of humor, drama, and the occasional brush with the absurd, perfectly encapsulating the chaotic essence of Belfort's real-life escapades. Scorsese's storytelling is linear yet dynamic, allowing audiences to ride alongside Belfort's meteoric rise and fall without losing track of the underlying themes of greed, corruption, and moral decay. Technically, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a showcase of Scorsese's filmmaking prowess. The movie's vibrant cinematography and fluid camera work mirror the frenetic energy of its protagonist's life, creating a visually stunning tableau that is both exhilarating and disorienting. The carefully curated soundtrack further elevates the film, with a blend of contemporary and classic tracks that underscore the narrative's pivotal moments. The performances in this film are nothing short of stellar. DiCaprio, in particular, delivers a tour-de-force portrayal of Belfort, masterfully capturing the character's charm and moral ambiguity. The supporting cast, including Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie, add layers of complexity and humanity to the story, enriching the film's exploration of its themes. On a personal note, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" resonates as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked ambition and the corrupting influence of power. The film, while often humorous and entertaining, also prompts deeper reflection on the nature of success and the ethical boundaries crossed in its pursuit. In conclusion, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a bold and unflinching look at a controversial figure's life. While it may not delve deeply into the broader socio-economic implications of Belfort's actions, it succeeds in providing an engaging, thought-provoking, and occasionally humorous glimpse into a seldom-seen world. It stands as a testament to Scorsese's ability to craft compelling narratives about complex characters and is a must-watch for fans of his work and those intrigued by the darker aspects of the American dream.",negative,3,tt0993846

It was totally original at it's time and today, it is filled with great performances that set up wonderful careers, and it is overflowing with drama, romance, mystery, intrigue, action, and tragedy. This epic follows the Corleone family's trials and tribulations in New York and Italy. Vito is the don, Michael, Fredo, and Sonny are his three sons and Tom is his consigliere. This is my favorite of the GF movies. My favorite character is Sonny played by James Caan. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and the late John Cazale are all excellent.

"Solo is the latest addition to what I'm increasingly calling the ""Star Bores"" stable of film flops. Like many of the other recent additions Solo simply lacks the ingredients that made some but not all, of the original films so endearing. The characterisation of Han Solo is missing much of the swagger and devil may care charm and wit of the original. This problem is aggravated by a weak back story that has Han growing up in a sci fi version of a Dickensian dock land.Poor Han is raised, if that's the right word, by a weird criminal underworld Fagin-esque muppet like creature, that lives in a pond and has a vampire's aversion to sunlight. If that sounds stupid and illogical, you are in good company. Things don't improve as the story progresses either. There's a series of peculiar and inexplicable events that eventually brings Han into contact with his walking rug side-kick Chewbacca. This in turn sets the stage, in unconvincing style, for his transformation into rogue smuggler with a heart. On the upside the special effects are mostly decent and the action scenes well done, if predictable. That said, none of this is enough to save Solo, for me at least, from applying the label of ""mediocre"". 5/10 from me.",neutral,5,tt3778644
"Like many of the reviewers, I hate prison movies with all the clichés and stereotypes of innocent prisoners, nasty guards, and evil wardens; and upon first viewing, many years ago, I especially disliked being forced by this film to feel sympathy and empathy with murderers, rapists and the like. Shawshank has somehow transcended the test of time; and I believe that it has endured, not because of the great performances (which don't seem to be acting at all, but real), not because of the simple, but multi-level, story line with its twists and turns, not because of its magnificent photography, not because of its score, and not because of any individual element that went into the making of this film. (Hence, the lack of academy awards.) However, when all those elements are combined, Shawshank becomes one of those masterpieces which is greater than the sum of its parts...and this film is so much greater that in the desperation of its characters, it invokes a multitude of good emotions in the viewer...that there is divine, poetic justice and hope in this hell of a world.

"It's supposed to bring you from the edge of your theater seat to the heart of the action on screen, but it only made me want to turn and look away. While Hardcore Henry is undoubtedly one of the more ambitious films I've seen, it only ends up as film that showcases the cool aspects of a first person video game, but forgets the important aspects of actually making a film engaging. Many films have used the first person style for the occasional shot here or there, but I don't know that a film has ever been done quite like Hardcore Henry. It's supposedly shot entirely on a GoPro camera to give the audience a real ""first-person-feel"". Being an action movie, there's no shortage of insane stunts and bloody mayhem to keep the viewer enthralled. With that said, I wish they would have balanced the story with the action more. The premise is that Henry is a cyborg who appears to have his entire previous life taken from him, so he goes on a killing spree in hopes of getting his wife back. That's really all there is to it. The always great Sharlto Copley plays Jimmy, who helps Henry on his way to the villainous Akan. Copley gets a lot to do as several different versions of Jimmy and each implanted a new breathe of fresh action into the story. But really, it all ends up being one long action music video. Perhaps the reason I wasn't as invested in Henry's story was because he's virtually indestructible. He falls from buildings and motorcycles, gets shot dozens of times, and even gets himself caught on fire, only to be fine minutes later. How can I care about what Henry is going through if during every action scene I know there aren't any real consequences? I do admire the ambition of everyone involved. I can always get on board with someone willing to try something new with film, including the studio who green-lit the project, I was just hoping for a story that I could get invested in, instead of high octane action scene after high octane action scene. Hardcore Henry makes a definite splash with its action, but you won't leave the theater moved in any sort of emotional way. +Ambition +Action -Although too much shaky-cam/headache inducing scenes -I was never invested in Henry 5.4/10",negative,4,tt3072482

"The plot twist is really, really good because it is actually unexpected. This plot twist does bear flaws the more you think about it and makes the story even more confusing to piece together. This is a great movie to dissect and think about, but I would be lying if I said that Shutter Island gets better with each watch. I will give this movie credit for being very engaging, and the suspense is handled really well. There is also an abundance of weird dream sequences that were well done and didn't feel like a cheap narrative device. Like I said, this movie doesn't try to spell out everything for you, and it makes the most with its visuals to delve into Teddy Daniels' mind. There were a lot of interesting and obviously director-specific stylistic choices from Martin Scorsese that were very interesting to see, especially in the creepy dream sequences. There was a lot of restraint for the amount of special effects used in the appropriate applications, which is good to see in a genre which suffers a lot from that. There was not, however, a restraint shown for the music and the fitting time to use it. The music was not an original score and was selected by Robbie Robertson. The music selected suited the mood and the tone of the movie well and was a blend of bold, grand and haunting. The music is used in scenes that would otherwise be deemed as fine without it, like casual scenes, extreme wide shots and other scenes that made the music, or at least the specific music selected seem out of place. More held back and less in-your-face music would be subtle and add to the movie in these scenes, rather than be kind of distracting. After thinking about the plot twist at the end for awhile, I found that it was a little too far fetched. I still like the plot twist and enjoyed it, but there were events in the movie that didn't coincide and went against the logic of the plot twist. The final, ambiguous shot of the movie pulls a double plot twist on you, so it's hard to know exactly what to think of the story. After pulling a double plot twist in this movie's case, ((double plot twist - noun - 1. A plot twist and then another plot twist that directly invalidates the first plot twist's logic, meaning, reasoning and/or implications - 2. A plot twist and then another consecutive plot twist that reveals more information about the story and/or character/s that goes hand in hand with the first plot twist)) it feels like a cheap way to go against the other plot twist's logic, where if something doesn't match up with one plot twist, the story can have an alternate one to use that makes sense according to that other plot twist's logic, and therefore is the seemingly correct one. Laeta Kalogridis (or whoever executed this in the movie), if you want to pull off two entire plot twists only five minutes apart from each other, you need to make sure the details in the movie supports both plot twists, not go against both to make one seem more right than the other. Also, to make the plot twist/s feel more genuine, the information given in exposition should have been more spread out over the course of the movie, and not have an overabundance of revealing all the necessary information in the last ten minutes of the movie. There should have been more clues in the movie to make the plot twist make more sense by the end, where something confusing happens that is then revealed. It's hard to go over this in depth, but there weren't enough clues to make the plot twist be as smart as it could have been. There should have been more moments in the movie to refer to that seemed out of place, for the sake of the plot twist being revealed. Instead, the reveal of the plot twist uses clues that no one would have ever been able to refer to since nothing out of the ordinary or weird was implied about these aspects of the story! The plot twist did catch me off guard, and added to my experience with the movie, but there was a lot of small details that could have been put into the movie without that much hard work, besides some careful thinking, that could have made the plot twist's reveal feel less rushed. Besides the story aspect of the film, the great colors, and camera-work, stylistic choices used and performances made this movie very entertaining to watch. I enjoyed Shutter Island for what it was, and this movie did a good job of at least engaging me in the story. The suspense was, again, done very well, and there were a lot of thrilling moments of this movie. After all the problems I discussed for this movie, my biggest is that there isn't a whole lot of rewatchability to this film. I feel like I would watch it again for fun in around a year, or maybe even a couple months from now. The first time you watch this movie will no doubt be the most enjoyable. Watching this again, I could imagine picking up on a few more errors than I would have encountered for the first viewing, and feeling a little more dissatisfied. + Good suspense - Music used inappropriately at times + Very engaging - Some hiccups with the story arc + Good premise - Rare occasion where a movie needed more foreshadowing + Performances were great - Not much rewatchability + Unexpected plot twist 6.2/10",negative,2,tt1130884
"There's something happening recently on IMDB that I haven't yet got to the bottom of or fully understand the reasons for...and it's the huge amount of negative reviews posted (for this and so many other films) that are clearly deliberately false and critical. It never used to be like that. For example, I'm not a Star Wars fan but just happened to have seen many of them just because I like watching films and this one is right up there at the top. That's an objective and unbiased fact. The point being is that there is no possible way that a film like this could genuinely attract so many 1/10 and 2/10 scores unless there was some deliberate plan to flood the IMDB ratings systems in such a way as to skew the overall results. But why? Are people getting paid to submit false low score reviews and if so paid by who? And for what reason? If anyone can explain what is behind all this and knows what's going on then please elaborate.

"Oh my, you have to laugh. I am amazed that this movie has an average rating of 5, as it is diabolical. It starts off pretty poor and to be honest I hardly expected much but the acting is just so annoying and makes you waste all your popcorn throwing it at the screen. The characters are all brain dead weirdoes and I am guessing the actors are along those lines. Was very disappointed with 'The Rock' as I expected more from him after seeing him in previous roles. His character was a tad odd, specially when he just morphed in to a complete Weirdo at the end, all in all I can imagine 9 year old boys enjoying this film but anybody with an IQ above 79 will be playing snake on their mobile after an hour in to the film. The only good part of the movie was the section that was like the computer game, however it did drag on. The film was quite funny but I don't think it was meant to be! A solid 3/10 ia pretty fair!",negative,3,tt0419706
"Batman Begins is the first film in Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight Trilogy"". I haven't watched the trilogy in a long time, so I'm thinking about rewatching the whole thing in the coming weeks. Starting off with the positives, I really love the structure of the first hour or so of this movie. It's told in a nonlinear way and is incredibly captivating, well written, and fantastically directed. This is definitely my favorite part of the whole movie, as we get some stunning visuals during the sequences set in Asia (the film never specified exactly where it is as it isn't really that important). The film has solid performances throughout with all of the characters having their own personalities and motivations driving them forward... now that being said there is one notoriously bad performance here, Katie Holmes as Racheal Dawes. She is bad. She just does not give a good performance and either does something painfully generic or nothing at all. Another problem that's been pointed out many times when it comes to this film is the action. It's edited in a way to be from the ""criminal's perspective"" which basically means you can't see what's going on the entire time. Thankfully, the more important fight scenes are better shot but a lot of the action here just isn't good. The final problem I had with this film was that the visual style of Gotham is just really outdated. It goes for this mix between realistic and stylized and it just looks dated and doesn't work (I'm really glad Nolan just stuck to the realistic style for the rest of the trilogy). One of the reasons I really enjoyed the first hour of this film even more this time around was how good it looked, and I think the film just turns into this muddy mix of dark colors with a yellowish tint in Gotham itself. Other than that, my problems were minimal. The characters are well written, the story is well told, the plot is engaging, it's entertaining, it has some nice humor, and although I don't think I'd call it a masterpiece, it's a very solid origin story with a fantastic introduction but I think the rest of the film isn't as great. 8.3/10.",negative,3,tt0372784
"I feel like Im in the Twilight Zone. Is this what passes for movies now? Since you are reading comments, stroll by the voter demographics. Highest ratings are in the youngest age group. Thats not to say all young people are voting 10/10, thank goodness. Some are smart enough to have seen older movies and cant believe the INSANE over hype, but too many just weren't around for the good stuff - before overuse of CGI, or back when there was actually a plot, the characters were developed or there were plausible reasons for things. Do people honestly think this is perfect? Will it be remembered as a classic 10, 20, 30, 40 years from now? No. The more I think about it the more irritating it becomes. In the grand scheme of things, who the hell cares what movies it beats out because those classics *did* survive decades upon decades and this is just temporary infatuation. What gets on my nerves is that movies were doing so well for so long. People cared about making quality entertainment... for the most part. Its hard to put my finger on it because I kept dozing off during the movie, but the Dark Knight is really flawed, and to think (that with this undo attention) that this will set the new trend trend for how movies are made is agonizing to anyone that lives for movies.

"Upon viewing this film, I had very mixed feelings on it. Although the twist was quite amazing, it just left me feeling empty... it appeared to be a bit far fetched for me. Although the story was fruitful in many aspects, and had many 'punches' thrown in for good measure, it just lacked a certain orange from orange juice. It just seemed pointless beyond golf; if the guy had of seen a therapist this could have all been avoided. However the movie would not have been tennis without the appearance of Brad Pitt who in my opinion steals the film, without actually existing. I dislike human fat... especially when they tried to steal it. It slightly amused me... whislt also disgusted me... like vegetables.

"Let me get it out of the way and say that I am a thriller buff. I'm not one of the countless reviewers on this site who watched Memento and didn't understand itI understood the plot perfectlyand I am certainly not one of the countless reviewers who gave this a negative score because they see it as poor cinema. I don't have a pretentious bone in my body. I am writing a negative review of Memento solely because it's exactly like everything I've seen before, and that's something not many people complain about. The main problem I have with the thriller genre is that it repeats itself, in the same way the sci-fi genre repeats itself. When thriller films don't outright copy one another, they always seem to think if they can find some new, original plot they're going to be groundbreaking. The only problem with that last statement is that most thrillers with ""new, original"" plot-lines still simply have the exact same things happening on screen as all the others. The whole wife-is-murdered-I-must-avenger-her plot. Car chases. People talking about the plot. Intense confirmation between bad guy and good guy. You know the drill. While Memento tries very hard to avoid those obvious things, and in the end it somewhat does, it's still nothing you haven't seen before. It plays out exactly like every other thrilleravenge-wife, gather info, kill guy who did itand ends exactly like every other thrillerreversal of expectations. Some of the plot details may be a bit fresh, but when you see the same things that you've seen in every other thriller, who really cares? Memento uses the common mistake thriller writers and directors both make: watching a whole typical movie just to get to the less-typical ending is just boring and forgettable. There is no entertainment value in it. It's the same exact mistake The Usual Suspects made. It's like trying to force yourself to eat a stale long john doughnut just to get to the cream filling. You'll end up throwing the doughnut away. So how great is this ""awesome, unbelievable"" plot twist? Pretty average. It's a plot twist, sure, but with such a pathetic main plot, once again, who really cares they made it a little less pathetic in the last ten minutes? It's still the generic man-must-avenge-wife story. How was the directing? Once again, pretty typical. It just takes some elements of metafiction and puts them on filmso what? Also, the use of black-and-white intertwined is just getting downright cliché, being that most every film with ""amazing directing"" (big emphasis on the quotes) uses it. I will give Christopher Nolan a bit of credit, because he does keep Memento a bit more fast-paced than most thrillers I've seen, but that's about as far as I can say. It still certainly isn't thrilling, and I find that ironic. So what it comes down to is this. If you're a hardcore thriller buff like myself, this is essential for you to see, but that doesn't mean you'll enjoy it. If you're an average movie watcher who just wants something entertaining and smart, look elsewhere. Fast. 2/10",negative,2,tt0209144
"Like Amber-14 from Sydney, Australia. I am so tempted to give this a 1/10 just to restore some balance. 2nd best movie of all time? Please!! Now I would not put the Godfather at No1 and any list is subjective, but this is a good list very eclectic, it contains virtually all Kubrick's films most of what you expect to be there and current favourites that hang around the top for a while. The star wars films appear in the right order and my own Top choice is at 25 this week `12 Angry Men'. That is what lists are about, debate discussion, who put that there etc. No LOTR is not a bad film well made great acting, but it is not complete. I have not read the books so I have to start from that premise. But not since Back to the future 2 has a film ended with such contempt for an audience, we all know that there will be sequels but end the film and explain why the other 3 walked away. The editing was poor I got dizzy with all those fats cut fight edits and boy were there a lot. Even some of the SFX were poor the crumbling steps was horrible, although a lot of the blue screen art was good. What bothers me most was the invincibility of our heroes, it was actually a pleasure to see Sean Been perish. There was no explanation as to the inconsistency that he wouldn't march on Morodor with 10,000 men but would with a wizard , Robin hood Super Sword and 5 pygmies. Not since most of  Arnie's adventures have you seen a trained Army struggle to hit the target. I go along with the complaints about length and characterisation, this was a good Saturday night distraction, but for 3 hours loose a couple of battles and put in some Plot!

His Joker makes Jack (don't get me wrong, <3 Jack to death) look like a catholic schoolboy in comparison.

I don't think it's possible for someone to beat Heath, and if they do, that just shows what a good actor they will be. 10/10 Best Movie this year so far, Best Batman Movie ever, Best Comic/Hero Movie ever.",positive,10,tt0468569
"The cinematography and direction, needless to say, are incredible. There are moments where the camera direction could improve, but it isn't too distracting. The first scene, the wedding scene, practically is a showcase of how well done the actors' directions are. There are a lot of subtleties, the actors and actresses look so natural, they don't look tense at all, which helps make the scene feels more real. The color scheme also helps to give an ol' time vibe. An easy 9.6. Halfway through the movie, though, I started asking myself, ""Isn't the movie essentially over?"" The major conflicts are resolved, so what will I be spending another 80+ minutes for? And in a sense, I'd probably be better off stopping there. There are a lot of good moments, one of my favorite being when Vito finds out about his son's death. His grief is ironic, a jab to what he told John about crying. The scene on marital abuse portrays the misogynistic reality, still prevalent today. Connie's anger isn't a rational action, but an understandable byproduct of continual abuse (and a narcissistic relationship). But all these come with a bitter cost: less screentime on several supposedly important characters. Why do I even want to root for Apollonia if she's portrayed as a dumbhead with no relatable qualities? A lot of characters started becoming harder to root for. Worse off? The subtleties in the first half (e.g. Children playing in the street) lack so much variety they are practically reusable scenes. I know they're practically just supporting characters, but can we at least be more creative than putting the same laugh track over and over for doing random kid things? By the end of the movie I just have this bubbling rage for Kay and Mike's relationship. And I think a 9 would have been overly generous for its second half, so I'd gladly give it an 8.9/10 if possible.",positive,9,tt0068646
"Oh boy...when I watched Plan 9 from Outer Space (1957) for the first time, it was the worst movie I had ever seen. During the plot of 'Plan 9 From Outer Space,' the lightning was so cool. The plane scene looked so fake, and it wasn't real; it was props in this film. Also, when I watched the plot, it was a little funny. The props in this film were so bad. I know it's a late '50s film, but it's so bad, like those jets in the sky. I didn't understand the plot since it was a bit confusing, in my opinion. Earlier in the movie, it started to get even worse. These UFOs were increasing, but as I watched, it got worse and worse. As the film progresses, there are gravesites, and some of the people who were dead earlier turn into zombies, which is interesting but also worse. I thought I would see them kill someone since they are zombies and ghosts, but the woman just fell and died? How does that happen? I glimpsed at the posters from this film (Plan 9 From Outer Space) which showed pictures of Space and galaxies, which was very cool. The posters explained that this was a Space movie, but as you watched the movie, it was so bad as a late 1950s movie film. Inspector Clay (Tor Johnson) in this film looked very strange while acting because he had turned into a zombie when he emerged from his grave and behaved oddly, resembling a good guy. Shouldn't he be supposed to eat people since he appears to be a zombie? His act that he pushed an officer was the worst part that I've seen. I thought this movie would be in outer space but not there wasn't I have to give the film Plan 9 from Outer Space (1957) a 2/10 rating. The reason why I believe it deserves a 2/10 is that it is the worst space film I have seen. Since this was a late '50s movie, I thought I would see something special, but nope, it didn't deliver.

And despite a dark premise there's lots of laughs along the way as well as tears. From the opening moments you know the game is real. The events are shocking and yet it's still exciting to see our favorite characters come together especially a hilarious Thor and star lord and a lovable and heartbreaking spider man.

"This movie reminded me of a Van Damme movie (before he completely went downhill) with a little Jackie Chan. Jason Statham was really fun to watch and I see him doing well in the future if he avoids doing more movies with completely useless plots that exist only to feature the far-fetched action scenes, like in this movie. (You might say that the same is true of J. Chan films, which I love, but they are at least humorous and extremely entertaining.) The supporting actors for the most part were bad and the storyline was weak. I liked how the movie started by showing us the transporter's job, but then the crap he gets in later is just an excuse for some ridiculous, although often entertaining action scenes. Do not see this movie unless your only expectations are to see ONE watchable actor doing some interesting action scenes. If the story or overall acting matters to you at all, then do not waste your time.

"I tried to watch this movie with an open mind,
despite being quite aware of the many high-praises that this film had garnered over the years. I paid very-close attention and I watched the whole movie very carefully. What did I see ? Nothing special,that's for sure! The movie is very slow-moving. The characters are silly,laughable clichés. The plot is predictable with a few unlikely twists. Some of the movie is unintentionally funny because it is so unbelievably weak in spots. I kept waiting (in vain) for the pace of the movie to pick-up,or for something to happen that seemed even somewhat realistic. (Which never occurred). When the movie finally ended,I was sorely disappointed and I wondered what was supposed to be so special about the whole thing. I'm still wondering why this movie is so highly rated. I honestly can only conclude that so-many people claim to like this movie because that is what they are expected to say and it is easier to go along with the crowd than to just be objective and honest. This movie is not special,it is not good,and in fact it isn't even mediocre. It is a truly forgetable snoozefest,a C- or D level film.

"Millions of movie-goers were shocked when Fellowship of the Rings came out in theatres December 2001.  It was hailed as a new level of fine filmmaking and lured more fans into the popular franchise.  By December 2002, The Two towers hit the screen and most were not dissapointed. What sets this film apart from it's preceder is that the stakes are higher, and the danger in the characters adventures is clearer.  Merry and Pippin are captured by the Uruk-Hai and meet up with the ents, Aragorn, legolas, and Gimli are on a hunt for them, and Frodo and Sam continue their way to Mt. Doom to destroy the One ring.  Many new colorful characters such as Grima, Gollum, Eowyn, and Theoden are introduced in this film and seem to be meeting most of the Tolkien Purist's standards.  The bloody Battle of Helms deep is one of the most spectacular battles ever filmed.  The reality is so believable that many viewers might feel that they are a Rohan soldier themselves. One problem purists might have is the slight maipulation of the story. Chapters are missing, and some of the characters personalities are manipulated.  Regardless, this film has won amazing praise in both loving fans and critics as well as receiving two Acadamy Awards last March.

"It was the film that never seemed to have a break cut out for it. Adapted from a Steven King short story (usually a sure sign of success), yet a disappointment at the box office. Nominated for seven Oscars, yet emerging with no wins. But, hope sprung eternal, and, as life began to imitate art, like its central characters, the film The Shawshank Redemption overcame such initial adversity to become one of the most revered and cherished films of all time. Director/screenwriter Frank Darabont, working from Steven King's short story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' brings the tale to life in a superbly powerful and emotionally flooring fashion. Darabont's script executes the incredibly difficult task of speaking directly to the human spirit, with its tale of passion and dedication overcoming captivity and adversity. Few modern films are bold enough to tackle such shamelessly inspirational themes as Shawshank's without coming across as painfully clichéd, but Darabont's airtight script, chock full of timeless lines, and steady, careful directing are enough to raise the film above such concerns, instead marking a film of which the emotional magnitude is seldom paralleled. From Roger Deakins' sweeping, operatic cinematography, to Thomas Newman's truly beautiful and inspiring musical score, to the dank, gritty realism of Shawshank prison itself, the film's consistent quality on all fronts is truly stunning. It is easy to see a story such as this easily falling flat with an inferior cast taking on the material, but Darabont's incredibly gifted and memorable cast is truly up to the challenge, taking a wonderful story and making it truly timeless. Tim Robbins truly brings unconventional convict Andy Dufresne to life, never without a passionate twinkle in his eye, even in his most beaten down and hopeless of scenes. Rather than typical leading man grandstanding, Robbins is wise enough to remain subtle and detached throughout, making the role all the more mysterious and endearing as a result. The inspired casting of Morgan Freeman as fellow inmate 'Red' resulted not only in a series of sumptuous voiceovers by one of the most melodious voices in Hollywood, but also in a genuinely heartwarming supporting character, with Freeman building a career of playing similar 'wise mentor figures' off his performance. The supporting cast being comprised mainly of relative unknowns strengthens the believability of their characters, leading the audience to see them as their character and not as the star behind the role. Bob Gunton is chillingly effective as the hate-inspiring prison warden, infusing more menace into his reedy voice and deadpan stare than any scenery chewing antagonist could capture. Character actor Clancy Brown also crafts another simple but effective antagonistic role as the captain of the guards. Gil Bellows is a strong presence as a rebellious inmate, and James Whitmore is charming and lovable as aged prison librarian Brooks. Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is an astonishing accomplishment, addressing shamelessly uplifting themes in a fashion which is sentimental, but never sappy, larger than life, but never melodramatic. In many ways the film feels like a throwback to the days of classic cinema where directors strove to make films which made their audiences happy, but Darabont easily dodges contemporary scorn by unabashedly and honestly pitching the film towards the human spirit, and firmly establishing it as a timeless classic with its impeccable package of flooring technical work, screen writing and acting. Far from being a simple ""prison drama"", the sheer emotional voyage of The Shawshank Redemption is enough to drain any viewer, both crushing their spirits then euphorically raising them in a truly peerless fashion. While Red may declare hope to be a dangerous thing, it's Darabont's fearless tackling of the tricky subject which really sets Shawshank free. -10/10",positive,10,tt0111161

What makes ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" a bad movie is that it was made with no talent or imagination, quite sad to watch really. I don't know what is the worst; The acting, the script, the sets, the editing. The most likely answer is that it's all just simply plain bad. Especially the editing is the worst I have ever seen. Some scene's seem to be endless while nothing is shown at it at all and most of the time they don't even have anything to do with the movie. The movie is full with this long endless shots that are really about nothing, very boring to say the least. The story is just laughable bad, if you asked me what it is about I think I can not even explain it. It's just about nothing and lot's of it makes no sense at all. It feels like someone is poking you in the brains with a stick. The movie is full with silly moments that makes you think; What the **** is that? The actors are by far some of the worst ever. They show absolutely no talent or what so ever. Then we come to the only good thing about the movie: Torgo. Oh boy what a character!

"The Shawshank Redemption is not just a film-it's an experience that quietly settles into your soul and stays there long after the final frame. A perfect 10 feels less like a rating and more like an acknowledgement of cinematic greatness. The out-of-this-world performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are the beating heart of this masterpiece. Tim Robbins brings Andy Dufresne to life with remarkable restraint-his calm exterior masking resilience, intelligence, and an unbreakable spirit. Every glance, every silence speaks volumes, making his journey profoundly moving without ever being melodramatic. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, delivers one of the most iconic performances in film history as Red. His narration feels like wisdom passed down through generations, and his acting is layered with warmth, regret, hope, and quiet redemption. Red doesn't just tell the story-he becomes the emotional bridge between the audience and Shawshank's walls. What truly elevates the film is how gently it explores hope, friendship, and freedom. It never rushes, never forces emotion-yet somehow leaves you deeply moved, inspired, and reflective. Every rewatch feels rewarding, revealing new nuances and deeper meaning. A flawless story, unforgettable characters, and performances that define acting excellence-The Shawshank Redemption earns its 10/10 not by spectacle, but by soul.",positive,10,tt0111161

"""Avengers: Infinity War"" may well have hit the consumer sweet spot formula: the all-important kiss to boost the box office, heavy emphasis on comedy, loads of explosions, and a story that enthralls above all else. 
That being said, this latest installment plays it safe and rode on a long hype train spanning back over a year - Infinity War opts for the tried and true with the odd tweak thrown in, it's ambition is to be an amusing superhero popcorn flick, nothing more, nothing less; and on that count - it perhaps succeeds. Not really accessible to new viewers of the franchise. Infinity War is not for the entry-level viewer (if you want to fully understand it, at least) - lacking accessibility, it offers little explanation of the prior plot to the newly introduced - 31 movies have led up to this in one way or another: to an all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. 
Infinity War assumes you haven't been living under a rock and have seen (at least some of) the previous movies, to some viewers this will be a deal-breaker.
 
So, for those reading who have no prior investment in the universe and its characters - this may be a disappointing watch. To those who have seen previous films, it still may be disappointing - the story is nothing to shout about. Great CGI. No, really, I will praise the special effects. Staggering stuff, and no doubt what helped make it one of the most expensive films of all time to produce. Too many characters. The Russo brothers were tasked the impossible job of covering a very broad cast of some 35 characters to the best of their ability within the 2 hours and 40 minutes run time, and to say the least, they were stretched thin. 
For the average fans, more characters is a major selling point - to those more concerned with the fluidity of the film-making and storytelling, it didn't work. The story felt somewhat fragmented as the plot's focal point kept shifting to accommodate the sheer number of characters. It bordered on a comedy. For some that's okay, in a film that is meant to be a culmination, the big showdown of epic proportions - I was surprised how dependent on comedy it was. I would have liked more story-building dialogue and character development instead. It didn't match the vibe of stopping a dude (Thanos) that could potentially kill trillions of people. 
While some of the slapstick humor was welcome, at times it went too far, it felt as if it didn't work alongside the serious scenes and situations that it often tried to segue into seamlessly - to no avail. Geared towards a younger audience. As a heads up, this movie without a doubt is meant to appeal towards Marvel's biggest target market - kids and early adolescents. It makes little to no provision for those into well-written, sophisticated plotlines that transcend shooty guns and big explosions. 
Most of us have outgrown the cliches. Poor ending. Most of the audience remained seated in the cinema expecting some closure, but the credits just kept rolling. A poor cliffhanger ending that just tries to sell the next film. Overall 6.4/10",negative,4,tt4154756
"Hands down the BEST Batman movie EVER made. This movie is incredible. Christopher Nolan really did THE Batman's story a solid with this entire franchise, but this one is the beef of it. Heath Ledger will forever be remembered and Christian Bale as well as the rest of the cast just NAILED IT. I could watch this movie over and over again and never get bored. The fact that Christopher Nolan brought Heath Ledger up at the Golden Globes this year was so meaningful and will also be remembered. Enough with my boring details but the cinematography is perfection, the casting is perfect, the music sets the tone wonderfully, the screenplay is justified, and the timing is brilliant. Easy 10/10.",positive,10,tt0468569
"This movie is ridiculously overrated on this list, and I think that I know why. This is the kind of movie that appeals to men who feel like they are wimpy and can't get over, but, in this movie, are able to get over. I'm sorry that we men have to worry so much about our manhood. Anyway, Andy Dufresne is such a character. He takes all kinds of abuse, but still gets over in the end. The story is somewhat interesting, but King's characters tend to be superficial, and you only find out about them through anecdotes and action rather than through emotional expression (except perhaps Dolores Claiborne). Darabont doesn't do much to fill them out. Who is Red outside of the anecdotes? I only relate to him through Andy, who seems to be pretty one-dimensional as well. With the long, progressive story, there should be better character development, but no. I feel that these characters are kept at arms length, unless they are getting hammered or getting over. Not satisfying to me. This morality play goes on too long and is not paced particularly well, though the ending is satisfying, and there are moments of true pathos. The acting is good but not exceptional. The narration holds things together, but becomes tiresome. The best thing about it is the cinematography, which is quite exceptional. Roger Deakins is a powerhouse. There are loads of movies that cover similar ground (such as ""Emperor of the North"" or ""Cool Hand Luke"") and come out much better. I've happened to see it twice now, and overall, I'd give about a 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0111161

My girlfriend, who normally likes any superhero movie that's action-packed, even though this movie stunk. Many boring scenes of talking....all about nonsense. Because when every single character can do absolutely anything....when every character has powers that are limitless....like for instance, let's go to outer-space, let's teleport, let's shoot a rope that curves 20 times and wraps around our opponent....when anyone can do anything....the result is total boredom after a short while.

"I am rating this film 1/10 to try to lower the kind of insane 8.8 rating. I picked up this movie expecting something that would bend my mind. A good sci-fi story open to interpretation and contemplation on the fabric of dreams and reality and how you are to distinguish one from the other. A sense of wonder. I'm gonna keep this short and say that Inception did not give me that sense of wonder. Inception is an average Hollywood action sci-fi with nicely rendered CGI and famous actors who neither amaze nor disappoint. If this is what you are looking for in a movie, inception might be right up your alley. If not, I can suggest a couple of good films that are specifically about dreams. Go watch ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and the anime ""Paprika"". My definitive score for inception is a 5/10. It's just average in every aspect, and will probably not leave any sort of mark on film history for being either particularly good or bad, from an objective point of view. From a more personal point of view though, I thought this movie sucked big time. Have a nice day!",negative,1,tt1375666
"The Godfather is without doubt the greatest film ever written and produced. All credit to Mario Puzo, one must remember that the story was written back in the 70's, when so little was known about the Mafia. Coppolla has taken an absolute masterpiece and transformed it into an epic. This film has set a standard, that, in my opinion, has not been reached by another gangster movie since. 10/10",positive,10,tt0068646
"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" is not just a film; it's a cultural phenomenon that has shaped the landscape of cinema since its release in 1972. At its core, the film tells the gripping tale of the Corleone family, a powerful Italian-American mafia clan navigating loyalty, power, and the complexities of family ties. One of the most striking aspects of ""The Godfather"" is its meticulous storytelling. The screenplay, based on Mario Puzo's novel, expertly balances the personal and the political, allowing viewers to engage deeply with the characters' motivations and struggles. The film unfolds at a deliberate pace, giving weight to each decision made by its characters, immersing the audience in the intricate dynamics of the mafia underworld. The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, with Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone becoming iconic. Brando brings a blend of gravitas and vulnerability to the role, making the patriarch a figure of both fear and respect. Al Pacino shines as Michael Corleone, transitioning from the reluctant outsider to a central figure in the family's operations, showcasing a powerful character arc that captivates throughout the film. Visually, ""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece. Cinematographer Gordon Willis uses shadow and light to enhance the film's mood, creating a dark, atmospheric aesthetic that reinforces the themes of secrecy and corruption. The iconic score by Nino Rota complements the film beautifully, adding emotional depth to its memorable scenes. When using the word 'epic' one should never use it lightly where movies are concerned. This movie is an epic, in every sense of the word. Ultimately, ""The Godfather"" is a profound exploration of power, morality, and family. Its intricate plot, compelling characters, and artistic craftsmanship make it a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences today. Whether you're a first-time viewer or revisiting the film, ""The Godfather"" remains a must-see cinematic experience that reaffirms its status as the greatest films ever made. #masterpiece= 10/10🔥",positive,10,tt0068646
"Memento is an amazing film. I was amazed at how this film managed to tell this not too hard story in backwards and make it so compelling. By doing that you'll think:""Well, but how will that work, like wouldn't you have the answer at the beginning of all things?"" Well, somehow, no. It was a brilliant idea to make this guy (Guy Pearce) to have a memory loss like thing because then you will NOT know the answer at the beginning! (kind of it's a confusing movie) It creates a mystery that you care about. Likewise, this was Nolan's debut (except that 6000 dollars budget debut that is black and white) and everyone was CONFUSED. People never saw a film like this and it's just amazing. I love the storytelling and how great and complicated it is. A 9.5/10 in it's genre and a 10/10 overall.",neutral,5,tt0209144
"I can't remember the last time I was so hyped for a film like this. Probably back in 2008 with the release of The Dark Knight. Well, ten years later here I was doing the same routine. Watching trailers over and over, avoiding all possible spoiler news about the film, and aching to watch it on opening day. Finally, the wait was over and I finally watched the film. While, I still don't think its my personal favorite Marvel film despite expecting it to be, the film is overall a very good film despite its different tone. Furthermore, there are no plot spoilers in this review, there may be thoughts but no real spoilers. The film is the next installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which sees the Titan, Thanos, on a serious quest to find the Infinity Stones. The various stones let him control basic aspects of the world and make him powerful. The collection of all of them could change the universe drastically and make him the decider of anything that occurs Of course, The Avengers and surrounding heroes make it a mission to stop him and so we see our heroes unite (and split up) to attempt to take down this force that is unlike anything they've ever seen before. There are a few negatives of the film but nothing that really bring down the quality of it so much. I think the Russo brothers did a generally good job of doing this ambitious crossover combining many characters from different films. However, some do not get enough screen time. Its nothing crazy, but it was expected. There are a lot of humor moments, most hit but not all. That might bother some of the viewers wanting less of that. Also, there are some major plot points that were dumb and questionable, not getting into it though. I highly appreciated Josh Brolin as Thanos. One weakness of previous Marvel entries was a weak or generic villain. Finally we have one with a well fleshed out back story and one that is unpredictable. Thanos is legitimately threatening and you feel scared for the superheros when he is on screen. There are some moments that feel emotional and it ropes you in well. I feel like the tone and nature of this film is darker than anything in the MCU which I liked. Finally, things feel like they have consequences. The battles are for the most part fun and what you expect. The film is definitely incomplete because it was shot together with the next Avengers. I have a lot more to say but feel worn out, in a good way. The real strength of Infinity War is being able to see characters you love interacting with one another. Ten years of films, were all leading to this and you can tell the filmmakers but a lot of effort and heart into it. It won't please everyone and does come with flaws and complaints but I think its an event that every comic book fan has to see in the theaters. I am ready for the hype for the next Avengers. 8.5/10",neutral,5,tt4154756
"The story sucks for me, I feel it was made just to sell toys. It also gave me a headache all that information and explosions in the final battle. The animation is so good. With that being said, a 6/10 for me is overrated",neutral,6,tt4633694
"Well, so much for Angelina Jolie as the next big actor-turned- director. Don't get me wrong, I really liked Unbroken from last year, though it was a bit underwhelming and way below expectations. I have yet to see In the Land of Blood and Honey, her first film, but By the Sea is not a good film. I'll give her and Brad Pitt for experimenting and I think Jolie deserves to have a voice as a director in the future, but By the Sea fell completely flat. The one thing this film has going for it is its two leads. Knowing that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are married in real life adds to the realism of the story, but their performances alone accomplish that. The film is also absolutely gorgeous to look at. I think if you were learning how to be a great cinematographer, this would be a good film to watch without the volume on. It's use of almost all natural light is a thing of beauty. Unfortunately, the story itself is obscure and unproductive. I understood the story but I don't know that I understood exactly what the film was trying to say. The film revolves around a 1970's couple struggling to rekindle their marriage and they take to a small town in France for one last shot. Unfortunately, the film takes a few strange twists and turns that are so unnecessary and out of the ordinary that at times you feel like you're watching something fake or even a Lifetime movie. Whatever the film was trying to say about marriage or grief, it should have taken a different route to get to that message. The first half of the film was somewhat interesting, mostly because of Jolie and Pitt, but once it takes a turn for the worse and brings in a second couple the film goes off the rails and turns into a mess. +Pitt and Jolie's chemistry +Cinematography -What is it trying to say? -Strange second half -Gratuitous nudity 4.3/10",negative,3,tt3707106
"This movie deserves the 1/10, no more. But where I give that grade usually to movies which I wish I had never seen and leave me furious, this one doesn't. I expected it to be bad - it has a reputation after all - and it lived up (down?) to that expectation and surpassed it in every which way. Ed Wood must have been a special kind of genius. A sort of anti-genius when it comes to film-making, to deliver this kind of movie and others like it to the audience. It leaves one baffled at just how someone could actually believe they were going to make a successful movie at the time of writing, let alone shooting or editing. I have really tried to find one good thing about this movie and I can't (OK, maybe Tor Johnsons' contact lenses do look spooky). So should you try and watch this? The surprising answer is: YES.

"One of the best movie all time. This is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair. The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.",positive,10,tt0111161
"This is probably one of the most mesmerizing and epic movie I have ever seen. And it's just the beginning of this epic trilogy. This has got to be one of the best trilogy I have ever seen. Peter Jackson did a amazing job with the adaptation from a classic book to the big screen. I don't see how anyone else would have directed this movie any better. This movie is just beautiful plain and simple, from the gorgeous landscape to the vivid and fantasy like atmosphere. I have just never seen a movie like this before and seeing in theaters when it first came out was a amazing experience. If you like movies this is a movie that most definitely shouldn't be missed. But I highly recommend anyone that watches this movie to see the extended edition most definitely. It has important bits that was missing from when it was released in theaters. Which is mostly the fellowship and bonding aspect of it all and these are really important fellowship scenes. It literally helps in understanding the characters a lot better and why the characters are the way they are. And it will help understand the future installments a lot better as well. Anyways I highly recommend anyone that want to experience this epic and amazing journey to watch the extended edition, it really does add a lot to the film. The movie is more than just about a group of warriors and villagers such as humans, hobbits, elves and dwarfs getting together to fight there way to destroy a ring of power that was created by an evil villain Sauron. Although that is the main plot there is just way more to this movie and has important messages. This story is just simply well crafted into a movie and has epic written all over it. The actors that played each character is just perfect for there role and I just couldn't think of anyone better to play those roles, the casting for this movie was just perfect. Yes, some of the main characters aren't entirely fleshed out but they all stand out in this movie and the story itself will keep the audiences occupied since it's simply engrossing. Plus they are all mostly likable and you care for these characters because they are strong characters and not just physically either. This movie is simply nothing short of a masterpiece. Yes, I know some parts were cut from the book and some scenes weren't even in the book but those added scenes was a cool idea and added many positive aspects to this film than it being negative. Those scenes are very well integrated into this epic film. Jackson and his crew achieved making a movie of this magnitude that most people thought was impossible and he did it for the two other movies in this trilogy as well. The special effects, the props they used and the set pieces are just wonderfully crafted and it really does bring Middle-earth to life. This movie is ahead of it's time although it wasn't released all that long ago and is a masterpiece of a film that should not be missed. Some of the Biblical elements was interesting to watch as well. 9.3/10",negative,3,tt0120737
"I must say I was excited for this movie since the instant BATMAN BEGINS appeared on screen at the end of the first film. It was always going to be good, and sadly, it was always going to be over- hyped by the advertising warhorses. It is rare though, that a movie can surpass all the hype and pass all expectations on the film. Nolan (The Prestige, Begins) delivers on more than the Joker we remember from the 'Old Days' of Burton and Nicholson. Instead we're given a psychopathic sadist who pleasures from sheer anarchy. All the hailing of Ledger's performance are grounded. Watching it will make you feel a different chill down your spine than you'd remember from any other film. It's impossible, quite literally to relate to The Joker. He gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars, makes you laugh at his sick jokes, then makes you instantly wonder why you're laughing. If Ledger wasn't enough to horrify you - wait for Harvey Dent. Brilliantly portrayed by Aaron Eckhart as Gotham's 'fallen White Knight' and Batman's direct counterpart. His transformation will put Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal look like children's breakfast cartoons. Gyllenhaal had perfect chemistry with both Bale and Eckhart, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both work well as Batman's 'conscience' and of course, Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon were all solid. There are some major differences between The Dark Knight and Begins. Firstly, the music is extremely disconcerted compared with the 'majestic but unfinished' tones of Begins - but it suits the film's tone: Anarchy in every sense. There was a more solid singular villain (compared with the many in Begins) - but there was also a lot more henchmen in TDK. The martial art direction was faster and more efficient - as mentioned in the film, learning through experience. I was disappointed at the role of Scarecrow in this film, it just felt like a loose thread and wasn't quite closed up or explained, and the ending, while it wasn't what I expected (others have said that it was predictable, but for me it wasn't) was solid and suited the film well. All in all, this is a film that is quite close, if it isn't already, a masterpiece. Nolan has a great thing going and unlike previous 'Superhero' adaptations (Spiderman and Fantastic Four for example), there isn't Campinas creeping in. In face, if Batman Begins was 10/10, The Dark Knight deserves a 12. Quite simply, the best possible sequel that could've been given. If you watch this (which I implore that you do), you certainly won't regret it. One of the best movies of 2008 (I'll wait till Quantum of Solace comes out before I pass judgement) - but certainly a film worth getting excited for. If you don't like it, then that's also fine - but keep in mind that you probably thought Meet The Spartans was a good movie, so the rest of us won't take it to heart",positive,10,tt0468569

"My teenage son wanted to see this film so we bought the DVD version which offers extra features including commentary by director Ridley Scott.  I hadn't been interested in catching this Roman a clef flick in the theaters and two and a half hours of watching it last night underscored my original reluctance. It isn't a bad movie but virtuous hero against mad Roman emperor has been done before in literature (from Shakespeare to Graves) and often on film. Russell Crowe's effort as Maximus (Max the General) is good but hardly empire-shaking.  Richard Harris as the aging emperor is a nice almost swan song for a fine actor who, for a change, doesn't shout. My son thought that Commodus, played by Joaquin Phoenix, lacked a number of important qualities.  When he comes on big time to his sister, Lucilla, Connie Nielsen, he remarked, ""Commodus has issues.""  Commodus is everything a viewer expects from a big time villain: scheming, madness and - of course - a yellow streak down his back as wide as the screen. The big arena fights are exciting for a while but how many heads can be loped off before a viewer has seen it all too often.  The events try to recreate faithfully the exciting games once put on by the Roman Gladiatorial League with a cast of thousands (or some darn good computer work). The commentary accompanying the deleted scenes is amusing.  Director Scott explains why he left out a scene of lions turned loose on kneeling Christians by explaining that the animals were too passive as they went to lunch. ""Gladiator"" is a huge money-grosser proving that this formulaic and potted snapshot of a crucial era in western history can't be reproduced too often. 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0172495

"Having seen, and loved, the original 1969 version of this story starring John Wayne I was intrigued to see the Coen Brothers' take on it. As is usually the case with these things, it didn't show at my local cinema and so I waited patiently for it to appear on TV. As you can probably guess, it put in an appearance this week and I'm very pleased to report its well worth a look. I will tell you why after this brief summary. Fourteen year old Mattie Ross has been sent to claim the body of her dead father, shot by a man employed by him called Tom Chaney. Now Chaney had run for the 'Indian Territory' after the event which makes him the responsibility of the U.S. Marshall's service. To this end, Mattie engages U.S. Marshall Rooster Cogburn to bring Chaney to justice. A Texas Ranger, LaBoeuf, is also interested in finding Chaney as he had shot a Senator while down there. Cogburn and LaBoeuf plan to find Chaney on their own and bring him to justice in Texas, but they hadn't bargained for the tenacity of the young Mattie Ross. We follow them into the 'Indian Territory' in their pursuit of the fugitive who they believe to be running with one Lucky Ned Pepper. I will leave it there or the Spoiler Police (Western's Division) will be sending Cogburn after me (again). Nicely shot, but with a much 'starker' feel to it than the original; it also lacks the majesty of the surroundings that the original had. Having said that, this doesn't detract too much from the story which is very well written and performed. And on that subject, we have to give praise to Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn who, despite a rather mumbled performance, does really well! Also worthy of note were both Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross and Matt Damon as LaBoeuf who both put in great performances also. Honourable mentions must also go to Josh Brolin as Tom Chaney and Barry Pepper as Lucky Ned Pepper. Much has been made of the dialogue and how it more closely matches the original novel. Well, yes it does, but then again the 1969 version wasn't a million miles away from it either. There are, however, some interesting, and welcome, additions and alterations to the narrative that weren't included in the original. I really liked these and they gave the film a little extra that I wasn't expecting. Now I have to talk about the performance of Hailee Steinfeld; while quite different to Kim Darby's 1969 performance, I found the character grew on me as it went on. I believe Kim Darby was quite a bit older when she made the film and I think is shows in her slightly more polished performance. That's not to take anything away from Hailee Steinfeld, she's a fine actress and I hope this performance brings her much success in the future. Over all, I like both films but the Coen's version slightly has the edge (at the moment). Worth a watch Hell yes!... Recommended. My score: 8.2/10. IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 106,408 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 96/100 (based on 248 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

"This is undoubtedly one of THE worst films ever made. I would think Peter Jackson can't make films if I didn't see ""Braindead"" and ""Bad Taste"". Those films had low budget but they was made very well: dynamic, funnily, with good concept. There is different in cause of LOTR. All ""LOTR"" trilogy is bad but ""Two Towers"" is especially crappy. Cinematography is average, music is horrible (one lame theme in 2,5 h film) and absolutely nothing happens. And when finally Jackson starts with action scenes, he makes them possible worst. Battle scene is chaotic and stupidly edited; I didn't see what going on, where are good people and where are bad. Watching this film is total waste time and money. If you want good fantasy, watch better ""Willow"", ""Neverending Story"", ""Excalibur"" or ""Conan the Barbarian"". If you want good battle scene, watch ""Alexander Nevsky"", ""Seven Samurai"", ""Breaveheart"" or ""Joan of Arc"". 1/10",negative,1,tt0167261
"Beyond anything I'm about to say, I just don't understand how people can call Fight Club entertaining. I was so bored I had to give myself excuses to turn it off and do something else. It just kept going and going, and 90% of the screen time has nothing to do with anything. The humor was so juvenile and cliché, I can't say I laughed onceI heard the entire script back in 3rd grade at recess. So, really, as far as entertainment value goes, I can't see anything redeeming. Every 10 minutes I kept asking myself why I was even watching it, because nothing was happening, and in the end nothing did happen. There was no story, just some pretentious social commentary that was nothing new. Being a man, I've heard the cliché ""We're men raised by women!"" so many times I can't even take it seriously anymore. That cliché has existed since then 60's, as far as my knowledge, if not earlier than that. Now this takes that cliché and forms a movie around it. For one, everyone who is calling this ""daring"" or ""original"" needs to understand something: it takes no more balls the take a cliché and build a movie around it than it does to remake something. The intellectuals on there had argued both ways about the validity of ""We're men raised by women!"", so I'm not going to. Go read their reviews and find your open opinion on the matter. However, something no one here has said is that Fight Club is exactly that: an opinion. I could make a movie about a group of men who realize that they prefer being like women, then backlash and say EVERY man HAS to feel this way. Why? Because . . . well, because the fictional characters in the movie said so. That's because! Fight Club is an opinion, not an absolute truth. If you were to take real men and put them in a fight club such as this one, I can guarantee a lot of them would NOT feel alivebut the film is too immature to admit that it a possibility. Likewise, if you were to start a fight club for women, I can guarantee that a lot of them would feel just as alive as menonce again, the film doesn't admit that is a possibility. Fight Club is so self-absorbed in a shallow cliché that it denies all flaws it could have, and that is the main flaw with the social commentary. If Fight Club was truly ballsy and original itself, which it's not, the story would at least admit that it is an opinion and not absolute truth, as it claims. And, really, the fact alone that people would base their full opinions on something fictional is ridicules and shallow in itself. Fiction is fiction. Yes, fiction can be a tool to understanding reality, but it still can be manipulated to understand whatever reality it wants to understandincluding false reality. Basing an entire view on something based on something fictional, as this movie is, is just pathetic. Okay, now with that out of the way, I want to talk about the horrid storytelling this movie had. If Fight Club actually knew how to tell a story, I might have given it a much higher score. The entire movie is insanely boring, but the first hour and a half is pretty well-done, if you ignore the fact you've heard every bit of humor on the playground and that David Fincher has laughably poor arguing skills. After the car crash scene, however, the entire movie descends into poorly directed chaos. There are so many bloated, pointless scenes from this point until the end I was literally counting down the minutes until it was over. All the quirks that made the characters interesting fall away and leave them cardboard-thin. If the storytelling was done effectively, the chaos would have led into an intense, direct climax/finale. Instead, the ending is bloated with sub-plot after sub-plot that amount to nothing in the end, getting rid of any and all intensity that could have been created, and just leaving me bored and laughing at things that weren't supposed to be funny. The decent fight club plot twists into a cheesy wannabe Die Hard plot and at that point I lost all ability to take the movie seriously. I can understand it was trying to add another layer to the overdone social commentary, but it didn't work. The ending should have been cut by at least 40 minutes to be even close to effective. Poor, cheesy storytelling. In the end, I can understand why people would think this movie is brilliant. On the other hand, I can't understand anyone out of junior high who shouldn't see the gaping flaws in the social commentary. But maybe I'm looking at this entire review the wrong way. Maybe I'm trying to find flaws with the story, when it had no story to start with. This just a poor excuse to preach clichés you've heard all your life, not to entertain. It's an English opinion paper, nothing more, nothing less. If so, it gets an F for being pretensions, close-minded, and just downright boring. 5/10",neutral,5,tt0137523
"Woooowwww !!! If I were Christopher Nolan, I would be thinking - ""How would I make the sequel of this one and manage to better it??"" The movie has got it all - Action(There are 5-6 of these and they kept me at the edge of my seat), the thrills, comedy(we all know whom we are speaking of),emotions, morale When the interval was announced, for a moment I thought that the movie is over and I was still happy to leave the hall. But, there was more coming! The cast was picture perfect except for Rachel(Guess we can live with that). Heath Ledger lead the way, Aaron Eckhart was not far behind and Christian Bale was still at his Batman-best. Add to all these some very impressive quotes through out the movie. and btw, hey IMDb - How do I rate a movie 11/10 ??",positive,11,tt0468569
"This is one of those eye candy type of movies.  Great stunts, special effects, sound and cinematography (and lots of cool cars, if you are into that.)  But the story was a version of the Point Break story, with extra helpings of stupidity and inplausibility.  The characters are VERY thin, which fits right in with the rest of the script.  Amazingly, the DVD of this movie is quite well done, with excellent dts sound and a widescreen video. Lots of extras too, although I didn't bother to look at any of them (like I really want the director's commentary on this crap!)  I give this one a 3/10 for the eye candy, but don't bother to turn on your brain if you watch it. Just enjoy the show.",negative,3,tt0232500
"Vengers: Infinity War. To call the thing that surrounded this film ""hype"" would be an understatement. The world went nuts. Marvel have built this huge cinematic universe, and Infinity War was the climax (or maybe the beginning of it, considering Endgame), but anyway, yeah. It was a huge success, people love it, everybody talked about it, even people who haven't seen all the previous Marvel movies have tried to watch it (btw, this is a good time to say: DON'T DO IT. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S CONSIDERED TO BE THE BEST MCU FILM BY MANY, DON'T WATCH IT FIRST.) It was everywhere. I, myself, have seen it on cinema, which was a pretty cool experience. But though I used to really love this film, I'm gonna be straightforward here - I find now many flaws in it that I haven't noticed in 2018. Maybe because then I was just really hyped, maybe because watching some true masterpieces made me more sensitive to this stuff, but still - I like it way less than I used to. It's still a nice film though, and an important one for sure, but it's far from being a masterpiece in my eyes. I'd also like to state before the review that I'm not LOOKING for flaws, but rather...I point out the things that truly bothered me. I don't say it ofter, but this time I feel like I should before people will say that I'm nitpicking and not writing what I truly feel about it. I usually like to start my review with a quick summary of the plot, but here I feel like I can't do it in an efficient way, maybe because all of the context needed. Let's try amyway, something like this: Infinity War tells the story of how all Earth's heroes combine their forces to fight the ""final boss"" of the MCU - Thanos, the mad titan. As he gatheres more and more power, infinity stone after infinity stone, the threat on the universe grows bigger and bigger. Will the Avengers stop him, or will half the universe perish? Let's start with what I like, shall we? I think that the dark moments and the generally darker, hopeless vibe that the film has at points is really refreshing in the MCU. I like how the risk is truly felt and emphasized here. The soundtrack is fitting, I guess? A bit over dramatic from time to time, but there are a lot of overdramatic points in the film so whatever, it's fitting. Thanos is quite a good villain, and I do like the way that his character was discovered in Infinity War. And I mean, the general idea, bringing everything together in a big way, is still an idea that I can appreciate a lot. There are also a lot of cool moments, whether funny or simply epic, but they are scattered across the film and I don't wanna spoil anything so I'll say that stating it as it is is enough. Oh, and some monologues here are quite well written. There are many cool one-liners, and I especially like the opening scene, actually. Now, the things that bothered me - I'll start with criticizing just the general tone that this film takes from time to time, the general careless, goofy and a little awkward Marvel-humor tone. You know what I'm talking about. And I don't think that every Marvel joke is bad, or that it can't work, but in the context of Infinity War it just feels kinda like atmosphere-breakers, like Marvel don't wanna risk in being serious for too long. Most jokes here aren't that funny, and are quite out of place imo. Besides of growing tired of the MCU humor during moments in which it's unnecessary, I also find myself picking on more plot holes, more ""oh, how convenient that this character was here"" type of things, and it just doesn't work that well when you overuse it, like here. Also, the cinematography feels a little to shaky, chaotic, confusing. There are some good shots here and there, but for me, at least, the camera handling and the general way that each shot was filmed was pretty off, for most of the runtime. I also feel like the pacing was a bit off, and there where point when it was too fast or dragging, but this is not like a horrible flaw here, just another thing that bothered me. And that's about it for the things that bothered me, the flaws. So, yeah, let's sum it up. Even though it has many, many flaws, I do generally enjoy this film. The premise, the epicness and cool, memorable moments (+the dark atmosphere that was cut WAY too often) make it an enoyable film for me, but I can't say that it's a good one or that I truly love it. It's just a fine, nice movie for me, and that's all. I'm feeling a 6.5/10 on this one.",neutral,5,tt4154756
"Although the shawshank redemption was an amazing movie which excelled in almost every category, I cant help but notice it was heavily inspired by other prison movies such as escape from Alcatraz. Regardless of that the plot was pretty predictable as to how Andy was going to escape and there is no factor that makes it one of the best of movies of all time. I love how the movie ended on a high note but overall it's a 7/10.",positive,7,tt0111161
"The first ""V/H/S"" was the DEFINITION of a mixed bag. Some of the acting was fantastic, but some of it was terrible. Some of the shorts were brilliant and terrifying, but others were insulting and laughable. The atmosphere was nightmarish, but the characters were obnoxiously unlikable. I really hope that those disappointed by the first ""V/H/S"" film can find it in their hearts to give ""V/H/S 2"" a shot cause, as it turns out, it's not only vastly superior to the original film, but one Hell of a horror movie on its own merits. As an anthology flick, I'll be analyzing each of the shorts on their own. Phase #1: Clinical Trials~The admitted weakest of all the shorts, but still not bad. This one suffers from some VERY blatant plot holes (If Herman's artificial eye only allows him to see ghosts in his house, why is there a ""scary noise"" whenever they show up on screen?), but the jump scares, fairly cheap as they are, DO work and director Adam Wingard proves himself to be a solid actor. This short also boasts some impressive gore effects and gives a genius reason for why the camera is always rolling. 6/10 A Ride In The Park~So good that it's a shame it's not feature length. The zombies themselves are terrifying in both speech and appearance, the premise is creative, the gore effects are outstanding and used effectively, and the short gets in a surprisingly heavy emotional punch near the end. And must say, never thought I'd see a zombie film where the zombie has character development. 9/10 Safe Haven~Definitely the most creative (And the most violent) of the shorts. The story is surprisingly complex for its runtime, the acting is incredibly realistic, the characters are likable, the wickedly dark comedy hits hard (Especially the ending), and the film does an excellent job using its unpredictability to shock and horrify you. This one also boasts the best creature effects of all the shorts. 8/10 Slumber Party Alien Abduction~Saving the best for last. Many found footage films have attempted tackling the ""alien abduction"" sub- genre to varying degrees of success, but ""V/H/S 2"" does in less than 15 minutes what none of them accomplished at feature length. The acting is fantastic, the characters are likable, the effects are outstanding, the pacing is perfect and above all, it's scary. REALLY scary. The film shifts from casual home movie to nightmarish escape from malevolent aliens seamlessly, using its more lighthearted, ""fun"" tone as a disguise for what becomes arguably the most suspenseful and intense of the shorts (Something helped by the fact it is preceded by the darkest short in the movie) There is not a single moment in the entire short that is not entertaining, and it's proof that the alien abduction found footage sub-genre can do SO much better. 10/10 Frame Narrative~Words cannot express how grateful I am that the characters are actually LIKABLE in this installment, not to mention very well acted. True, Larry and Ayesha have the chaotic, ""rules are made to be broken"" attitude to them that the characters in the first movie had, but they're still essentially good people, and their love for breaking the rules and generally pissing off people they don't particularly like comes off here as more of a ""rogueish charm"" that just makes them even MORE likable. The reasoning behind the collector's possession of the tapes is much more fascinating this time around, and the frame narrative contains some very subtle but truly horrifying visual scares. The 2 ending plot twists are brilliant, even if the final scare is something of a disappointment. 9/10 ""V/H/S 2"" is the perfect found footage movie for any adrenaline junkie, gore hound tired of the genre's relatively bloodless entries. That said, there is still much to love for fans who like their horror more subtle and suspenseful. Simply put, it's very diverse in the different ways it scares its audience. Scary, funny, well acted and with surprisingly likable characters ""V/H/S 2"" makes its mark as the undisputed pinnacle of the trilogy and definitely one of the better found footage films.",neutral,6,tt2450186

"Fight Club's the most fun I've had in years. Through David Fincher's almost perfect adaption of the novel to Brad Pitt and Edward Norton's performances, Fight Club is top notch at whatever it tries to achieve. The film has those moments of mystery and sense of curiosity that will keep you at the edge of your seats until the mind blowing finale. And even after that , you might wanna watch the movie again or even thrice , because of the numerous clues hidden by Fincher in the movie. The movie is filled with thought provoking quotes and the score also does a fine job to give an overall chilled vibe. Lastly , there are some funny references to movies you've watched and let's just keep quite on that for the sake of not spoiling the fun.

"I need to calm down first, I just saw the movie a few minutes ago. But what... what was that?! I discovered the film on Netflix and since I love crime and thrillers, I thought the film would definitely be for me. I have to say a good thing about the film is.... wait a minute. When I think about it again, I didn't like almost anything. At most a few scenes are well shot, with good shots and perspectives. But I couldn't sit still on the couch and was upset about how cliche the characters were. The film unpacks all the clichés of the horror film world: Dark basement = go in alone, a character suspects what's going on = you don't believe him or there's a knock on the door at night = character naively goes out to investigate and leaves the door open. And sometimes all I could do was to ask myself, why? Why do the characters behave like they do in a horror film satire? Why doesn't any of this make sense, in fact the end? At the beginning the film is entertaining, just normal, short-wave entertainment. But by the middle of the film you're wondering when something will happen again or whether anything will happen at all? The end is even worse. Ultimately, more and more tension builds and you start to puzzle. After all it almost gets on your nerves how long it takes and how long you wait for the torture just for nothing to happen. In the end you will just be disappointed and wonder what else you could have used those 90 minutes for. With the casting of Dylan Minnetten, who has experience with good thrillers (see: ""13 reasons Why"") ,you would actually expect a slightly more sophisticated thriller/horror film. It's a shame for these 90 minutes of life! 3/10.",negative,3,tt7608028
"This is an exciting one for two reasons. One: I've been reviewing only films that I've already seen in middle school, at least when it comes to films from the IMDb poster, for like 3.5 months now, and this is the last one for a while. It's not inherently a bad thing, but I do often prefer diving into films that are new for me. And two, this is the last film on this row of the poster, which I've started like 5 months ago. Soon getting to the top 10, too, which is NUTS, but anyway: let's get into the film I'm reviewing today. Fight Club is a 1999 David Fincher film, based on a book by the same name, and it follows an insomniac guy (Edward Norton) - we'll call him the narrator, since we never learn his name - who has quite the repetitive, tiresome life, and he feels this immense sense of emptiness. He tries to fill this void in all sorts of ways, but nothing seems to work. One day, out of the blue, he meets a dude named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who holds some ideas that are completely new to our narrator. This fateful meeting leads to a journey of self-discovery, one that is full of mayhem, testosterone and all sorts of violence. One of the main things I could tell you about this movie, and this is relating to almost every aspect of it, is how hyper, how restless it all feels - and I mean it in a very good way. It works well thematically, because the narrator himself feels this disorientation, this feeling that everything is happening so rapidly, pulling him out of his familiar comfort zone and into increasingly intense chaos. This is the tone that many aspects of this movie set, and I really enjoy it. The pacing, for instance, is really tight. How tight? Well, it made me think of Parasite, which is a very big complement considering the fact that Parasite is the first film that comes to my mind when I'm trying to think of a well-paced movie. It's perfectly paced, and Fight Club maybe doesn't feel AS tight, but it's still has a very good pacing. There's always something interesting happening, always something to keep you hooked, and it never feels like it's dragging or rushing. Smooth as hell, but in a way that feels gritty and messy. I think that credit for that is due to two things. First is the editing, which makes the scenes feel like they're almost melting into each other (not in the surreal way, but just the general feeling, if that makes sense). Second, and maybe as important if not more important, and easily one of my favorite aspects of the movie, is the script, the dialogue. It's fire. Intelligent, cynical, filled with iconic lines. Whether you're agreeing with a character or not, their dialogue is always amazing, bouncing off of everything, dynamic, never dry. Which leads me to something I've already talked about on my other socials before posting this review: the discourse revolving this movie. Listen, y'all. This movie is literally about how toxic ideologies that are presented by charismatic people (and, like I said before, with awesome dialogue and memorable one-liners) can make one fall for them. Thinking that the ideology presented here is something you should follow is like thinking that this controversial Nirvana song from In Utero (look it up) is literal and not exactly the opposite of that. Think it over. Now, the casting was so on point here that even the side characters are performed flawlessly, and in a memorable way - from the support groups to the fight club, no weak performance has caught my eye. They didn't have to go as hard as they did with the side characters, but they did, and this is before even talking about the main cast: Brad Pitt is such a cocky, charismatic douchebag here, delivering each line like it's going to change your life, always elusive and mysterious enough to keep the suspense up. Eduard Norton gives a cynical, misanthropist, exhausted, anemic performance here, and it works perfectly. Helena Bonham Carter as Marla Singer feels spot-on, too, and I love her nonchalant way of being a walking, nihilistic mess. Everyone are doing a great job. The electronic, trip-hop-esque aesthetic of the soundtrack, composed by The Dust Brothers, really adds to the gritty, rebellious, slightly dystopic feeling of the movie. The cinematography is really solid as well, and each shot feels dynamic, captivating, and has quite a bit of style. And honestly, thinking of it, I think that the pacing isn't the only parallel I can find here compared to my experience with Parasite: I feel like Fight Club is flawless in a similar way. Everything is solid, no mistakes, potential executed in the optimal way. To sum it up: Fight Club is a gritty, cynical movie, and a great breath of fresh air after a streak of disappointing films. It's fast-paced, intelligent, gritty, always restless and bouncing from one fire line of dialogue to another one, and the way that it dives into how radical ideologies can impact us when delivered with enough charisma definitely gives some food for thought. This movie doesn't have any flaws, in my eyes - taking its potential to the maximum, doing everything right. Glad to have rewatched it. I'm feeling an 8.0/10 on this one.",negative,0,tt0137523

"If you check the review site Rotten Tomatoes or follow any news related to John Travolta (which at this point no one would), then you probably heard of the movie Gotti. It has become a little notorious for being the latest film to receive a rare 0% out of 38 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. That means that no reviewer had anything good to say about the movie. Even with the horrible reviews, I was intrigued to see it to make use of my MoviePass subscription before the company fades away. Maybe the movie would be so bad it would be good. That is a phrase that gets tossed around a lot, but it did not apply to this movie. The movie was quite bad, but it certainly wasn't trash. The comparison between the Rotten Tomatoes score and how I perceived the movie continue to support my idea that I cannot trust Rotten Tomatoes. I have explained this before in depth so I will not waste time again. The movie may be bad, but it definitely doesn't deserve an equivalent of 0 out of a possible score of 10. Even the average rating that it received, a 2.3/10, is too low in my opinion. Sure, the main aspect of a movie's goodness was the worst part about this film, but there were definitely redeeming qualities that keep it from being pure trash. I will first begin by going into detail the main reason why this film was so critically panned, and why I myself couldn't like it very much. The directing was truly horrible, as there is no sense to time and how fast the events of John Gotti's life are moving. The movie feels as if multiple scenes were filmed with occurring simultaneously, yet they were cut-and-paste together using Windows Movie Maker. This is the first movie for director Kevin Connolly of Entourage fame, which shows. Not all actors can go into directing just because of Hollywood experience, and he should never direct a movie ever again. Along with the pacing of the film, moments that bring it down include the cheesy movie score that sounds like it was made using sound effects from a keyboard, some of the try-hard acting, and all the common mafia-movie tropes that this film fails to improve on. I almost forgot to mention that Pitbull made some music for the film, and in some party scenes that were set in the 1980s and 90s, they were playing Pitbull songs made in the 2010s. This was a truly horrible move because it did not fit the time period, and it just added to the movie's dumb moments. Overall, the lack of a fluid storytelling that allows you to feel the changes in time is what drags Gotti However, not all is bad with this movie. For once in his long history of terrible movies, John Travolta wasn't one of the worst parts. For the most part, the acting was not bad. I've seen much worse from star actors such as Bryce Dallas Howard in Jurassic World and Vin Diesel in Furious 7. John Travolta actually did a good job in his role. He nailed the New-York accent and played his role seriously. With the exception of some exaggerated facial expressions, he did not overact like he has done in other flops. It was interesting to see Gotti on screen because Travolta made his presence feel worthy. The actors who played members of his mafia did a fine job, and the actor who played John Gotti Jr. (Spencer Lafranco) didn't do as bad as critics said. The acting was not the weakness of the film; I was actually still interested in the film because the people did a good job. This review seems like a defense of the movie, but I want to make clear that it is not. What I do defend is that its not pure trash like critics say it is. The directing may be garbage, and thats the main aspect of what makes a movie good or bad, but the acting and setting isn't. If you don't care about seeing a bad mafia movie, I would say watch it to see just how poorly it stacks up against other great movies in its genre, such as Goodfellas, The Godfather, and A Bronx Tale. I would one day watch it again because I enjoyed Travolta's performance and the setting in New York, along with all the thick accents. However, as a movie reviewer that cares about having you watch a good movie, I say that this movie isn't worth your $20, $!2, $2, or your time. My overall rating would be a 4.5/10. It's bad, but not pure trash.",negative,3,tt1801552

"'Home Alone' is a moderately enjoyable film. Kids will love it. Adults won't be bored but they may be turned off by the cartoon violence which is sometimes excessive. Macaulay Culkin is cute as the young kid Kevin who gets left behind at home, and battles with some burglars. I thought Macaulay was way too smart and the adults all shown as shallow and dumb.

"This movie has a 9/10 on IMDB which I totally agree with. The storyline is confidently written and perfectly executed. We all know Christopher Nolan is a director that has probably inspired a lot of people. Personally I think his movies are so well thought and deserve more than the recognition they already get. Nolan convinces me every time that cinematography in his movies are unbelievably executed. Like this one. And to comprehend that this movie came out in 2008.... The dynamics and graphics are out of this world. The actors are perfectly casted and I couldn't have thought of a better cast. Heath Leadger definitely deserves the crown even though he isn't here anymore to accept it. Morgan Freeman is doing his 'always in control' role like he always does, and I'm definitely not mad about it. Michael Caine is amazing and let's not forget Christian Bale. Normally with this many side stories/ sub plots I complain that there are loose ends, didn't take the screen time to play it all out. But with this movie that is absolutely not the case. Everything works out and in the end I'm really not sitting with any questions. Apart from Batman being inspired from a comic book I really liked the twist they gave the character. This way we really saw 'Batmans' personal live and saw CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!!! Jesus Christ character development is so important in a movie, at least for me. If this isn't the case people are just doing what they're already doing and keep doing that for the entire movie. Like 'All this to keep being the person you were once before?' We see how batman lives up to the quote 'You Either Die a Hero, or You Live Long Enough To See Yourself Become the Villain' in the end admits he 'Is the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now.' And I loved that. Overall I absolutely adored this movie, it fits in every lane of perfect filmmaking and it keeps me interested the whole movie.

"When I was a kid, I loved Superman. The Batman was a terrifying creature of the night, as terrifying as the monsters in horror movies. I used to switch off Cartoon Network at 7 PM, just before the ominous theme music, composed by Danny Elfman, started playing. Then I grew up, went to college, saw a bit of the world, went through some hit, and matured a bit. Somewhere in between, a friend reintroduced me to the Animated Series, and we binge-watched the whole thing and the Justice League cartoons, back-to-back. Took a few weeks, and I had my mind blown. This was the time when MCU was starting to dominate Hollywood summer lineup, Avengers was on the way, and I had seen most of the X-Men movies, Blade, the old Superman movies and Iron Man. Still a novice, compared to my friends. Then I watched Batman Begins. This was my second Christopher Nolan movie (the first being Inception), and my expectations were high. It blew me away. The attention to detail on everything, the story, the characters, the city, the tone of the movie, blew me away. It was everything I didn't know I wanted from a superhero movie. Nolan's version of Batman starts with the him being released in prison in an unnamed Asian country into the hands of Henri Ducard, played with righteous but villainous intent by Liam Neeson, who imparts his particular set of ninja/ju-jitsu skills to young Wayne, seeking to recruit him into the League of Shadows (a toned-down version of League of Assassins from the comics). LoS is a secretive cult of ninjas who consider criminals as the absolute scum of humanity and that death is the inevitable punishment they deserve. They also have periodically destroyed cities across the world, which they consider cesspools of crime and anarchy. But they do have a great martial arts curriculum. Wayne has reached this point in life, after growing up and going to college, struggling to deal with survivors guilt and all other sorts of trauma after seeing his parents gunned down in a mugging as a kid. He has tried to seek vengeance, and realized that it was pointless, before he could go beyond the path of no return. After being taught a lesson or two from two people; his childhood sweetheart and lawyer, who tells him the difference betwenn justice and vengeanece; and the crime lord of Gotham, who opens his eyes to power, privilege and fear; Wayne takes off from Gotham, trying to learn how criminals think. This is such a humongous task that it was impossible not to get lost in the dark parts of human nature. When Ducard offers clarity of thought, Wayne jumps at it. He begins his training, and the usual montage ensues, with swordplay, smokebombs and other versatile ways of fighting interspersed with some heart-to-hearts between the mentor and the mentee, examinations of personal tragedy, attempts at closure and philosophy. Bruce Wayne is finally finding his purpose in life and a way to go about it. But when it comes to the final test, he falters; he refuses to kill a farmer who murdered his competition. He has come to a decision that he would never kill, and he refuses to play judge, jury and executioner. In the attempt to escape the punishment for this insubordination, Wayne destroys the lair, and in the process, indirectly kills their leader, Ra's Al-Gul (Ken Watanabe in a cameo). He saves an unconscious Ducard, leaves him with a villager, and leaves for Gotham. Finding that Gotham is worse than when he left, he decides to put what he learned to action. Steadily recruiting allies, he builds the Batman bit by bit, using technology that is realistic (unlike the Marvel movies), discovers a cave underneath the mansion, and sets up his base. Tech support is provided by Lucius Fox, a brilliant Morgan Freeman, an old friend of Wayne's father who has been relegated in the Wayne Corp by its current chief. Old sweetheart Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) is now ADA, and willing to stand against organized crime. The honest cop, Sgt Gordon, is skeptical but wiling to take a chance. More than an hour into the movie, the Batman finally appears, in a claustrophobic fight sequence, after terrifying a bunch of smugglers like a slasher-movie villain. Theatricality and deception, taught well by Ducard, as crime boss Falcone, who for some reason has personally arrived on the scene, is legitimately terrified out of his mind, and is caught and chained to a floodlight for the police to find at the scene of the crime. The Batman has arrived. As he moves through the darkness, he is every bit as frightening to the criminals as we are of the criminals. Christian Bale does a great job, using just his mouth, chin and jaw to convey rage, power and ruthlessness. But in the light, he appears as a man in a costume, as human as any other, making his mistakes along the way as the legend of the Bat grows. Loyal Butler Alfred, played with gleeful joy by Michael Caine, provides guidance and witty retorts as Bruce Wayne settles in his role as protector of the city at night and playboy during the day. But more threats are coming. The final third is as enjoyable as what came before, which includes a mass rioting scene, the full use of Batman's technology and cooperation of his allies, and the biggest and most enjoyable set piece involving the Monorail. The Batman is the most compelling character in his own movie, which is something superhero leads don't often get to say about themselves. This deep examination into fear, guilt, loss, responsibility to society and ethics is served wonderfully by the great writing and screenplay, which is augmented by the superb cast wonderfully directed by Nolan. VERDICT 8.5/10 STRAY OBSERVATIONS What a cast. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, supported by Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson and Cilian Murphy? God damn. Batman Begins remains a refreshing take on superhero origin stories, even almost 15 years later. This movie is a triumph of cinema. I am sure there are aspects of movie-making I missed, which Nolan and co executed wonderfully, because I was so engrossed in the experience.",neutral,5,tt0372784
"The movie pretends danger exists, but it's all choreographed, predictable, and overly polished. The hero's struggles feel theoretical, the supporting characters lack real depth, and the city's ""threats"" are hollow. The film tries to make every beat dramatic, but it reads like a boardroom exercise rather than actual survival or policing. Purely unrelatable and flat. 1/10.",negative,1,tt0372784
"The main reason i'm giving this movie 1/10 is because this one doesn't deserve the current rating that it has(at the moment of writing this is 8.6, I would refer to other current movie ratings at the moment of writing this review). A rating of 8.6 means that this movie is as good as The matrix(8.7), Saving private Ryan(8.6), Memento(8.5), Interstellar(8.6) and also that it is better than Mr. Nobody(7.9) and Synecdoche, New York(7.5), etc. This is the result of a movie with lots of fans who don't have any idea how to rate a movie and usually haven't seen much. at the most I would give this movie a 5.3, it is not so bad and it's enjoyable not memorable. Too many jokes and this is not a comedy, it doesn't seem to have a script not giving a chance for the actors to actually act. In the movie they combine cinematography of some of the other movies related to this franchise, so in some instances the quality drops really low to the point you feel as if you're watching a really bad TV series, most CG effects are on point and sometimes not(the hulk buster). I personally don't understand who would give a score of 10/10 or 9/10 so easily to a movie no one will remember next year.",negative,1,tt4154756
"The story had huge potential, no doubt about that. Unfortunately, for about the first 65% of the movie, it feels like we're just being introduced to the world over and over again. I understand that setup is important, but it was honestly way too slow. The first hour and a half felt repetitive - as if the movie keeps explaining what you already understood long ago. It was my first time watching The Matrix, and I didn't expect anything extraordinary. I was hoping for an average sci-fi film, but sadly, it turned out to be below average. There are a lot of illogical moments, and overall it feels too simple for such a promising concept. Maybe the sequels explore the ideas better, but I'm rating this film on its own - and I didn't enjoy the time I spent watching it. The acting is mostly fine, though some characters really ruin scenes with awkward facial expressions or forced jokes. I honestly can't recommend this movie to others. It's weak and often boring. I think the film's high rating mostly comes from nostalgia for its time, not from its actual quality. My rating: 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0133093
"Welcome to Braveheart, the Prequel! The similarities to Braveheart are *uncanny*! In fact, the only real differences between this and Braveheart (aside from the time period) are that Braveheart has a better script, more clever dialogue, better acting, far less horribly cheezy melodrama, and *much* less spit and polish. In fact, Gladiator is *so* polished that most of it looks *beyond* fake! The tigers were so obviously CGI'd that you could see the superimposition most of the time. And the squibs were obvious as well. And the melodrama!! Don't get me started on the melodrama!!! Braveheart should've cut the last 10 minutes you say? Gladiator should have cut the last half hour! Horribly cheezy death scenes followed by some of the worst schlock I've *ever* seen. His buddy burying his little figures as he meets his dead wife and child in the recurring wheat field dream-zone. I feel *something* rising inside of me, but believe me it's not tears... Phoenix was awful and unconvincing (he should watch a few of his late brother's films to learn a couple of things about acting...) and Russell Crowe is so far behind his role in LA Confidential that he's barely worth mentioning...which is frightening, because save for the always fabulous Oliver Reed's too small role, Crowe was actually a standout. Ridley, Ridley, Ridley, what are we to do with you?? First White Squall, now this??? Come one now! And get over the lightning already!! And the pacing!!! OUCH!! It's slow, it's fast, it's slow, it's fast, it's an action film, it's a melodrama, it's an action film...Make up your bleeding mind!! Pacing was horrid! And most of those slow-paced scenes dragged on *way* too long... Admittedly, *some* of the cinematography and sets were amazing (as is usual for Ridley Scott) but most was much less than I'd expect from one of the greatest scenic directors in modern cinematic history. Even aside from all of the hype, this film needed to chop off at least 30-40 minutes, ease up on the too-special special effects and get itself a decent cast. Oscar my butt! My advice? Save yourself two and a half hours and go see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon instead...or Braveheart...each has everything this doesn't. 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0172495
"Maybe it's OK. But is it a good movie? Let alone a good batman movie? By no means. It's a dark movie. Supposedly they had a screening of Blade Runner before starting to shoot, but ask yourselves: Is this anywhere near Blade Runner Quality? If your answer is ""yes"" then you didn't see the same movie I saw. Batman movies live and die by the acting capability of batman and the villain(s) and lets face it: Christian Bale is a pretty bad batman - only slightly better than Kilmer and a little worse than Clooney (and both were horrible at it). Where is the inner conflict? Where is the near insanity that Keaton betrayed so perfectly? The near-self destructiveness that Villains like Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer)? Where is the multi-dimensionality of the characters like The Joker (Nicholson)that has made Batman movies higher quality than Superman drivel? Arguably these actors set a pretty high gold standard as batman figures go, but if you can't play in their league then don't try. No, Bale is just a pretty face with next to no acting ability. Michael Caine could outact this guy with his head in a paper bag and all four limbs tied behind his back. Now on to the villains: After I left the theater I had already forgotten what their names were. That's a pretty bad sign. Liam Neeson can act better than this. He just warmed up his Qi-Gon Jinn routine from the Star wars flop. Not good enough - by a long shot. The girl? Don't even ask. She was just thrown in there as an addition for some T&A. Can you spell 'superfluous'? I know the director/writers can't. The effects were OK, that's why I will give this a 3/10 (The car was a bit over the top, though. That's not a batmobile, that's something you can pass off in a war movie). Summary: Not worth my money, not worth my time (not even on DVD)",negative,3,tt0372784

Of course he got two Oscars (1 for actor, 1 for best foreign film.) This was the story of a Father who is protecting his son in Nazi's Death camp, by being creative! It seems to be a war movie through the eyes of a Charlie Chaplin! If you miss this, you will miss much of romantic drive, much of humour, much of feel! I can say- You will love it!

"Refusing to spend any money to see this movie, I had to wait nearly 3 years until it premiered on TV. Seeing as this had made it to the infamous Bottom 100, I sadly consider this movie to actually be a useful tool for calibrating one's rating scale. But *only* for that purpose, not for entertainment. Truly, they don't come any worse than this. Even at 84 minutes, this movie struggles to fill its runtime. When the ""parody"" of 300 is over and the end credits start running, this is still barely over 70 minutes, so they add all the alternate and abandoned scenes to the end! These clunkers are so bad I cannot even imagine what horrors they have included as DVD/Blu-ray extras... One always hears the words ""I did not laugh a single time during that load of crap"", but most often even a terrible movie elicits at least one laugh from the viewer. Now I have seen a movie during which I truly did not laugh even a single time. I did not even smile. At best, my mouth may have twitched once, but it might have been a muscle spasm. The makers of these movies should learn one simple lesson since they obviously cannot be *prevented* from making them in the first place: do NOT attempt to make parodies of money shot scenes that in the original movies cost millions of dollars. Your ""parody"" will only become even more embarrassing than it already is. I feel pity for the technical crew, whose talent was wasted on this - obviously this was done so fast and cheap that the producers couldn't afford to pay them do spend the required time to do their work properly. Even the few talented actors who appear here seem to have been ""directed"" to act their scenes only once - which is kinda ironic, considering the ""writing"" is so bad, an infinite amount of takes would not have improved the end result. Bottom line: *Believe* IMDb. This 1/10 movie should be buried into the crust of the Earth. Anyone who likes this is out of their mind. Yes, I really mean that. Argument on the ""merits"" of this movie if you like, it will only make you a bigger fool than you already are.",negative,1,tt1073498

"This is so much better than i expected. I am 45 years old, probably too old for animation movies, however i saw those astonishing reviews and i thought, why not, let's give it a try. During the first 30 minutes it was like another reviewer mentioned, ""just a kind of hip hop version of Spiderman"", i didn't love it but it was not bad so i kept watching. To my surprise, this was getting better and better. Suddenly, i was hooked. And the last 30 minutes were amazing, i had goosebumps, i felt like i was feeling when i was younger watching movies like MATRIX, almost same excitement. I can't rate it higher because i didn't love the first half. First half was crucial though, in order for the events of the second half to happen.

"A masterclass in filmmaking, Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight exceeds nearly all comparable titles in all aspects. Admittedly, for such a high-quality production, all performances aside from Heath Ledger's brilliant turn as the Joker are a bit 'meh', for lack of a better word, but really that's the only issue. No other superhero film released since then has been even remotely as compelling (no, not even The Avengers). Even if you eliminate the already eye-popping action sequences from the finished product, the movie works as a standalone crime drama. The film's soundtrack complements the movie beautifully, and is no doubt one of Hans Zimmer's best works. Ultimately, The Dark Knight sits in my top five favourite films of all time, and while I understand that film is subjective, I have a hard time understanding how anyone could even slightly dislike the movie. 9/10, highly recommend.",positive,9,tt0468569
"The epic adventures of the Corleone family: Don Vito doesn't want to get involved in drugs, because its a dirty business. This causes repercussions and sparks a war among the five families. The Godfather Phenomenon in a nutshell: people love it for Gordon Willis' exquisite indoor cinematography, the performances, the Scarface value of being able to say sentences in the Don's voice, the in-jokes (give him an offer he can't refuse, go to the mattresses), Nino Rota's iconic musical score, and the iconic scenes (the opening monologue, followed by the Don's first totally quotable speech ""you come into my house on my daughter's wedding day"", the horse's head, Sonny's sprinkler bashing in the busy street, the fruit-market shooting, the toll-way shooting, the gun in the bathroom restaurant scene, the garden fertiliser scene near the end, and the Baptism scene). There are faults in the second film: i think Fredo goes a little over the top, for instance, but the first Godfather is as close as you'll get to a perfect film. If there was a weakest link, though, it'd probably be Diane Keaton. She does bring an interesting quality to it, I agree, but it always looks like she's reading lines. Luckily, she doesn't have too many. It can be difficult to follow, due to the fact that its an adaptation of a long, elaborate book - but i think that contributes to its mystery. You always feel like watching it again to try and figure out who killed who and why. To make a great film, Coppola went back to basics, pure and simple, grande classical storytelling. He took the lessons of the masters to heart, and the result is just one of the best, most beautiful epics in the language. 10/10",positive,10,tt0068646
"It's quite rare to see anything as roughly-assembled and ridiculous as this. I mean, I love trash films/tv but this is gold standard as far as that kind of guilty pleasure is concerned. It's not just 'bad' - this movie has a real character to it. Yes, there are some waaay over-long scenes (as is common with most 'so bad it's good' movies) but here, even they helped to amplify the insane feeling of this movie. As the first ten minutes unfolded, I became slowly overtaken by a giggling fit as I began to realise just how off-piste and bad this film really was. I had to double check that it wasn't a parody. I'm so glad it isn't. It's a raw delight. So many unexpectedly awful and silly moments to remember.

It was perhaps the worst script I had heard in a very long time.  The directing was nothing memorable.  Photography was standard.  But what destroyed the movie was the acting.  Keanu Reeves was dull and totally lifeless.  Even Laurence Fishburne wasn't good(but how could he be good in such a terrible script).  There was no chemistry between any of the characters.  And overall, the movie was boring!  It hardly held my interest... 1.5/10",neutral,5,tt0133093
"The Shawshank Redemption is a cinematic triumph that earns a definitive 10/10 for its powerful narrative, exceptional performances, and enduring emotional resonance. Tim Robbins delivers a quietly compelling portrayal of Andy Dufresne, while Morgan Freeman's heartfelt and wise performance as Red anchors the story with profound humanity. Frank Darabont's direction crafts a prison drama that transcends its setting, turning it into a universal story about hope, friendship, and inner freedom. The film's message-that even in the darkest circumstances, hope can endure-continues to inspire generations of viewers. With a beautifully written script, haunting score, and flawless pacing, it stands as one of the most beloved and meaningful films in cinematic history.",positive,10,tt0111161
"I must say this is a wonderfully written movie, and is even performed better than it was written. This is the true Batman movie that was meant for the cinema, it is powerful, it is dark, it is fun, it it is full of action oriented scenes, it is the masterpiece of all the Batman films. To be honest, I never liked any of the Batman movies. Batman Returns (1992, Danny DeVito, Michael Keaten) was decent but not good. As for the rest (Batman,Batman & Robin,Batman Forever) were horribly empty of acting, the settings seemed fake, and the acting very much like a comic book (in a bad way). The characters were to over the top to the point of annoying, and at times the whole story dragged on with a worthless plot, as well some of the worst background music I've heard in a movie franchise. As you can see, my personality does not fit the comic book type. As for this movie, it was simply terrific. Christian Bale was easily the best actor in the movie, as the power of his expressions comes through flawlessly for him, a superb performance. Liam Neeson was a true and valiant performer, his use of the given words and vocabulary are spoken with unbelievable eloquence, rhythm, and the end result is success. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are wonderful supporting actors that add their experienced talent to the all ready well-made movie. Katie Holmes and Gary Oldman give even more depth to the movie. I was surprised,nevertheless happy to see Cillian Murphey to act on the American cinema, especially this movie. The British actor seems to have mastered his accent honorably, and follows his acting like he always does in good fashion. This movie was definitely the darkest of all Batman films;nevertheless it succeeds to be the greatest of them all. Christian Bale takes Michael Keatan's place as the greatest Batman, which really surprises me because I did like Keatan's performances. This film has much much depth and finally shows to every Batman fan and movie-goer how Bruce Wayne began his voyage to become Gotham City's benevolent savior. Now everybody, listen, I will go as far as to say I liked this film better than Spider-man (the once only film I considered Marvel produced well). You ask why? Christopher Nolan takes all the flaws the other directors had in the other Batman films, and portrays Batman the way he was always meant to be shown. Superman is an a super-human alien,Spiderman has spider-like senses and powers, the Fantastic Four and the Hulk and all the other mumbo-jumbo superheroes (I don't read comics sorry) have special *powers*. BATMAN is human. Batman has human weaknesses, human strengths. NOTICE THAT BRUCE WAYNE NEVER SAYS HE IS BATMAN. Nolan portrays not a superhero, but how a man lost what he thought everything his life had to offer, succumbed to anger and lust for revenge, and evolved to become a man greater than what he once was. Because we all seem to forget, Batman is a regular human-being, who goes through unimaginable odds to protect human life, no matter how corrupt. That is why we see him as a superhero in the movie. That is why Christopher Nolan did masterfully with this film like he did with Memento. If you see this movie, you will certainly be entertained. Enjoy!! 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0372784
"I'm not entirely sure, but the last time I checked, time goes forwards not backwards. This is what makes this film terrible. Christopher Nolan didn't have the foresight to edit this film in proper sequence, a rookie error. I remember in my early days of directing, I would be sitting at my Moviola and all of a sudden, the film reel would spring off the spools and into my uncoordinated, meaty arms. Next thing I knew, I had miles upon miles of film pressing down hard upon my muscle-less body. I had stay there for 2 weeks before my mum found me. In the following week, I spent the majority of my time straightening the now noodle like coagulation of film. I had already split the film up into the constituent scenes but there was no way of telling the order because during the one-man fracas, I had fallen inadvertently performed a flying triple axle dragon kick on my film projector crushing it immediately into a fine dust. Because of this, I had no other option but to just guess which scenes should go where. After stitching all the scenes together at random I had myself a film. But what to call it? There were film festivals coming up and it had to have a name and without a linear structure, the name, 'I Stab Your Balls in a Chornological Progression Over The Course of Many Scenes From Multiple Perspectives', would make no sense whatsoever. I went to the desk of the festival, film reel tucked nicely into the warm embrace of my fanny pack and when the receptionist asked the name of my film, I had a stroke of genius. Rashomon! I'll call my film Rashomon! I had no idea what it meant but it sounded nice and that sure tickled my fanny. I submitted Rashomon (which has proved to have been my magnum opus ('magnum opus' in Latin meaning 'accidentally good film' (obviously))) and it won the Palme D'or. It was the greatest day of my life and the last time I shed a tear. That's right, I am legendary film director, Akira Kurosawa. Unfortunately, as I sat in that cushy theatre in Cannes watching back my award winning film, I realised that I despised my creation. 'No film should ever be made like this ever again', I thought to myself as I hurriedly drew out a plan on the back of my hand. The plan was one sentence long and read simply: 'BURN THIS GARBAGE'. I slipped in to the projection booth, snapped the projectionist's neck and set the monstrosity ablaze. Sitting in that projection, heated by the warmth of a fire fuelled by a film that I despised, I sought to stop anyone from creating a non-chronological film in the future. Unfortunately, I died before Memento could come out so I could do nothing about it. My actions that day ended up claiming the lives of all of those viewing my film and inspiring the ending of Inglourious Basterds, whatever that is. 1/10 for the reasons I have laid out.",negative,1,tt0209144
"David Fincher is one of the most well-known and critically acclaimed directors out there right now. He's loved by audience and critics alike. I plan on watching more stuff of his, but so far I've only watched Fight Club (more than 2.5 years ago, that's why I haven't reviewed it yet) and now, of course, this one. Se7en. Se7en takes place in a bleak, nameless city, full of crime and bloodshed. Two homicide detectives, the young, freshly transferred Mills (Brad Pitt) and the older, on the brink of retirement Somerset (Morgan Freeman), are assigned to an especially gruesome murder case. As the week goes on they discover that this is much bigger than it might've seemed at first, as a case of serial murder unravels in front of them, seemingly inspired by the Christian idea of the seven deadly sins. Well, let's get to the meat of it, folks. The script of Se7en is decent - not masterful, not amazing, but it's decent. The thing that, in my opinion, elevates this script, transforms it into a memorable story that succeeded at becoming a classic in the eyes of many, is the fact that the people who have worked on this movie really, really loved it. It shows. You can see how much they cared. You can hear about it if you do a little research and read about the production of this film - everyone fought against the studio to make this movie exactly like they wanted to. But I think that, ultimately, this combination of decent script with good, talented production crew results in, well, style over substance. There's some substance, sure, but I don't feel like the philosophical ideas presented there have given me food for thought - there's nothing truly moving or groundbreaking there, there isn't raw emotion, there isn't a deep feeling that I'm watching an emotionally loaded human story, not consistently at least. But still, even without being that deep, like I said, there IS some substance. This movie revolves around the idea of tolerance, of turning away, of people who choose to ignore suffering or wrongdoings because it's just easier. The movie deals with this conflict between our desire for a better world to live in, and our apathy towards it after being desensitized by it, in a memorable, stylish way, but it's still very simple. Not to the point of being bland, but to the point of, well, just not having enough impact on me. Same goes for the characters, except maybe for the murderer (whose character I liked quite a bit) - every character works well enough to drive this story, but neither Mills, Somerset or, I don't know, Tracy, feel interesting enough for me to want more of them, to want to explore their character. But like I said, the style is there, for sure. The cast is great, to the point that even the side characters (the guy who was telling the story in the interrogation room was so good) feel like they were treated with much care and respect. There are many great stills and memorable visual moments in the movie, and Fincher definitely deserves the credit there. Especially when it comes to apartment 604 or to the murder scenes, I feel like despite not seeing murders happening on screen they still burn into your mind because they're made with a lot of attention to detail, and they're made to have a lot of shock value. Kudos to the production designers and the set designers too, by the way. They did a really great job here, and again, just caring so much for the project always elevates it, at least somewhat (a cool example: the notebooks that we see on the opening credits and also later on, at least the pages that appear on screen, are really filled with relevant text and not just a lorem ipsum type of deal). This is part of the reason I was a bit disappointed by the film - every single time I came across a still from Se7en it looked so, so cool. But still, like I said - the style over substance type of deal here is just the reality, in my opinion, and it doesn't mean that the movie is bad. It doesn't need to be the deepest film ever to be entertaining, cool or memorable. It is what it is, and it's pretty good. Like, there's enough substance so the film won't be hollow, and enough style to cover for the lack of substance, you know? Also, it might feel weird that I mention that, but I really love the opening credits to this film. The remix of Nine Inch Nails' Closer (this song goes so hard) fits so well with both the themes and the vibe of this movie, and the montage there has so many hidden details that just pop up when you do a rewatch. Also, the way they chose not to mention a specific actor there, but only in the end credits, is really smart. It's dark, it's eerie, it has some horror vibes. Good stuff, really. Overall, Se7en is a pretty good movie. It's a case of style over substance, sure, but there's enough substance so it won't be hollow, and enough style to cover up for the lack of substance. Decent script that got put on the screen by people who truly, wholeheartedly loved it, and it shows. It was a cool watching experience. Feeling a 7.2/10 on this one.",negative,2,tt0114369
"This is a more of a ballsy sequel with a more adult humor that is in your face. But the first Harold and Kumar is better than this one, the first one just worked for the most part despite all the random situation. It's not a movie you can take your kids to watch for sure, I saw an adult with two kids just walk out a few minutes into this movie in the theater. But these kinda movies are for adults so that is fine but sometimes the jokes felt a bit too forced at times. It just seemed like the movie just seemed to be pushing the limit with adult humor and it seemed a bit too focused on that to try and make it flow in a hysterical manner. But it just wasn't as funny for the most of the way through, it's interesting because of the shock humor but that is about it for the most part. The first Harold and Kumar although random most of way through was engaging because the direction flowed pretty well but that isn't really the case for this sequel. There is also more stereotypical and sexual and toilet humor this time but I didn't really find the movie all that funny as the original. Yeah it has some shock humor than and there but this time it seems to really just rely on the shock humor aspect without it flowing very well. Some reviewers say you can't really compare the previous movie to this one, but I personally think you really can since it's a stoner comedy once again with bunch of random things happening in between like the previous movie. If your drunk while watching this with a couple of friend it might be more funny and entertaining than it really is. Don't get me wrong this isn't a bad comedy, in fact it does have it's moments but it just isn't a great one that I personally could watch again and again later along the line. But for the first watch, it's a alright stoner comedy but nothing great. I give the movie props though but having some clever comedic parts revolving the comedic duo, although very few. At least the first one had scenarios that connected with each other, that isn't the case this time around. Anyways to get the full enjoyment out of this movie, be with a group of friends and get drunk while watching or something. Even when sober it's still a alright stoner comedy to watch but like I said nothing all that great, unless your really into shock humor. Plus the situations in this movie is just way too over the top ridiculous like South Park, but South Park is a cartoon show and a TV show at that. But as a movie this one just comes off as mediocre. 6.4/10",negative,4,tt0481536

"The Wolf of Wall Street is a satirical drama comedy film that's based on Jordan Belfort's autobiography of the same name, a story about a young and promising New York stockbroker who runs a firm that engages in securities fraud and corruption on Wall Street in the 1990s. First and foremost, it is to say that the film is not everyone's cup of tea for sure, due to its moral ambiguity, sexual content, vulgarity, presence of drugs and alcohol. We are shown, through Belfort, the dark, 'fucked-up' side of the world, in all its glory. Jordan Belfort is a smart crooked bastard. His depravity knows no bounds. Armed with an amazing 'gift of persuasion' in sales and a mind filled with various illegal financial strategies that allows him to earn huge commissions on selling useless penny stocks, makes millions upon millions during his day in the 90s, which leads him to a life of drugs, alcohol, prostitutes. He constantly speaks about money and the power it buys, the 'American Dream', his seemingly noble ideals, but the truth is that he is as vain, greedy, superficial, materialistic as they come. The film glorifies the excessive lifestyle it depicts, yet it is disturbingly fun to watch his indulgence in doing drugs and women in broad daylight, divorce his first wife who stood by him in difficult times for the seductive Naomi and the constant yearning to possess more money. Despite his terrible personality, Jordan still manage to win you over, due to Leonardo DiCaprio's charming, powerful and magnetic performance, who effortlessly unleash a kind of on-screen charisma that's proved to be quite difficult to hate. The casting of Margot Robbie as the sexy, gorgeous and vivacious Naomi Lapaglia, Jordan's second wife was perfect, especially the scene when Naomi spreads her legs open and tells Jordan he won't be getting sex any time soon, with Jordan seemingly begging to want it, only to learn that she is in full view of a security camera in the end is simply awesome. The running time of the film is close to 3 hours, the movie does feel a bit stretched despite its brilliant pacing and good story and character development. Overall, while some people will disagree with me on this, The wolf of wall street is an awesome film...a masterpiece of its own. It is a film that shows how easily, quickly and thoroughly the path of dreams can be corrupted beyond reckoning. Rating: 8.5/10",neutral,5,tt0993846
"'Hardcore Henry (2016)' is an interesting experiment, an action film told entirely from the first-person perspective. At times, it provides a unique kind of entertainment you won't find pretty much anywhere else. It's admirable what the team behind the picture were able to achieve with their limited budget and camera restrictions. Some of the already elaborate stunt work is made even more impressive when you realise that the performer(s) for the eponymous 'Henry' couldn't wear a safety wire due to the 360 degree view required for the camera to seamlessly navigate through the sequences. The video-game feel - which is bolstered by several clichés, such as a silent protagonist and 'tutorial' moments -can lead to some frustration as it just seems like you're watching someone else play when you'd rather take the controls yourself. The outlandish plot and mile-a-minute pacing, along with the constrained camera-view, do get tiresome quickly, too. As such, this as an interesting movie worth a watch once for its surface value, but not much more. Plus, it is likely to cause some motion-sickness if that's something you suffer from, and maybe even if you don't. 6/10.",neutral,6,tt3072482

"I managed to solve the ""mystery"" of this film was fairly quickly... not quite first scene ""Shutter Island"" quickly, but within the first half of the film i managed to figure it out. There's then black and white scenes which play in order in a different timeline. ~~~ I get WHY it was pieced together like this, but oh my it made for an excruciatingly boring viewing. Having to watch the same scenes multiple times when we've just seen it, stretches this 40 minute film into almost two hours. We have one timeline where it's in colour, and playing backwards. So each scene (in colour) is before the previous coloured scene. However, at the end of most coloured scenes, it plays part of the previous coloured scene. I managed to solve the ""mystery"" of this film was fairly quickly... not quite first scene ""Shutter Island"" quickly, ~~~~~ Overall, 5/10. An okay film which I'd probably enjoy on second viewing; something I very rarely do. But didn't really enjoy it much at all. We have one timeline where it's in colour, and playing backwards. So each scene (in colour) is before the previous coloured scene~~~ There's then black and white scenes which play in order in a different timeline.

"15 years after first seeing this, it jumps from a middling 5/10 to a very good 8/10. The first watch was on a small screen, I judged it forgettable, sloggy and overly dour tho' with some engaging moments. This time I was able to fully immerse myself in the production - thanks to movie-watching on the gigantic virtual screen of pancake-lensed VR headsets, and Ai-software having developed to the point of meaningfully converting 2D videos to 3D. This concentrated immersive form of viewing allowed me to better appreciate The Dark Knight (rewatched last week, jumping from a good 7/10 to an excellent 9/10). And now I more value what the film-makers did here with Batman Begins: tidy narrative, interesting antagonists, solid action, and some nice wit to balance the seriousness. The film actually has fine pacing second-time round, ended well. Music is a bit bland and aimless, mind. We do get strong dialogue with a mostly decent cast. Personally I find Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman & Michael Caine's characters a little too archetypal...and Katie Holmes's Rachel too. I prefer Maggie Gyllenhaal's take, she felt more like a real person (tho' it is weird having different actors play the same character within the same trilogy). However the meat of the movie: Christian Bale & Liam Neeson, are both impressive. Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow offers some further magnetism. Next stop: Dark Knight Rises. That was initially a 7/10 on my only watch back in 2012/13 on a small screen. I expect that will also improve.",neutral,5,tt0372784
"Fight Club is one of the best movies ever made. Period. I know that is probably the greatest compliment a movie can receive, but it is absolutely true. I first saw the movie about 3 weeks ago, and I thought it was awesome, but nothing spectacular. Then, as time went on, I found myself thinking about it more and more...and now, today, I realize is just a masterpiece. There is something about the flow of the story, the amazing editing and cinematography, the shocking twist, and the deep message that makes you realize this movie is so well done and so entertaining that it really is just one of those amazing movies. I don't mean to sound harsh with my review but Fight Club is just moving. It is so much deeper than what it appears to be. It is just amazing...and it is very funny as well. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0137523

Al Pacino really stood out among the cast members. The way he portrays a man's slip into madness is pure gold. The soundtrack is iconic, catchy, and it fits the movie perfectly. This piece of cinema is only second to The Seven Samurai by Akira Kurosawa in my book. Not only that, but the writing is perfect! The dialogue is unlike almost anything seen before at the time. You feel as it you get to know the characters of this film in real life! This gets an obvious 10/10 and recommendation from me. You MUST watch this movie! It will change your perspective on the art of cinema.",positive,10,tt0068646
"Batman Begins is a tale of redemption. It is not a tale of the noble hero overcoming all odds to save ""everyone"". Bruce Wayne is damaged, but not in a way that prevents himself from accomplishing his goals. Bruce Wayne knows deep down what is expected of him. Bruce Wayne has the capacity to instill hope by making himself larger than life--as the Batman. Yes, some aspects of the movie are a little clumsy--Katie Holmes is the 15-year-old--oops, I meant 26. Assistant DA. Police Officer Gordon needed a little more screen time for me to understand his point view completely. But you know-as a comic book brought to life- director Chris Nolan did a HELL of a job using every character wisely and to some useful purpose. The dialogue wasn't Shakespeare, but I am old enough to remember some pretty wooden performances & dialogue in the original Star Wars[1977]-and look how that movie did! The witty commentary from Michael Caines' Alfred was lively and well-timed to help move the plot or make emotional connections to the audience rooting for the strong-willed & somewhat anti-hero. Christian Bale is quite good as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He may seem somewhat detached emotionally, but that is what the Batman is. Batman internalizes. He is not a well-rounded Superman/Captain Marvel character. He isn't a teenage Spiderman. He is an introspective adult, with the sadness of a family lost, with the competitive edge of a man who knows he can win if he just out-escalate the crooks around him. I would go see this movie again. 8.5/10, actually.",neutral,5,tt0372784
"I never specifically asked for this film. In fact, it was bought for me, with money left over from buying 'The Shining'. But am I ever glad it was bought for me. This is really great stuff. A dark rain-soaked city gave it style, superb performances by Morgan Freeman as a burned out veteran, and by Brad Pitt as hot-shot David Mills gave it creditable performances. John Doe was suitably chilling, and the plot unfolded brilliantly. A few people say that the gore should have been cut back, but this is something I disagree with. Not because I'm a gore-hound, but the scenes of almost untamed brutality injected the horror of the whole situation into the stylish surroundings. The sloth victim in particular. A whole year.... There are some minor gripes however. I felt that the majority of time was spent on the first three victims, then the rest of them were slightly rushed through. At the end car ride, I was still guessing how exactly it was going to end. When the box made an appearance though, I knew straight away what was in it, although I didn't know how Mills would react until he did. Lastly, and this is nothing to do with the actual film itself, but I am positively baffled by people who say that it frightened them, and that it was scary. This film was very atmospheric, and at times, it was somewhat edgy. But scary? Don't make me laugh. Anyway, a superb modern horror. 9.5/10 - Highly recommended.",neutral,5,tt0114369
"Another adaptation of Henry James' The Turn of the Screw. There have been good ones, and not so good; sadly, this is one of the latter. Director Floria Sigismondi gives the impression of having seen James Watkins' The Woman in Black and James Wan's The Conjuring, without actually understanding what makes them work. A director can have all the CGI, all the dimly lit corridors, all the barely glimpsed figures in the world - but if they don't have 'an eye for the creepy' it doesn't work. Chilling ghost stories that get under your skin are hard to do. Every flesh-creep has to be earned; they won't come automatically just because you've turned the lights down and put an out of focus figure in the background. As for the cast, young leads Finn Wolfhard and (especially) Brooklynn Prince are very good, and Barbara Merten (as the house keeper) is excellent. Mackenzie Davis' governess on the other hand is annoying and remarkably ineffectual. Killruddery House in County Wicklow, Ireland, is a suitably spooky location - but it's wasted here. I recommend watching Jack Clayton's classic The Innocents, or Mike Flanagan's The Haunting of Bly Manor mini-series instead. 4/10.",negative,4,tt7510346
"One word: Amazing. Not much to say besides that. Christopher Nolan brings us a new Batman against joker story that takes the title for best. The idea that Batman can't do anything. The idea that joker is the best criminal. Heath Ledger was amazing. You're on the edge of your seat the entire time. There are only two things I'm complaining about and that stopped me from rating it a 10. 1. When Batman is going to save Rachel, he could've saved both by sending teams out each way to each location, but he didn't. Why? 2. Harvey Dent blames Batman for the death of Rachel. Why? He knows perfectly well that Batman is at least trying to be the hero here. So when Batman tells him to point the gun at the people responsible, why the heck does he point it at Batman?? Otherwise, this film is, if not the best, one of the best films Nolan has brought us. 9/10.",positive,9,tt0468569
"David Fincher is one of the best directors in Hollywood today. This is his finest film. Based on the best selling book of the same name, the movie starts with the narrator,Edward Norton initially a nameless, boring drone leading a shallow, meaningless life as just another cog in the great corporate wheel. He spends his time buying sofa-sets and basically indulging in the huge facade that is today's materialistic and fake society. As he puts it: ""We used to read pornography, now it's the 'Horchow Collection'.""But he isn't satisfied with his life. There's always this nagging feeling, deep-down, a hint of discontent. This manifests into his psyche and he becomes an insomniac. Seeking medication, he discovers therapy groups, and there, on the pretext of a terminal disease or an addiction, he cries. He doesn't really know why he crying. Maybe its about the hollowness, and the utter futility of it all. This daily discharge helps him sleep. Until, that is, chain-smoking, messed-up Marla Singer starts coming to his therapy sessions for a similar purpose. Seeing another 'tourist' there bursts the happy he finds himself in and insomnia creeps back into his life. Then he meets Tyler Durdan and he's drawn, like everyone else, to his magnetic personality. One night, on a whim, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. He complies, and thus begins fight club. Fight club transformed into a nocturnal activity in a basement where men shed the inhibitions laid down by society, and release themselves. That's all that I'm going to reveal here. But let's talk about Tyler Durdan. For it's not possible to talk about fight club and not talk about Tyler Durdan, a character who was recently named the greatest movie character of all time by a magazine, beating out competition from the likes of Darth Vader, Hannibal Lecter, The Joker, John Rambo etc. Brad Pitt outdoes himself in portraying just about the best example of an alpha-male you'll ever see. Tyler epitomises the saying about Bond (""Man want to be him, Women want to sleep with him"") more than any Bond. The rugged Daniel Craig, the cool suave and sophisticated Brosnan and Connery all fall flat in front of his sheer charisma. His laid-back, casual attitude tells of a man who has not a care in his life. The conviction with which speaks tells of a man who's got it all figured out. His radical thoughts and ideas tell of a fearless man, not afraid to go against society. And the small, condescending smile he occasionally afforded the narrator tells of a man who knows just how superior he is to everyone. Tyler Durdan acts the saviour of the society's repressed men and frees them from its clutches. Edward Norton too, does a brilliant job as the narrator, and his boring drawl as a narrative paradoxically draws you further in the movie. The narrator the quintessential modern man trying to find meaning who is swayed by forceful personality. The dialogues are smart and some of the lines have now achieved cult status and are often quoted to each other by today's hippys. The cinematography is completely in sync with the somewhat non-linear storyline and is so good that it somehow distracts most watching it for the first time (including me) from a very obvious truth which makes you feel really stupid afterwards. Because of this, Fight Club, has, for most of the stupid audience (which constitutes an incredibly large number of us) and also the ones who think they're too smart (the rest of us), a huge twist that leaves you gasping, adding to its excellent plot. In addition to the twist, the plot aptly puts a mirror to society. While the anti-consumerism propagated has been aptly covered by most reviewers, something that they missed was the movie showing how fickle and susceptible to propaganda the human population is, and who easily they get swayed in search of meaning. The film does tickle the fancies of many, despite the film's anarchistic messages being tempered down with wry humour. Fight club preaches about evolving beyond the endless pursuit of perfection by today's superficial society. Fight Club is about showing on your face what other people hide in their closets. Fight Club is about exposing the dirty underbelly that every household inevitably has. But it also preaches against taking its own ideas too extremely. But above all, it entertains. It is more than two hours of intense entertainment. For all those who haven't seen Fight Club, go watch it right now! 9/10",positive,9,tt0137523
"I can only hope that Tolkien isn't turning over in his grave after watching this movie from wherever he might be. I should begin with the disclaimer that I didn't dislike this movie because of its deviations from the book. Peter Jackson has performed a small miracle condensing a 400+ page book into three hours, so alterations to the plot were acceptable. That being said, Fellowship of the Ring was a terrible ACTION movie. In an of itself it was entertaining enough, in the same way that Armageddon or Independence Day are entertaining movies. But the fact that this movie graces the top 100 movies (IMDB) of all time is ridiculous, if not laughable. To put this movie, an ACTION movie, in the same category as Schindler's List, The Godfather, or The Shawshank Redemption is an absolute tragedy and mockery of objective film criticism. My main criticism is simply that this movie in no way analyzed the complex characters and character relationships so vividly depicted in Tolkien's books. In fact, hardly any characters were developed at all. And not only were the characters not explored, but in their stead was substituted pathetic things like an attempt to incorporate a Hollywood-ized love scene between Aragorn and Arwen that didn't exist in the first book, and was not even acknowledged until the third book (and in hardly the detail). The plain fact is that this movie was an ACTION movie, and by no means does it deserve an IMDB rating above a 7. Don't get me wrong, it was a good ACTION movie, but by no means excellent. So in my vain attempt to offset the myriad of obviously myopic viewers that have voted 10 for this movie, I give it a 1/10.",negative,1,tt0120737
"I really like the movie that was temporarily #1 - ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". I agree with a lot of what's in the charts though think some films here are over-rated. And this is what I felt about ""The Godfather"". It's very well made, etc. but it's also a bit boring. On a production level, it's hard to fault ""The Godfather"" and Coppola's handling of events. There's an intense level of detail, as he charts the rise of Vito Corleone to prominence, and the lengths people go to attain power. The direction is great - there's a real sense of epic-ness here. The city and times seem alive before you. There's a great sense of realism - helped, for example, by the use of speaking Italian in the movies because - hey Hollywood - not everyone would want to, or choose to, constantly speak English. It's rich and lush and has a quality nearly all films lack nowadays in their haste to please the lowest-common-denominator. The acting is spot on. In fact it's probably above that. It's excellent. Pacino is at his height here - wonderful as the naive Michael Corleone who has to learn the family trade. Marlon Brando's ""Vito Corleone"" has become so infamous that seeing him is almost like watching a caricature (as are many of the lines) but he's on fine form, though I preferred his fresher, more engaging role in ""On the Waterfront"". And yet for all the unquestionable production values and acting... I found it all a tad dull. I don't have an aversion to the genre - ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Sopranos"" are superb - but I found the pacing slow, almost monotonous in places. There is an attention to detail, and an epic scope, but that doesn't necessarily translate to interesting viewing. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" dragged me into the sweeping sands, yet I wasn't dragged in here to anything approaching the same degree. There's character development but, as we touch up and down upon certain moments in the lives of the Corleones, we're never given any sense of more fluid developments. We see their actions from a distance and find it harder to empathise or care about them. It all adds up to a muted viewing experience for me, and I felt indifferent to his hailed classic. I can't knock ""The Godfather"" too much, because it has a lot going for it. As one reviewer commented it, even those who don't like it feel forced to rate it highly because they must acknowledge the craftsmanship here. For all that I was quite disappointed by this movie and can only give it 8/10 (and that's because of the talent involved). The ""sequel"" was better, but not by much.

The crazy doctor is basically a douche and looks like one as well, his face is freakishly gross looking as well and has zero charisma. So basically none of the characters were interesting to watch, most of them are retarded and the characters actions didn't make sense a lot of times and the movie has a lot of plot holes.

Ever since Batman Begins, and the way it ended with the joker card and Batman saying ""I'll look into it."" I was like ""They have to make a sequel!"". And nothing for 2 year...until May 2007, my prayers were answered. My friend told me of something about a new Batman movie in May, I researched, and found the website: (Whysoserious.com). Yes I may sound like a nerd, but I did go on the scavenger hunts looking for the teaser trailers and the posters and photos of the Joker. Then in 2008 with only 7 months to go, hearing all about the production, and Heath Ledger being the Joker, getting so hyped. On January 22, while watching the news, bad news darkens my day. Heath Ledger (April 4, 1979 - January 22, 2008) died of accidental overdose, I did not live for that day, a fantastic actor whose life was cut short sadly. After all the sadness, July 18 finally came along. I saw the The Dark Knight at Cinemark at 7:45 pm Opening night (I was not lucky enough to get my tickets for Thursday 12:00. The Dark Knight has to be the most incredible film I have seen this year. I surpasses Batman Begins in every aspect! (Batman Begins is a great film, The Dark Knight is just wayy better) Every little thing about it was fantastic!! The editing, the direction, the cinematography, the score, the effects, the acting. The acting, Heath Ledger put on the best performance I have ever seen put on film. Aaron Eckhart was just as great as Heath was! Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Maggie Gynllenhaal (who was a great replacement) all did fantasitc. I really have to give the standing ovation to Heath Leger, he did the absolute best in this film. Rest in peace Heath, you are missed. Two warnings about seeing this, It is really long 152 mins (2 1/2 hrs) so don't quibble, noting seems to slow down at all. The other warning is that, parents don't take your children that are younger than 12 years old. The Joker is quite scary, and the way he kills people is very disturbing, how he got the cuts is explained. The Dark Knight really is the best film of 2008!

I really wanted to like this film but it didn't touch me the way like it did with most other viewers.  I must agree with a comment made earlier by Andrew Campbell that the first half was entertaining but the second half which took place in the concentration camp was a disappointment to me. I can't really tell you why but the whole thing seemed a little ridiculous to me. I'm not saying it's a bad film. I just think this film is over estimated. Everyone is saying that's it beautiful how the father is trying to protect his child. That the message of this film is so positive and that we can learn from it. I must agree that Benigni's intentions are beautiful but that does not mean that this is one of the better films ever made just because the message is so positive.  But it seems that I am one of the few who thinks that way.  I found this an average film and give it 5/10.,neutral,5,tt0118799
"I could do an in-depth review of Shawshank, but I wouldn't be breaking any ground. It's the highest rated movie on this site, and is often considered the best movie of all time, and that's for a DAMN good reason. It was no accident this movie has gained such accolades, I suspect the people giving it very low ratings have to be to try and be tanking it so The Godfather or another movie can take its place, or they're trolling. If you give this movie less than a 9/10, you're simply, categorically wrong. I wouldn't even trust a person who would give this movie a 1 or a 2, nor would I respect their opinion of literally anything. The trashiest take of trashiest takes. It came out a few years before I was born, and I don't think there's been a better movie made since, nor was there one made before it. This movie will inspire you and give you hope, and has the best payoff in movie history. It's raw, perfectly written, and there's no wasted scenes. It will make you afraid of prison, hopeful for the future, and grip you from beginning to end. The acting, writing, pacing, humanization, etc, literally everything about this movie is sublime. I'd even go so far as to say it's one of the best pieces of media and art ever created, let alone the best piece of cinema. If you haven't seen The Shawshank Redemption, do yourself a favor and stop whatever you're doing and watch it, because other than maybe having a child or getting married, it is highly unlikely that whatever it is you're doing at present isn't as good as watching Shawshank for the first time.",positive,9,tt0111161
"I watched ""The dark knight"" in an IMAX theater in Houston last summer. Like many others who have seen the dark knight I would describe the film in one word: Wow. It was incredible. The movie went quickly to the top of my Netflix account so I was able to watch it again immediately after its DVD release. unfortunately (or fortunately) I have not seen any other Batman movies before so Batman was not my hero when I first saw the film. The story, however, does not require any background to masterfully make you fall deep into the stream of Gotham city events. The movie begins strongly, progresses constantly and ends amazingly. There are five actors at their best performances in this movie. Christian Bale (Batman), Heath Ledger (Joker), Gary Oldman (James Gordon), Michael Caine (Alfred), and Morgan Freeman (Fox). Other actors and actresses are also good. Although I think that Rachel's role deserved a much better actress than Maggie Gyllenhaal. The cinematography and music is excellent. Although you may need to watch the movie in an IMAX theater to fully acknowledge it. It was one of the best movies that I've seen in years. I won't be surprised if the movie wins 8 Oscar awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor in a Leading Role (Bale), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Ledger or Oldman, God that's a difficult choice), Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound Editing. 9/10",positive,9,tt0468569
"I hated this movie!!!!! It was dark, gloomy, repetitive and uninteresting. I thought I would probably not love it based on the trailer but still expected more from a Martin Scorsese film. I am not sure why it is getting such rave reviews; it really surpasses me what people saw in it. The thriller is set in the 1950's, with Leonardo DiCaprio interpreting a U.S. Marshal, and Mark Ruffalo as his partner. Together they are investigating the disappearance of a dangerous inmate from an insane asylum on the very isolated Shutter Island. The atmosphere and music are ominous from the start, much like the opening scenes of Scorsese's 1991 Cape Fear. It rains constantly on Shutter Island and the decor is conveniently populated with cliffs and a towering lighthouse where a dramatic (if somewhat disappointing) plot twist later takes place. There are lots of twists and turns and psychological unraveling on the part of DiCaprio's character. He is haunted by flashbacks of scenes he witnessed of concentration camps during WW2, and visions of his murdered wife played by Michelle Williams. DiCaprio's performance was skillful and talented, as was Ruffalo's. Ben Kingsley was appropriately dramatic in his portrayal of the chief psychiatrist at the institution. The movie carried on for quite long and its ambiguous ending was not enough to redeem its exasperating, overly paranoid quality which veered too much towards the horror genre for my taste. More boring than horrifying, I give it a 3. My rating: 3/10 Fabio's: 4/10 Total score: 7/20 Please check out http://paulinasmovies.blogspot.com for more",negative,3,tt1130884

"Let me say this first, I had to watch this film twice. The first time I watched it I hated it, it was confusing. The second time I watched it I was simply awe struck. This is easily one of the greatest films ever made. Christopher Nolan has outdone himself. He has created a unique concept and adaptation that is unprecedented in film. We have never seen such creativity brought to life in such a way and executed so brilliantly. The plot is well thought of and flows well. We are introduced to a world of dreams that harbor great secrets and there exists dream explorers who have the technology to explore and steal these secrets. Never before has corporate espionage reached such unique heights. The plot intrigues, impresses and captivates. The acting was first class as well. Leonardo arguably gives his most convincing performance to date. His internal conflicts due to his wife interrupt and complicate the dream mission and the plot Nolan has introduced. Supporting cast such as Tom Hardy also give strong performances. The film includes a memorable and fantastic soundtrack that always suits the mood of the film. Great moments and scenes are included in this film, Cobb on the beach, flash backs and the beautiful Non, Je ne regrette rien which is a cue to wake up. The final scene was so uplifting and rewarding to the viewer. This film might be Nolan's finest work to date and his magnum opus. Please do not hesitate to watch it twice, it is life changing. 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt1375666
"""Clinical Trials Phase 1:"" 8.5/10. ""A Ride in the Park:"" 8.5/10. ""Safe Haven:"" 8.5/10. ""Slumber Party Alien Abduction:"" 5/10. It seems like only yesterday I reviewed the horror anthology V/H/S. The film was a likable little horror flick that focused prominently on showcasing independent filmmakers that have made noise in their respected field recently and gave us the first horror anthology film since Chillerama. It was gory, pleasant, and nostalgia thanks to its choppy aesthetic. Not even a year after the release of the original film we have V/H/S/2 (originally titled ""S-VHS,"" referencing the improved upgrade of the traditional VHS tape released in the late eighties), a slicker, broader, and a more brutal take on the idea of anthologies showcasing more talents from the independent circuit. The only returning director from V/H/S is Adam Wingard, who shot the wraparound story that encapsulating all the shorts in the original. It was only wise to overhaul the old directors in favor of newer ones to give the new franchise a broader reach. Wingard returns manning the camera and starring in the first short, titled ""Clinical Trials Phase 1,"" where he plays a man whose eye has just been replaced with a glass eye housing a camera, being one of the testers of this new technology. The doctor warns him there may be glitches in the software that will be reviewed when he submits the ""eye tape"" to the programmers. The entire short is shot through this eye camera, and shortly after he gets home we see the camera welcome in a slew of demonic entities. The story is elevated by a girl who enters the man's life, telling him he is not alone in the regard that his technology welcomes in new frights in his life and that's what gives this story the leverage it needs to succeed. The terrific POV perspective helps too, and this is a recurring theme in the film as we begin to see. Following Wingard's short is ""A Ride in the Park,"" directed by Eduardo Sánchez (The Blair Witch Project) and Gregg Hale, focusing, at first, on a biker traveling through the woods before being victim to a bunch of what-appear-to-be zombies lurking in the woods. The short, shot entirely using a Go-Pro camera mounted on the biker's helmet, shows the biker evolving into an inhuman creature, eventually attacking a birthday party and the party guests. The perspective, again, livens up a seemingly drab idea. Sánchez still knows how to utilize a woodsy setting, and the ending warrants a nice jump and a quick-shriek. Very solid piece all around. I have a feeling Gareth Evans and Timo Tjahjanto's ""Safe Haven"" will be the fan-favorite of the lot and it very well should be. This is a smart, intense thriller that could've easily been broadened and expanded to feature-film status. The short, which occupies the longest runtime at about thirty minutes, focuses on a gang of investigative journalists who explore a shady, Indonesian cult. Reciting the plot any further doesn't do much justice, as this is a short that relies heavily on tone, editing, and plot. Evans, who directed the ever-so popular The Raid: Redemption last year does big things with the atmosphere and the possibilities with ""Safe Haven,"" consistently making it taut and terrifying. It's a fan-favorite for a good reason. We end, unfortunately, on a sour note, with Jason Eisener's ""Alien Abduction Slumber Party."" Most of the short is shot from a camera mounted on the back of a small Yorkie dog (who is killed at the end for good measure) and centers around a group of friends having a party at a lake house after the parents take off, with the gang being victim to an alien invasion. An easy summation for the short is chaotic, as the editing is scrambled, shots are astonishingly disjointedly cut, and Eisener has almost no sense of placement or cohesion with the videography occurring here. Directors are usually at piece with their material and what they're shooting; Eisener is wrestling his to the point where it seems to be no fun for him or for us. The wraparound story shows two private detectives in search of a missing male college student. They enter his home, find a slew of VHS tapes, and get to work private investigating. The wraparound - like the first film - is pretty lame and sterile. There are no real scares to be found, no real jollies to be had from the characters or the events, and all it really serves as the connective tissue to three very well done shorts and one lukewarm one. V/H/S/2, as a whole, is a thoroughly amusing one, and certainly one of the better horror films of the last year. It's an exceptional rarity, as well, seeing a sequel come out less than a year after its predecessor that is equal parts more efficient and more effective. I can see this film getting better reception from viewers and critics alike, as the film follows a more quietly subversive style in terms of videography and directing, rather than the original film, which was more concerned with blunt force scares. I suppose the biggest compliment one could pay to an anthology is that the stories could be made into feature length films, and in this case, all but one passes the test. Directed by: Simon Barrett, Adam Wingard, Eduardo Sánchez, Gregg Hale, Gareth Evans, Timo Tjahjanto, and Jason Eisener.",neutral,5,tt2450186
"I was looking forward to this movie, as the blend of thriller and horror with an ultra talented Michael Fassbender is right up my ally. With that said, I gave this movie a huge length of rope; found myself trying to see the long boring, usually senseless scenes as mood building. Alas, no. So the plot goes like this. Killer who leaves a snowman as a calling card. Fassbender is a drunk cop who (theoretically) is a genius. It sounds like a good recipe for a movie. There is a bunch of other stuff thrown into the film, but I honestly can't figure out why, or how it relates to the plot. Val Kilmer is in the movie... so is J.K. Simmons... who their characters are, or why is still a mystery to me. OK, so let's give the film credit for it's cinematography. The shots of Norway are stunning. There is some good building of mood, even if it leads to nothing. Fassbender also does the very best with the role he can, but his director lets him down with abysmal pacing, directing choices. Very little about this mess is watchable. It makes no sense. It is agonizingly slow and the 'twists' are so obvious you assume they can't be. It is also disjointed, with little linking one scene to the next. As much as I want to like this movie (and I am going to book my tickets to Norway!), it is a total disaster. Watch the trailer, avoid the film. 2/10",negative,2,tt1758810
"This is my very first review and English is not my first language, so forgive me for my limited vocabulary and for my mistakes. I knew nothing about this movie before yesterday, somebody just told me it was stupid but funny and so I gave it a try. I was pleased to see two of my favorite actors (Dennis Quaid and Greg Kinnear) and I thought to myself: ""well, this is a good start"". And when Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet appeared I said ""wow, this is some great cast they got!"". Then, unexpected, the shock. And then I started laughing, and I kept laughing until the end of the first segment. Of course the rest of the movie could not shock me anymore but I did some more good laughing, which was something I just needed. This movie is not a masterpiece. It was obviously made intentionally to cross the line of decency and good taste, so I understand all the 1/10 of all those people who do not tolerate sick humor, obscenities, nudity, racist jokes and much more than this. Personally, I enjoyed it. Sometimes I just want to laugh and think of nothing. OK, do not show this to your children. If you have a bigot friend, don't call him to watch this movie with you. Do not expect a complex plot. If you enjoy only psychological or intellectual movies then don't waste your time. Just think of this movie as the result of a bet of a group of directors about who'd make the most absurd and obscene short movie. I give Movie 43 a 7/10 because it made me laugh and also because I will never see Hugh Jackman the same again!",negative,1,tt1333125
"I will rate this movie on characters/script, acting, plot, production and an x-factor. The characters in this movie have no personality or depth. Worse, because you cannot sympathise with them in any way, they add a clichéd sob story for the main character, to fill the gap left by a clinical inability to project any humanity onto him, through the use of dialogue. Score = 1/10. The acting is OK. Average. But with no characters to act, I would imagine this isn't hard. Score = 3/10. The plot is complicated (for a movie), fast paced and based on the most spurious, simplistic and quasi-scientific description of the human mind. It demands that you concentrate to keep up, so it is very disappointing to realise that your efforts are unrewarded. There are logical, philosophical, scientific and psychological flaws with every turn of the plot, and it isn't even consistent in these. This makes it a very boring movie to watch so a big fat 1/10 for plot. Production is good. Nice special effects with a big budget. 7/10. So far we have 12/40, which is 3/10. This means I would have to give -7/10 for x-factor, in order to arrive at a final score of 1/10, which is what this movie deserves, because it claims to be so much that it is not. So x-factor gets -7/10 exactly.",negative,1,tt1375666
"How this movie has to be #1 is a mystery, then I see that Lord of Rings is #5 and I understand. Just think people rated this movie #1 cause other did it. A kind of conformism. The story is completely non-sense. What's the deal in a mafia family's revenge? Good actors don't mean good movie, good director doesn't mean good movie. If the story lacks then direction and acting are worthless. This movie is BORING! There's no emotional scene in all movie, oh well if you except the horse in the bed. There's anyway some funny moments, as the way are pictured the mafia guys in Sicily, really outdated.

"Remember when the joker explains why he uses a knife instead of a gun? He prefers to savour the little details, read between the lines, appreciate the moment. As opposed to a violent, quick thrill of a gun. For me this film ended up being more like a machine gun than a knife. Let's start with the excellent aspects of this film. Strong performances - Bale is fantastic, Michael Caine and Morgan freeman always produce excellent performances and this again does not disappoint, Heath ledger is impeccable. Music score is incredible by Hans Zimmer. Cannot imagine a better soundtrack is possible for this film. Epic use of image, immersing cinematography, the make up and costume department need a raise. What's a mixed bag and what's poor . The plot - the plot is decent, but far from outstanding. It's about half an hour too long. There's certainly one chapter too many. In the last 45 mins we have hospital gate and ferry gate. You really need to choose only one there. The ferry scene paints to us what the joker is trying to prove - that when it comes down to it everyone will become selfish, save themselves before others no matter the cost. However I don't think they quite hit the nail on the head with it. The way it pans out, for me, is too unrealistic. Call it my lack of faith in human nature. I feel a more believable scenario of human heroism would've sent a stronger message. Hospital gate provides very little to the plot, except 20 mins of watching a headache. Philosophical themes and execution - Heath Ledger's acting is incredible so don't come at me, but the joker is too one dimensional. I get it, he likes chaos, but I want more depth. It may be good enough for the comics but not for a film to the caliber of this one. There's just a little too much spoon feeding dialogue. All this talk about chaos and human nature. Allow the audience to read between the lines, decifer the deeper meanings for themselves. Be a knife, not a gun. Pacing - I can't really fault the pacing until it comes to Harvey's transformation into two face. This part of the film is really poor. Even when I watched this film as a kid I was like come on. It's not even a character arc , he more or less wakes up a sadistic maniac, like Peter Parker just wakes up as spider man. Im not saying two face is a bad character, but a substantially more amount of time is necessary for us as the audience to realistically believe this transformation from hero to villain. And lastly, the film is just a bit too crash bang wallop. Just turn the volume down a little bit. Now, I admit this review focuses more on the bad than the good. I can only say that's because everyone rates this film so highly that I think the weaknesses are more relevant. It's a great film and I understand the hype. But we have to admit there are major flaws to this film. I hate the way people really brand the word about 'overrated' , I don't like using it - it makes you sound as a sort of Scrooge. However , with an IMDB rating of 9/10 I think there might be a strong case for it right here.",positive,9,tt0468569

"Not being a huge fan of superhero movies, I didn't have much expectations for Batman Begins. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch. The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene steal-er. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view. At a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive. The movie's action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the character's are intelligent and highly believable. The movie's soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes, so it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. Nolan creates a grand, dirty, engrossing world, and his action sequences just hum. In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. 10/10""",positive,10,tt0468569
"Yes, you could classify me as 'one of those Tolkien losers', but my opinion is just as valid as anyone elses'. I tried hard to blame my disappointment with this movie on me being disoriented when I saw it, or in a drunken- or stoned-like state somehow, but I have come to the conclusion that this movie really blew, especially if you have any clue what you're talking about. People, who I can only assume are too lazy to read the books, call this 'a great masterpiece of our time' and 'an instant classic', but I must negate that resolution. True, it is a subjective opinion, and true, it is an adaptation of the book, but honestly... that doesn't explain away anything in this, and people that say that 'it's jsut nerds who pay attention to that stuff' are probably insecure, and have a baseless argument. Read StumbleBee's comment on the movie to see my main issues with it, I really don't feel like repeating what's been said before. I will say what I liked about the movie, however. 1.Gollum was so-so. Much better than the Jar Jar v2.0 I dreaded when going into the movie, but not an incredible job done here. 2. Theoden and Faramir. Well cast, badly portrayed. Not the actor's fault. 3. There were parts of the movie where it felt they had strayed back on track. Some of the scenes in Itilien, before Frodo and Sam get captured, come to mind; i.e. the stuff about whether they were going to be in any songs or anything. I thought that to be very much in the spirit of the books. Patches of actual Tolkien a movie does not make. It isn't that Jackson made changesto the book, but the changes he made are what sadden me. He COULD have skipped adding in the Warg attack, Aragorn's adventure, the debate between Arwen and Elrond (though this wasn't really awful), and the trip to Osgiliath in favor of more Ent time, Entmoot, etc. Also the breaking of Saruman's staff, Shelob battle, and Frodo's capture were glossed over.

"I was at the video store with my girlfriend and we wanted to rent out a few movies. I decided that one of the films we should rent out is 'The Shawshank Redemption'. I had always wondered why it had such good ratings as well as being positioned at #2 in the IMDb Top 250, and I thought I would see just how good the movie really was. When the film concluded in a way that I would have never conceded, I sat there in front of the TV surprised and dumbfounded. When my girlfriend asked me what was wrong, I simply just said ""That....is the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life."" It was not just an ordinary and clichéd film I was watching, it was art on the screen, 2 and a half hours of extraordinary cinematography, unforgettable acting, and a plot so compelling, that you just did not want it to end. Morgan Freeman as Red and Tim Robbins as Andy are the perfect choices for their respective roles. The prison setting is so daunting and visually satisfying, while the corruption by the warden and the guards is dreadfully brutal yet extraordinarily eye popping. I normally dislike some movies that normally go for over 2 hours as I think they are just dragging on, but Shawshank along with very few others kept me glued to the screen in suspense. I hung onto every scene and every word uttered in the entire film. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is unique in its own little way, and it has affirmed my belief that hope and courage through adversity is possible and rewarding. Not many movies are made like this, and I just hope that there is a movie like, but probably not as good as, 'The Shawshank Redemption' that will be made in this hostile and cruel 21st Century.

Such movies are successful because they portrait the reality in the way people wish it to be. There are definitely many people who consider fast cars young chicks, adrenaline and all that other stuff around extremely cool. And this is a movie for them. Virtual reality, something that WOULD NOT HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE. The movie accomplished this task, no doubt about it. If you are in a target group - I would say that would be mostly men under 25 - you will probably like it. Fast cars, lot of racing scenes, dynamic music, clipish cinematography, easy-on-the-eyes chicks -  nothing important is missing. You will be attracted by the atmosphere of the movie so much, you will forgive it apparent non-senses, lame plot, dumb dialogues and unbelievability - but gosh, who cares, virtual reality does not have to be believable. All of us who expect movies to reflect reality at least to certain extent, and to portrait some aspects of life in original way, yes, we have to be disappointed. But we are not a target group.

"There appear to be two Steven Speilbergs in Cinema: Speilberg the filmaker, responsible for such films as Schindler's list and Speilberg the entertainer, responsible for films such as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Sometimes, he manages to balance out both with films such as Jaws as the result. I usually enjoy his more balanced out films, they really entertain while catching your deep thoughts. However, sometimes there's a sign of a clash between the two. In 2001's A.I. Speilberg seemed to want to have a Kubrick film yet at the same time dazzle the audience with vibrant chase sequences and harrowing visual effects. The clash usually ends up in somewhat of a mess, not neccessarly bad but not really that good either. That being said, I'll move onto the review. Catch Me if You Can is definitely a clash of Speilberg. He wants to provide the viewer with a quick and stlyish movie about one of the moust astounding criminals in the world yet also provide them with a deep, rich character study. Unfortunately, the script seems to go more with the quick aspect, providing flashy dialouge such as in Frank's Father, Christopher Walk's character. What ends up happening is a rather solid film, but it could have been a bit more. Leornado Dicaprio shines as the intelligent yet somewhat misguided Frank. He conveys his emotional moments and his excited moments effortlessly, really making the viewer think he's 17. Tom Hanks provides solid work here, but he seems to be a bit over- the- top with his character. Christopher Walken offers valuable support here, perhaps showing the route of the motivations for Frank's crime spree. With a good enough cast, this movie clicks instantly and follows through... almost till the end. Unfortunately, somewhere along the line the movie trips on it's own legs and becomes quite repeating. It ends up just being one con job aftr another, trying to inspire excitment in the viewer then get emotions out of them by showing Frank's internal dilemna. The script is solid enough and Speilberg's directing a bit unfocused but still all right. That being said, it's not that Catch Me If You Can is neccessarily a bad movie, quite the contrary really. It's an interesting $9 spent, a sort of ride yet an emotional experience. Speilberg clashes indeed, but the rest of the movie sticks together well enough. 7.5/10",neutral,5,tt0264464
"Fight Club is a film that sinks its teeth into modern masculinity, consumer culture, and existential dread, then chews them up with anarchic glee. David Fincher's direction is slick, grimy, and pulsating with raw energy - a perfect match for Chuck Palahniuk's subversive source material. Edward Norton delivers one of his best performances as the disillusioned Narrator - bored, broken, and sleep-deprived into numbness - until he meets the magnetic Tyler Durden, brought to life by Brad Pitt in a career-defining role. Tyler is chaos personified: funny, seductive, violent, and absolutely unhinged. Together, they spiral into an underground movement that starts with bare-knuckle fights and ends with something far more dangerous. Fincher's visual storytelling is incredibly dynamic, filled with clever edits, unreliable narration, and fourth-wall breaks that still feel fresh decades later. The film pulses with a sense of rebellion, a desire to feel something real in a world full of catalogs and empty routines. The twist hits hard, and rewatching it with that knowledge only deepens the themes. But while Fight Club is undeniably thought-provoking and stylish, it sometimes risks being misinterpreted by the very disaffected men it critiques. It walks a thin line between satire and glorification - and some viewers miss the point entirely. Still, that complexity is part of what makes it so enduring. 8/10 - a visceral, provocative, and endlessly quotable film that challenges the system and the self. You may not agree with Tyler Durden, but you won't forget him. The first rule of Fight Club is: you still talk about Fight Club - 25 years later.",positive,8,tt0137523

"Woah this movie was actually really good. Into The Spiderverse follows Miles Morales as he has to stop a machine that is combining dimensions, and becomes the next Spiderman. I gotta say, I was really impressed. The animation is absolutely stunning, and there's a ton of animation jokes. I'm not really gonna talk anymore about the visuals, because that's been said to death, but the movie is just gorgeous. The action was also really engaging, it's all very fast paced, and while it can get weird at times, you can still follow it with ease. For an animated film this movie was surprisingly mature in some moments, and I think that's what makes it great. I mean damn characters actually die, and there are many emotional moments. Also there's themes of divorce, depression, among others. However I don't think this movie is the best Spider-Man movie, or even an amazing movie. I do have to say this movie definitely understands the character of Spider-Man, and I love the theme of everyone can become Spider-Man. My real problem comes with some of the characters. Miles is the only character that gets significant development in the movie, and in the respect it's excellent. Miles has some really great emotional moments and Shameik Moore does a great job voicing him. In fact the whole voice cast does a phenomenal job. However apart from Miles no other character gets significant character development. I mean I get it, this is Miles movie, and they should develop his character the most, but the other characters are really 1 dimensional to me. While all the other alternate dimension Spider-Man were very entertaining, I really don't care about them. The older Spider-Man was done really well though. He does have his own little arc in the movie. He's definitely well developed. You can see he's reluctant to mentor Miles, but he knows it's the right thing, and Miles needs this. Again apart from those characters we get the most basic information of everyone else. Each character just gives their origin, and that's it. We don't know anything else about them. Those scenes were handled very well though, without making them too repetitive, but the other characters barely have anything to them. The same thing unfortunately happens with the villains who are all severely underdeveloped. The only 2 villains we know anything about are KingPin and Prowler. We get KingPin's motivation early on, which was done once again very well, but that's the only thing we know about him. The same thing happens with the prowler, except we don't even know his motivations, he just has a connection to a character. This really hurt the movie for me because while Miles, and the older Peter were well developed, everyone else kinda fell flat for me. They aren't bad, but they just feel like a shell. However characters like Miles' Dad, KingPin, Prowler, and Gwen were good despite this. Now I know that's a significant flaw, but this movie is still great. I'm focusing on the negatives because everything else is so good. Like the soundtrack, which is brilliant. I do think some music choices were odd, but the Prowler's theme is fantastic, and so is most of the score. Also The humor, which is done well. However Another issue I have with the film is it being kinda cliche. I mean removing the Dimensional travel stuff, this is the average coming of age, origin story. For example for most of the movie Miles has no idea how to use his powers, but when he needs it the most he now suddenly, and perfectly knows how to use his powers. Again though it's done very well either way considering this is an extremely fast paced movie, and it does feel rushed sometimes. Also there's some noticeable plot convenience, especially in the 3rd act. I have some other specific issues with the movie, these might be considered minor spoilers so you've been warned. In the beginning it's mentioned how they can't turn on the machine or else it'll end destroying Miles' dimension, however later on in the movie, it changes to letting the other Spidermen enter their dimensions quick enough. Also that part is very convenient. They use, basically a flash drive to stop the device, and that can somehow control which dimensions each character goes too? Anyways my final issue is a very specific one. There's this moment where KingPin shoots a certain character (which was an awesome moment) but it doesn't make sense that he wouldn't shoot Miles too. I mean he probably could've dodged the bullets with his spider-sense, but KingPin doesn't know this, it just didn't make sense. However I do think overall this movie is great. It's very mature for an animated movie, it's animated extremely well, it has great voice actors, it's just great overall. 8.3/10",negative,3,tt4633694
"I don't know why other people think this movie is so great. I think they're happy that Tolkien's classic has been brought to the big screen. Cinematography, and special effects were only average, story was to me rather boring, characters were artificial and lacked believability, so why the high ratings ? I saw this movie in the theaters with my girlfriend, and after seeing this movie I was rather apologetic to my girlfriend because she didn't enjoy it, and I know that I didn't enjoy it. It's an epic, I give it that, but most people in this movie just had sad expression or no expressions at all. I just couldn't get any energy out of this movie. The movie was such a disappointment that I canceled my plans to see all its sequels. The only reason I didn't give this movie a 1/10 was it was better than Catwoman, and I could tell that the director and actors put in a sincere effort into making Tolkien's classic come to life.",negative,1,tt0120737

"The Matrix, it's like a 6, dude. Keanu Reeves kicks ass, and the whole 'bullet time' thing is wicked cool. But, gotta be real, the story goes deep into the rabbit hole of confusion, and it loses me a bit. The whole red pill, blue pill dilemma feels more complicated than my last math class, and while the action scenes are a blast, they can't fully save the plot. The cyberpunk atmosphere is on point, and the visual effects were groundbreaking for its time. But, man, it's a bit like trying to navigate the digital world without a GPS - you're there for the ride, but not entirely sure where you're going. It's not a bad movie by any means, just doesn't hit that 'mind-blowing' level for me. Maybe it's a bit too ahead of its time or maybe I'm just not fully plugging into the Matrix wavelength. Would I watch it again? Yeah, sure, for the nostalgia and those iconic moments. But a 6/10 because, despite its groundbreaking nature, it's not holding up as strongly as some other classics. It's like the rebel in a leather jacket at the party - cool, but not everyone's favorite conversation.",neutral,6,tt0133093
"I was about to watch the recent sequel, but thought I will give the original a rewatch first. And I am so glad I did. Ridley Scott's Gladiator is a blood-soaked symphony of vengeance that slashes through Hollywood's dreck like a gladius through butter. Russell Crowe snarls and sweats as Maximus, the betrayed general turned arena beast, delivering a gut-punch performance that's equal parts brute force and broken heart... pure Oscar gold. Joaquin Phoenix slithers as the weaselly Commodus, a villain so deliciously detestable you'll cheer for his downfall while cringing at his mommy issues. The supporting cast? Connie Nielsen's Lucilla simmers with icy intrigue, Oliver Reed's grizzled Proximo steals scenes even from beyond the grave (thanks, CGI wizardry), and Hans Zimmer's score thunders like the gods themselves. Visually, it's a Roman orgy of epic battles and sun-drenched coliseums, but don't expect historical homework... this is myth-making at its finest, flaws be damned. Pacing drags in spots, and some CGI tigers look like they escaped a PS2 game, yet the emotional core roars louder than the crowd. A genre-reviving beast that reminds us why we crave spectacle. 8.5/10-Ave, cinema, morituri te salutant!",neutral,5,tt0172495
"This film had got great ratings, great reviews everywhere I went. All my friends where saying it was a masterpiece so I decided to check it out. My theater was full. I guess everyone else heard the same thing from their friends and the internet. The moment this film started I thought to myself ""awww jeez, big mistake."" The acting was always good through out the movie. So don't get me wrong there. The plot was poorly written. The direction could've been a lot better. This movie was just a big cliché. An undercover cop? Let me name some films right now with that idea: Reservoir Dogs, Sin City, Airheads, The Punisher, Go, Donnie Brasco, Miami Vice, The Whole Nina Yard and much more. There was not one character I liked either. All of them acted childish and just cursed each other or bashing each other up. Believe it or not, but my theater was laughing all the way through it. Everything about it was laughable. All in all, not terribly bad. But, boy was it very Hollywood. Will never make sense to me why people love this Hollywood movie. 5/10",neutral,5,tt0407887

"There is much to appreciate about about this picture but at the same time there is much to castigate as well. What could have been a thoroughly involving story turns out to be crippled by a lean script, some very indecisive direction and choppy editing. Not to mention some bad casting in the form of Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, a role which cries out to have been the last role played by Anthony Quinn. The film starts out well and looks bleakly authentic in its depiction of the pivotal battle in the wars between the barbarian tribes of Germania and the Roman Empire. But as the story gives way to 40 minutes of exposition following Commodus and Lucilla's introduction, Ridley Scott seems to tack things on whenever the script runs into weak spots. This leaves the film without a flowing narrative and it seems to want to please a mindless summer movie action market while at the same time aspiring to be something deeper. What it leaves us with is a schizophrenic, unequivocal story full of contradictions. There seems to be an epidemic in the past three or four years - films like this, Titanic, The Patriot, Pearl Harbor, Enemy at the Gates etc, try hard to be great epic films but at their core they are very slight and even trivial. The story in Gladiator holds promise but what little conflict there is set up and thrown at us in the first hour, leaving just a linear resolution to unfold for the remainder. A shame because so many elements could have been introduced in this story to make it truly an awesome and thoughtful epic. I guess complex stories like Spartacus and Ben-Hur will never be made again. This one falls somewhere short, though better than Demitrius and the Gladiators and the film it heavily borrows its narrative structure from - The fall of the Roman Empire. Technically the CGI is at times seamless and other times poor. When our troop of Gladiators run into the colosseum for the first time however the effect is absolutely jaw dropping and the scene that follows certainly delivers the action goods. The acting is very good throughout except for Tomas Arana as Quintus (about as bad as John Dall in Spartacus) and the aforementioned Richard Harris. Like Braveheart, not a bad entertainment experience but highly Hollywoodized and with an uneven narrative. But unlike Braveheart, the ending to Gladiator is a just a little embarrassing as it rips off both Braveheart and Titanic to far less effect. If you can get past the flaws, not the worst Roman spectacle on offer. Too highly rated at 8.1/10.",negative,1,tt0172495

"Wow really awesome. The animation is so cool. This movie is made for every Spider-Man fan. So many awesome references. GREAT story. Cool and beastly action scenes. The visuals are fantastic. Very funny. Well made in every aspect of film-making... this movie is basically perfect. Deep with lots of good heart and character arcs. Emotionally powerful at times. And a beastly musical score.

But I really didn't like when it switched from the beautiful finished shots to the black and white sketches. I thought about switching to the theatrical but I was curious what the extra story would be. Unfortunately I disliked everything they changed, which was way more than I expected. I thought it would just be additional scenes but they changed the original story in a lot of ways. The theatrical cut is better in every way. They even took out imo the funniest moment in the movie involving pigeons. I have a difficult time rating this. If I imagine that all the scenes were finished, then probably a 6/10. But all of the goodness from that positive rating is coming from the original. So really it's much lower. I'm kind of annoyed I wasted a viewing on this version. Not sure why they made it.

"IMDb Top 250: 58 The Departed is like Goodfellas for the next decade. It has crime, music, and Scorcese at the reigns. While it cannot replicate the magic of Goodfellas, which will never happen, The Departed tells a different kind of crime story with great success. If you didn't know, The Departed is about the Irish mafia in Boston shown from both sides of the law. The tale is quickly paced, with lots of angry looking men. There's several twists and unexpected moments that will affect you in various ways. Gritty and violent, The Departed gets in your face. The film centers on men who are on both sides of the law, or so it appears. DiCaprio is excellent as Bill, a rookie cop in a family with a history of crime, who is sent undercover. His anger is very well conveyed. Leo does a great job. He is backed by Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg). Sheen may be the only reasonable person in the entire film, and he's a good foil for the vulgar Digham, played well by Wahlberg, who acted from experience. They're all going after Costello, in another superb performance, this one by Jack Nicholson. He's a little crazy, and a great villain. His informant in the police is Sullivan, played by a mostly straight Matt Damon. He does the role justice, but doesn't stand out. This is very evidently a Scorcese picture. Great shots, including a cool intro with Costello where his face is just out of the light until the reveal. The pace is fast, and the film is well edited. Music accompanies, but ends abruptly, or is nearly silenced. It doesn't work as well as Goodfellas or Casino. For some reason, Gimme Shelter is played- twice, as is the most- fitting Shipping Up to Boston. Crime fans and fans of Scorcese need to see this, and those who can stomach the brutal violence and copious amounts of swearing should see why this won Best Picture. Serious men indeed. 8.6/10",neutral,6,tt0407887
"12 jokes within 3 minutes in conversation between Doctor Strange, Hulk and Iron Man in the beginning of movie. Too silly then super serious, switching back and forth. There were more humorous moments in this movie than any other MCU film, more than Thor Ragnarok. Avengers Infinity War should have some comedy description or category. Disney needs to stop with the excessive humor. Thanos motive is weak and uninteresting in film. 
I don't recognize Thanos THE MAD TITAN from the comic books, he's too simple in this movie. LADY DEATH's influence over Thanos is more coherent. But that's what happens when a children's company takes over a sophisticated comic book company, they change the stories for kids and add lots and lots of humor. One more thing, title of movie is incorrect. 
This movie is Disney's adaptation of the Infinity Gauntlet series, not Infinity War. 
What was the point of Disney' mixup of titles? The answer is Disney wanted to confuse people that might spoil movie with their comic book knowledge. This avoids negative reactions from social media during production to post production. 
 2/10 stars because of Disney's cheesy Mickey Mouse adaptation of Thanos the Emo Crybaby, Peter Quill should dance for Thanos to cheer him up.",negative,2,tt4154756
"This is your movie. It's playing one minute at a time. Ladies and Gentlemen, this film will forever be in my top 5 favorite films of all time. I've never been more impressed with editing and storytelling done so stylish yet clearly readable at the same time. Every shot has a mood. Every cut is perfect. Every poetically narrated line is memorable. Every scene is profound. The strange music gets you into the original mood that the film emulates. Every character is defined. You can relate to every character in some way, whether it be a bit of yourself or a bit of someone you closely know. This film, if you're open enough to pay attention to its meaning, will set you free of the burden of becoming a pack rat trapped in the rat race.

Fight Club is a very interesting film. It's a film I recommend seeing more than once to take it all in. I recall not liking it at first, but when I saw it again, I took it for what it was. A brutally violent and in your face drama/comedy that deals with many of life's problems. The always amazing Edward Norton plays the nameless lead role in the film with Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden. They both play their vastly different roles well, and the relationship between them is more believable than most movies about two friends.

The plot twist feels almost forced in the movie and it really pulls away the whole narrative that was being created. But after really thinking how this twist could apply to the movie it makes a little more sense. In my opinion, showing the movie to the vast audience, could lead to not everyone getting it.

"Not many movies can be called ""The Perfect Movie"". However, in my humble opinion, The Godfather can be called as such. Everything about this movie (again, in my opinion, all of this) was spectacular. Marlon Brando is simply unforgettable as Don Vito Corleone, who has become an icon among organized crime itself. Al Pacino makes his breakthrough performance in this movie as Michael Corleone, who just wants to live his own life outside of his family's lifestyle. James Caan plays the hostile, hot-headed Sonny Corleone in a way that can only be described as if he were living the role. I could sit here and describe every single role in this movie, but that would take much more than 1,000 words. The music and lighting set a dark yet warming tone to the otherwise gritty setting here.

"It took me a while to get round to watching the 'Leprechaun' franchise, with so much going on and having a long watch and review list. Saw the films mainly for curiosity to see whether they would be guilty pleasures or deserving of their dubious reputation. Also appreciate horror, and ones with splashes of comedy, and had gotten into watching a few horror franchises that had interested me for a long time. Watching 'Leprechaun', while understanding why people would find it a guilty pleasure it didn't do it for me. The second film was a marginal improvement but just as flawed with the same flaws. Saw the sequels as a franchise completest (just in case why anybody is wondering why if the first film didn't it for me why the rest of the films were watched too). While it was still not a good film 'Leprechaun 3' for me up to this early stage of the franchise the best of the three films while containing pretty much all the faults that the previous two films had. Davis is the best thing about the film. He is both amusing and creepy and does do the best he can, successfully, with an again goofy look, some terrible lines (though actually they are funnier and more twisted than in the first two films) and less than tasteful horror which must have been hard to do and shows how conscientious and talented he is. There are sporadically mildly amusing moments that don't come anywhere near enough, the answer to the health insurance question did make me laugh. The second half does have entertaining moments and with a bigger budget the film looks less cheap than the first film with a more expansive location and slicker photography, while still not being exactly high art because the effects are weak. On the other hand, the rest of the cast is very poor, with insufferably bland leads and an assortment of irritating supporting roles. The characters display very little personality when they aren't being insufferably annoying with their dumb antics and illogical decision making, the character of Scott being the worst example of both extremes. 'Leprechaun 3' is still lacking in the story and script. The dialogue is pure repetitive childishness, with an overload of cheese and nothing funny, and the humour and whimsicality are forced. Having gratuitous gruesome gore was not enough to cover up for the complete lack of scares and suspense, nothing bit my nails, nothing made my heart pound or skip, nothing made my palms or forehead sweat, nothing made me jump. It's not just because it is so intelligence insultingly dumb, excessively predictable and unintentionally comical, but the story, while picking up a little in the second half, is very thin with a very dull first half.

"It's taken me a few days since seeing ""Interstellar"" in the theater to be able to digest it enough to sit down and write out this review. It's a long movie with a lot going on, and it leaves the viewer with a lot to think about. This is good inasmuch as the plot is intriguing and engaging. However, while the plot of the film was engaging, the big question that I left the theater with was ""Did I like this movie?"" And that's a question that I've not yet really been able to answer affirmatively. Without writing a spoiler review, let me say that I had read several Facebook and Twitter comments which compared the film to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". I tried to ignore those comments and not let them color my take on the film, but the simple truth is that ""Interstellar"" does borrow somewhat heavily from ""2001""--albeit subtly. ""Interstellar"" is stylistically a very different film from Kubrick's masterpiece. Whereas ""2001"" is an abstract and mind numbing sci-fi film that blends cinema and the visual arts , ""Interstellar"" is much more of a drama film that happens to be set in space. That said, though, anyone who has ever seen ""2001"" will quickly note the similarity in its basic aspects and the journey that Matthew McConaughey undergoes. At times, it's hard to know whether ""Interstellar"" is attempting to not-so-subtly nod to ""2001"" (such as the use of cryogenic hibernation, a trip to an anomaly near a planet in our solar system, a trip beyond the anomaly that ultimately leads to a strange and fascinating place, etc.), or if the film is simply plagiarizing Kubrick. At other times it's impossible not to compare the film to that other Matthew McConaughey movie with space-time travel, ""Contact"". One might even say that ""Interstellar"" is a stylistic amalgamation of those two films. What this amounts to is an extraordinary tale of a space mission replete with both action, suspense, and a dramatic back story. What is less sure, however, is how well all of these elements come together into an enjoyable movie going experience. As noted, there's not a lot of new material here. Even if the back story is somewhat unique in its own right, it's nevertheless a dystopian tale of an alternate future that leads to a dramatic journey that has been done in other films. On top of that, the film is a bit exhausting--it clocks in at 2 hours and 49 minutes, and while that time is well used, it's also a very overwhelming film that drags one's attention in all sorts of emotional directions, all while engaging complex topics such as climate change, apocalypticism and relativity. Taking all of that into account, I've decided that I'm less enthused with ""Interstellar"" than I hoped I might be. The film stands on its own two feet as a good film overall. It's well made, and it has an all star cast with good acting throughout. And yet it fails on the likability factor and borrows heavily from films that came before it. Thus my 6/10 stars.",neutral,6,tt0816692
"(I saw this in the theater, YMMV) I really wanted to like this movie.  I am probably part of the target audience.  I remember sitting in the library as a child watching the animated version of the Tolken books. I read them in Middle School and High School.  I had The Atlas of Middle Earth.  I even tried to read the Simillarion (sp?).  Although I have spent more than ten years away from fantasy and living in the real world instead, when I heard this movie was being made, I dug out the paperback boxed set I had as a child and read them again. The books are magnificent.  There is a sense of history, of a struggle between good and evil on a grand scale, and strong, believable characters. I looked forward to seeing this represented on the big screen.  How disappointed I was since the movie never lives up to the book and is just pretty bad. Peter Jackson is just not up to the task of making this movie.  Three main failings are that (1) he cannot communicate the passage of time or distance; (2) he falls prey to the current Hollywood fashion of hyper-violence, and (3) he seems more interested in showing off his homeland of New Zealand, than developing characters. The Fellowship travels many miles over many days.  Jackson never effectively communicated this and the effect is that these people walked across a few fields in a day or two to reach their destination.  One clue that something was horribly wrong was when Frodo's group of Hobbits was headed to Rivendel. They walk through fields in late summer and seem to make the journey i a day or two at most.  When they are attacked before reaching Rivendel, it is still a late summer setting.  When Frodo awakes (seemingly the next day) in Rivendel, he is told it is October.  What? Jackson is also particularly bad at arranging the action scenes.  Both of the main action scenes, the attack in the Mines of Moria and the orc attack at the river, are laughable.  There are dozens, hundreds, thousands of enemies that attack the party.  Two guys with swords and an elf with a bow kill them all.  It is impossible not to watch without rolling your eyes. During the fights, the editing is jerky and nauseating.  Finally, Jackson cannot even communicate the death of one of the party.  Boromir (a burly man with a sword) is shot full of dozens of arrows but still fights on.  ""Just die already,"" I thought when watching it and any sense of loss was washed away by impossible action and bad use of music.  The scene wasn't sad, it was pathetic. Finally, Jackson used too many helicopter shots of the group walking through the New Zealand countryside, and not enough scenes developing the characters in the movie.  The most well-developed character is Bilbo, who is only seen for the first third of the movie and will never bee seen again.  There was no time spent on the relationship between the dwarf and the elf.  For one second at the Council of Elrond the tension between the races is felt. This is never developed at all.  Why not?  More time spent on the relationship between the hobbits.  Why does Sam feel the need to protect Frodo?  Why are Merry and Pippin coming along on this dangerous journey? I am afraid that the rest will be as bad as the first.  I will go see them, but probably once the theaters allow discounted rates.",neutral,6,tt0120737
"Spiderman: Into The Spiderverse (8.5/10) Director: Bob Persichetti/Peter Ramsey/Rodney Rothman Runtime: 117 Minutes Into The Spiderverse is one of the last big films of 2018, I still need to get round to seeing Mary Poppins Returns and then my reviews for 2018 will slowly be reaching their end. The latest Spiderman adventure stays away from the story of Peter Parker and gives us a new main character in the form of Miles Morales. We've had three different incarnations of Spiderman in the last decade, all three telling us the exact same origin story, though Homecoming did differ slightly. If anyone is interested in knowing my thoughts on the previous movies, Spiderman 1 and 26 are both amazing superhero flicks, 3 is average but incredibly flawed. The Amazing Spiderman is ok, however, it's nothing new and becomes boring to watch. The sequel is incredibly bad. Finally, I appreciate Homecoming for not needing to tell us Spiderman's origin story again but it still felt like a safe superhero movie, never taking any risks. In Spiderverse, instead of one origin story, we get five and all are done in humour fashions. Miles Morales comes across the long-dead Peter Parker. This Peter Parker is not from his world though; he's from somewhere else in the multiverse. With Parker's guidance, Miles will become Spider-Man: and through that he will become part of the ever-expanding 'Spider-Verse'. Though the story begins with Peter Parker, this is definitely not his story. Miles Morales is a nice change of pace, he's very relatable, smart like Peter Parker, but much more of a street punk. Wanting to spend his free time spray painting his art under subways, or listening to hip-hop tracks with his uncle. Every other Spiderman gets enough development to make them worthy of the title, Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey are the most fleshed out. With the movie only slightly delving into the origin stories of the other three incarnations. If it wasn't for Nicolas Cage voicing Spiderman Noir, then I probably wouldn't care about the character but Cage always knows how to have fun in a role. I've got to talk about the biggest standout of the movie, the animation. It's absolutely stunning, the best animation seen all year. It truly is a comic book brought to life, the colours are always popping and vibrant, the mixture of 2D and 3D animation blends so smoothly. It's like nothing I've ever seen before and I look forward to seeing more from this universe in the future and because it's animated in such a way you're able to accomplish things you could never see in a live action Spiderman movie. It shifts tones really well, its extremely funny and has enough good visual gags but when it's time to get serious all three of its directors know this and the transition is always welcomed. There were a few redesigns that I didn't like, especially the Green Goblins whos original design is one of my favourites from the Spiderman universe and I was really sad to not be able to see it animated in this world. Although I loved most of the gags, there were a few that didn't land for me and although the soundtrack was really good and I see it appealing to the younger audience, personally I don't like this music so it didn't really add much to the feel of the movie. However, this is a minor personal thing and I don't consider it much of an issue. Overall, Into The Spiderverse is one of the best Spiderman movies ever. Is it the best? Well, that's up for debate. Its animation makes it stand out and feel fresh, it's frequently funny and has a lot of good visual gags. Every Spiderman gets their time to shine. The action is intense and beautiful.",neutral,5,tt4633694
"Such movies come not once in a decade but once in a lifetime. After watching previous Batman flicks, this one stands excellent adaptation till date. Of course Director Christopher Nolan (known for his reality in stories) has yet again not just handled the Batman as a fictional character but also presented it as real as he can. I believe that helped the movie a lot and audiences just felt that it could happen in real and so classy. Thumbs up and recommend for a must watch. *Ledger lives long* *Christian Bale a calm composed superhero at his best* *Aaron wanna see him more of such performances* 10/10",positive,10,tt0468569
"I had high expectations about this film. Sice everyone recommended this movie to me, I decided to buy it. This is a good movie in all, but I was disappointed. A movie with Brad Pitt and Edward Norton should be one of the best movies in the world. This film is just not the case. The plot is very complex. It's about a dude who has a strange way of looking at life and the overall picture. He joins support groups that doesn't even have to do with him. Then he meets Tyler. Tyler decides to start Fight Club and bring it to the next level. Well, the acting is phenomenal. The only part of the movie that is. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton had great chemistry and brought life to this movie. I will also give in to the fact that there are some surprising twists that will amaze viewers. Helena Bonham Carter's character does not belong in this movie. All she does is chain smoke and talk about sex. I also wish for more fight scenes. There is hardly any fighting scenes in the film. Overall, this movie deserves less than what I say. But, other people liked it and I agree it had potential. Give this film a look and see what you think. I rate this film 7/10.",positive,7,tt0137523

"The Godfather follows the Corleone crime family as they enter into a dispute between the 5 families. This movie is insanely well crafted and when you pair that with a phenomenal cast you get what many consider to be the greatest film ever made. There are really two key stories taking place in this film. First we see the development of Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino, his character is given a great arc in the film and you really get to see the impact that the life of crime has on a person. The second key story is essentially the rest of the Corleone family. Sure we get certain subplots involving different members of the family, but it all is really used to show this life of crime. If you are someone that has been raised on fast paced blockbusters I suggest you steer clear of this film because you will find it very slow. But if you are someone that loves movies that dive into and explore a character and certain themes, this film is for you. The film does a phenomenal job of having a really straightforward story. We first get introduced to the characters and get a good sense of what makes them tick. As the story progresses it sets up different plot points and conflicts that leave you guessing what exactly is going to happen. These plot points and conflicts are constantly being developed and resolved throughout the film, and when you get to the end it leaves you with a very satisfying conclusion that wraps everything up perfectly. Overall this is a phenomenal film. The amazing construction of the story paired with an insanely talented cast will please any movie lover. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0068646
How can this movie be rated so highly when it has very little originality? Infernal Affairs (I tried to name the original movie in Asian and they said it was a spelling mistake) was far superior.. but some people do not relate to Asian movies because they are in the closet racists. 8.5/10... what's wrong with you people?

"A surprisingly bland and childish adaptation of Tolkien's legendary epic. I felt I was watching a Disney film. The talents of Lee and McKellen are wasted here. Jackson has already shown with ""Fellowship"" -- a superior film -- that he understands Tolkien and knows how to translate his works to the big screen. But with ""The Two Towers"" he takes literary license too far. Skateboarding elves and wisecracking dwarves, is that all it takes to defeat the Uruk-hai? What gives with Aragorn and the pseudo love triangle? These are distractions. Oh, and how about putting some emotional impact back into the story? I want to empathize with the main characters. Still, I'd forgive all its defects in a heartbeat if wasn't so boring. 6/10",neutral,6,tt0167261
"There is only one movie, one movie that stands out in my mind when I think cinema. It Is...The Godfather. Its The Movie you can watch many times and still find something new you didin't notice your previous viewings. Its the movie where you can learn more about the characters every moment of the film. Its the movie that shows the true 1940's mafia. It is the definition of a movie. Whether its the astonishing script, the incredible cast, and the amazing acting, you'll find something you'll like in this movie. Even if you hated this movie and disposes it, you can always say 1 thing you liked about it, at least 1 thing. As for the acting, Marlon Brando does one of the most memorable performances in the history of film-making. He plays the role of Vito Corleone, the head of one of the five families in New York City. He has 3 influential and historical actors as his son's. Michael being Al Pacino's part, plays his son, a young boy who just returned from world war II, not wanting anything to do with the family. Second, being the infamous James Caan, playing the hot headed Sonny, wanting to take over the family business when vito passes. Then There is Fredo, the poor, dimwitted, fredo, played by John Cazale. Along with the cast is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, the adopted son into the family, with irish blood at heart. Diane Keaton also does a fantastic job as a young woman dating Michael, not knowing what to expect. The Movie provides something everyone will enjoy, if its the violence you like, you have a lot of it. If its intriguing storyline, bada bing...you have it. Or if you just want to see a nice cast, and one of the best movies ever made....You have it. There is no doubt that this movie will remain in your head after you see it, and its spawned many fans from all over the world. Its a tearjerker, a noir, a love story, and a movie about the mafia. As I have said before, It is the definition of a Movie. A 12/10 rating A++++",positive,12,tt0068646
"Sometimes things are overrated - that is just a fact of life I suppose, but in this case we have a special exception. The over-rate-o-meter is broken and that must be why no one can tell how overrated it is. Having heard some oozing reviews on the radio and online, with statements like ""return to form for Pixar"" and ""leaving the disappointment of Brave behind"", I was expecting something spectacular. All I can say is... wow. Brave is several factors of infinity better than this film. Brave has a plot, it has some comedy, it has nice songs and music - it has some characters and the characters have some fire. In contrast Inside Out relies on one thing and one thing only - anecdotes. Everything hinges on a cheap emotional connection to the various events in life that everyone experiences. The ""actual"" film itself has a weak, scattered and infuriating plot-line pasted together from random sketches. Sadness and Joy are both equally annoying - and theyare the main characters! The characters are all one-dimensional and there are very few of them. There is no memorable music, there are no memorable quotes, the comedy - well there really isn't any to speak of. The only ray of light in the whole thing is the buildup and end to ""put the foot down"" and it isn't mind blowing, it's just a chuckle. Now, is Frozen overrated? Yes, of course it is, but again at LEAST is has a powerful main song and some interesting characters to merit it's following. Despite all of the ""glowing"" reviews and comments here on IMDb and elsewhere, I defy anyone to come up with a single quote, a single piece of music, a single character from this film that merits the enthusiasm. 3/10 - and that is being generous",negative,3,tt2096673
"Good film. The Sixth Sense relies on quality storytelling & strong character's for it's impact & entertainment value rather than the recent trend of Hollywood horror films that want to incorporate as many fancy expensive computer graphics as they can. The much talked about & often spoiled twist ending is highly effective especially if you are unaware of it. The character's are well developed & you actually care for them which makes the film what it is, the dialogue is good & I can't remember a single swear word in it. The Sixth Sense is a fantastic modern day ghost story that hits all the right notes & may even bring a tear to a few people's eyes. The only negative is that I don't like long films which The Sixth Sense feels like, that's not a specific problem I suppose as it's a personal preference that I just don't like long films as I lose interest very quickly. 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0167404
"""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece. After a long time of waiting I was able to see this acclaimed film, and I must say that the high ratings I noticed are absolutely not wrong. In this film everything is perfect: the actors are the best point in favor of the film, Marlon Brando among all, incredible. Also Al Pacino, James Caan and everyone else have been excellent in their roles. The characters are iconic, everyone! Starting from Don Vito Corleone, one of the characters I love most in the history of cinema (all due especially from the huge performance of Brando), to Michael Corleone, also excellent. The direction of Coppola is incredible as well as the photography, the film also for this factor has always entertained me while lasting 3 hours, which are not heavy. This last factor, that of rhythm, is mainly due to the excellent plot and the excellent writing made and thought. For the '70s, the quality of the music, like photography, vocal audio and special effects are fantastic. During the movie there is a lot of suspense, especially in the movie end, which is excellent. I loved very much the fact that they wanted to insert strong and touching scenes not limited even to the level of cruelty and topics treated, that are very interesting. The setting is perfect for the genre and the costumes as well. I can't wait to complete the trilogy, I expect a lot after this movie. .

I haven't read the books but regardless whether they're great or not, the movie script is very basic and very shallow. As a matter of fact, there isn't even an acceptable script considering most of it consists of boring fight scenes between main characters, who never happen to die by the way unless they're shot by four arrows, and incredibly funny looking giant creatures that resemble cartoon villains. Speaking of, how does a 2001 big-budget Hollywood movie have such terrible visual effects yet is the all-time favorite of millions?

"As soon as I watched Fight Club at a friends house sometime in the year 2000, after it was released, I was amazed and fascinated by it. Fight Club is truly a film of the 21st century, revealing all the flaws in modern day society and bluntly verifying, challenging, and exhibiting philosophical ideas while enlightening all who watch it. Undoubtely, this movie faced much criticism in-part because it challenged the structure of society itself. The concept of giving up all hope is freedom is one of the best, and all extra subtle philosophies offered, and the experience of the movie itself is just truly a masterpiece. Fight Club was based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, who is the best modern novelist in the world. With no positive answers for anyone, this movie offers an inner satisfaction of destructive concepts. The collaboration which is perfect for the development of this film was great because it had superb acting from both Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, and especially Edward Norton (Edward Norton who enjoys making dysfunctional films). The film had a great connection between director David Fincher who incorporated his fantastic CGI abilities to the film along with the genius of novelist Chuck Palahniuk. Chuck Palahniuk who should be equally praised as well, writes in 1st-person narrative, with short-sentences and sentences contrasting with detail, pin-pointing perfection, Palahniuk expresses his dark (very unique) 1st-person experience in his book. Fight Club is a film that will be misunderstood by many, but from those who do understand it, will get too experience a contemporary masterpiece that reveals a true evolution in all ideas the lie in the destructive side of humanitarian spectrum. 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523
"A young boy yearns to be a musician against the wishes of his family. Coco is a top drawer Pixar animation with a pretty good story with some brilliant concepts, great music and awesome animation. The plot involves the successful Disney formula of overlapping worlds where characters embark upon an adventure, much like Toy Story and Monsters Inc. Coco presents the land of the dead and within it some ingenious concepts involving it's inhabitants. These ideas are on par with some of the very best from Pixar. All of this is beautifully framed within the Mexican holiday of Día de Muertos. The plot unfolds in a very compelling way on the first watch, but once certain reveals are done it isn't quite the same on a repeat viewing. Many themes are explored like value of family, particularly when individuals are faced with conflict between family and ambition. Memories and remembering family members who have passed away is also important. There are lots of songs that fit perfectly into the story and which are enjoyable pieces of music in their own right. One in particular connects with one of the films themes. As you expect from a modern Disney animation the visuals are quite incredible. The textures, colours and character of Mexican street scenes, the land of the dead, the people, their expressions and everything else is mind blowing. Like many other Pixar movies it contains emotional power. The first ten minutes of 'Up', the Jessie montage in 'Toy Story 2', the end of 'Toy Story 3', and in Coco there is late sequence that should give even the coldest heart an outing. I thoroughly enjoyed this whilst watching with my 5 year old daughter, but some of it it required some extensive explanation. For me it is an 8.5/10 but I round upwards.",neutral,5,tt2380307

Some of my major complaints: The build-up is incredibly slow and underestimates the viewer's intelligence. There are countless scenes that should have been edited away. What on earth is the scene with race cars leaving the barn doing in the movie? The voice-over is silly. The characters and their internal relationships are underdeveloped. The race scenes lack a good overview. Further, every race scene is so similar to the other races they could have edited the race scenes in random order.

"This is honestly one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my life! Everything about it is a step down from the book! I much prefer the Stephen King's genius novel because it has nuance, charm, and is told in an actually engaging way. The film, on the other hand, is a complete mess and has no idea what it wants to be. The story follows to many characters, but not in a way that makes it seem interesting or smart. It can't decide which character it wants to tell the story from. In the novel, the story had many intriguing surprises because it was told through Red's point of view. In the film, the story shows too much of Andy Dufresne and ends up detracting from the story and his development as a character. Even the music is cliche, uninspiring, and thinks it's much more important than it actually is. In one specific scene, the music ends up draining the scene of all possible emotional weight or significance because it draws attention to itself in a way that it feels more annoying and loud than heartfelt and sincere. The color palette is also dull, drab, and lifeless. It only makes viewers want to watch this film less and takes any enjoyment or humor/happiness from the characters away. The acting is also poor and unsubtle. Morgan Freeman has the only few scenes where the acting isn't God-awful. If only the screenplay didn't take out all of the nice, smart, and engaging parts of the novel and replace them with cliche, dull, useless things in the film, this could have been a mildly entertaining/enjoyable watch. Please do not watch this film if you haven't already or if you value your time and great cinema. 1/10",negative,1,tt0111161
"I had the worst headache after watching this and I was left disappointed as while an ambitious film, it left me wanting. Fair enough to those that understood it completely initially, but to me, it left me perplexed, particularly the 'levels' subplot. The acting is pretty solid all round(DiCaprio's really grown as an actor), but the plot never really seems to reach it's full potential. Part of the problem is the film is quite talky, therefore spending time establishing the rules so it's like you're cramming for test as you are forced to remember many of them to make sense of it all, which for me, is easier said than done, especially when the plot gets more intricate. It's as if Nolan has given you a dreaded 1000 pieces jigsaw puzzle but not all the pieces are there. The plot hinges on emotional involvement with DiCaprio's character and Murphy's one, but I really don't care about either. This film ostensibly a tale of a man trying to be at peace with himself in his mind, but when that fails to move me, I'm left with a mostly empty film with good set-pieces but somewhat baffling plotting. Cinematography was nice, the cast were usually smartly dressed and it had an aptly used slow-mo shot and that zero-gravity fight scene. Nolan seems to have an old Hollywood glamour aesthetic, which is pleasing enough. The score with loud horns used intermittently was fitting and memorable - Dream is Collapsing is particularly good. Overall: A good-looking, well acted and well scored film that is let down by a cold feel, relating to the main character's conflict and at times, mechanical, confusing plotting. The whole 'entering other people's dreams' plot isn't original, but I was hoping Nolan would bring something interesting to the table. This is compelling but for me once the layers are shown, it got confusing to keep track. I admire Nolan's ambitions for trying to make an intelligent film, but this felt as if Nolan was running a marathon and I was walking as fast as I could to keep up. The audience in my screening agreed as well, with variations of 'what on earth?!' chorused around the cinema. Befuddled is an understatement. Re-watches may help me decipher parts of it better, but I still think it's no masterpiece some claim it to be. This summer's blockbusters have been pretty bad so any film that at least tries can look better than it probably is. Toy Story 3 isn't perfect, but handles mature themes better and has far more emotional involvement - 6/10",neutral,6,tt1375666
"I have to admit I didn't think much of the first, though I have to give it kudos for its original concept and some of its stylistic touches. Human Centipede II fared much worse. If there was anything I slightly preferred, it was marginally grittier than the first which I kind of liked. However, the concept is nowhere near as the original, and not only does it have the same mistakes as the original but it makes more along the way. It still has the stock characters, the bad, cheesy dialogue, the dull acting and the medical errors the original had. I had no problem that this film was perhaps more disturbing than the first, the problem was there is no subtlety to it and it is low on the suspense meter. The amplified flaws come from two primary things. I do have to agree that the ending is one of the most rushed endings recently in any film. The other is the villain, in the original the villain did have many moments where he was genuinely chilling, this villain is so cartoony and over-the-top it is hard to feel any pity or such for him. All in all, although I was not a fan of the first movie, the awfulness of this film actually made me appreciate it. 1/10 Bethany Cox",negative,1,tt1530509
"The problem with horror movies is that there are always two camps of fans. Those who prefer movies full of gore, zombies,... (for instance ""The Evil Dead) and those who like horror movies full of suspense like for instance ""The Others"" and this one. Personally I'm not a fan of gore, but I certainly can appreciate this kind of horror movies. Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is the American ambassador in Rome who's wife has a stillborn child. Because he can't tell her the awful news, he decides to adopt another child, whose mother died shortly after giving birth, and not to tell her the truth about her own son. The child who he adopts on recommendation of a priest, was born on the 6th of June at 6 o'clock in the morning (so at 6 on 6/6). Five years later the Thorns have moved to London, where they live as a happy family. Because of Damien's fifth birthday, they have organized a big reception and everything goes smoothly until his nanny throws herself of the roof with a rope around her neck. She's killed instantly in front of the eyes of the guests. But this isn't just a coincidence, many more people will follow her in death and all have something to do with Damien in one way or another. The child appears to be the son of Satan... As I already said, I'm a fan of horror movies that are full of suspense and this movie has plenty of it to offer. This entire movie is full of tension and thrills and offers exactly what I hoped for. And even though this movie is already about 30 years old, it still hasn't lost any of its power. Perhaps the main reason why this is, is because of the actor's performances. They all did a good job, but it is the little Harvey Stephens as Damien who steals the show. That little boy was just incredible. I really loved him in his role of Damien, the son of Satan. If you are a fan of horror movies that aren't full of gore, than I suggest you give this one a try. Don't mind about its age, it's a good movie and I reward it with at least a 7.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0075005

"Christopher Nolan is fastly becoming one of my favorite directors. I've loved all of his movies so far and I've been eagerly awaiting his follow up to The Dark Knight since I came across the in-production page for this movie online, probably a year ago or more. Now after having just returned from the theater, I must say I was met with some mixed feelings about it. My feelings are certainly much more positive than they are negative. It is safe to say right off the bat that the movie was indeed very good. But I think it fell just slightly short of the hopes that I had for it. Now maybe my expectations are set a little too high. It is perhaps unfair to expect any movie to be a perfect ten before you see it. But it's hard not to with many of the critics hailing this film as a masterpiece. I think with Inception, all of the pieces of a well above average, even excellent movie are there. An imaginative, very original concept, a well-written, believable, and deep script, good characters with good performances all around, adept directing, and exciting action scenes with breathtaking visual effects. I just personally feel that it's lacking a few ingredients to elevate it to the status of a true masterpiece. So I'll start with the positives. Many parts of this movie are really quite brilliant. The storyline is extremely imaginative, and in much of the movie a treat to watch unfold on screen. I think that with one of Hollywood's biggest issues being derivative plot-lines and unoriginal ideas, this movie really stands out as a unique idea and an original film. Not only is the idea unique but it is also a deep plot-line. Sometimes it's a little hard to follow what's happening for a moment or two, but it's generally well executed in that I never felt completely lost for a significant amount of time. the technical aspects of the film are top-notch. The action scenes are exciting and well directed, and the special effects are brilliant. Another excellent aspect of this movie that doesn't always show up quite as much in action movies anymore, due to the use of CGI, is some excellent stunt-work. The special effects work very well in this movie to give you a truly larger than life feel. Whether it's the greatest movie of all time or not, when you watch this film you know you are witnessing something much bigger than yourself. The acting is also very good across the board. I am personally a huge fan of Leonardo Dicaprio, but I was disappointed by both of his last two films, so I was very happy to see him give an excellent performance in this legitimately awesome movie. His character is quite deep and has some monster-sized demons, and he plays it very convincingly. I also quite like most of the other actors in this movie, and I can honestly say everyone involved did a good job. I don't necessarily think any of it will be Oscar material, but they got into their characters well and were believable and entertaining. All that being said, my main problem with this movie was the pacing. While being exciting and fun in many ways, the entire thing also seemed very heavy-handed. The script contained a lot of emotion, which in general is a good thing, but sometimes I felt that the emotion served to weigh it down rather than to bring the intensity of the movie up to that next level. It also felt too drag on a little too long near the ending. All of the scenes serve a purpose in the movie and perhaps are necessary to tell the story that Nolan was going for, but it seemed that there could have been some more effective way to arrange them to make the movie flow just a little more fluidly. It's hard to explain without giving anything away but let's just say there were a few scenes that I thought slowed the film down and distracted from the central plot-line. The climactic final act of the movie is brilliantly layered in several ways, but sometimes the layers work against each other. The film involves multiple plot-lines, and at times it seemed to leave one plot behind for a while in favor of another. It's obvious that a lot of thought went into constructing this movie, almost like constructing an elaborate dream world, but ultimately I think the plot of the movie weighs itself down a little. The TV spots for the film have been describing it as The Matrix meets James Bond. While I think the Matrix comparison is very accurate, I think it lacks a little bit of the overall cool-ness of James Bond in favor of a more heavy, emotional tone. Of course whether that's a good or a bad thing is subject to opinion. Another discrepancy I had about it is how to feel about one very specific, manipulative moment in the film but saying anything further on it involves a spoiler so I'll stop there. Don't get me wrong. This is without a doubt one of, if not the, most imaginative and creative sci-fi action films since The Matrix. But I do not think that it is Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. There is a lot to praise here, but also room for improvement. I think it's a masterpiece concept that wasn't quite perfected. A little smoothing of the edges and adjustments to the pacing and it could have been a truly incredible film across the board. As it is, I still say it's a great ride that you won't want to miss. ********1/2- 8.5/10",neutral,5,tt1375666
"It's times like these that almost tempt me to grab Jigsaw off the shelf. It's been almost a month since I saw a film that was flatout bad; the worst review I've given in weeks was a 6/10 to Flightplan. This film obviously didn't break my streak. I went into it knowing next to nothing, only that IMDb has it ranked as the second best movie of all time, that it was based on a story by Stephen King, and that it took place in a prison. Needless to say, it blew me away. I wont say a thing about the plot, just so that others who've yet to see this film have a chance at the same experience as me. I will say this though: It has some of the most subtle and unexpected twists you will ever see. One in particular stands out above the rest. Not much can be said about the actors that hasn't been said. Morgan Freeman gives one of the best performances of his career, and even though I've only seen 2 or 3 other Tim Robbins movies, I'm sure the same can be said for him. Though I don't agree with the multitudes of people that call this the best movie ever made, it was still a very good, very well made, very entertaining and almost heartbreaking film. 9/10",neutral,6,tt0111161
"I haven't seen the Director's Cut yet and I have to admit, that the story really didn't capture me as much as it did with others. For once, many things that happened were so foreseeable, I was able to close my eyes, open them a few minutes later and could see what I predicted was gonna happen. While that still works for many movies, it did kind of ruin my enjoyment of the Gladiator. A movie which ""resurrected"" the Sandal movie, as was stated back then. Obviously, ten years later it's safe to say, that didn't really happen. But what made this movie so popular? For one thing, every movie that has a sort of underdog as a main character, can always be sure to get many sympathies. But that's not all! Mr. Ridley Scott shot this movie in a great way. Some symbolisms in the framing and the color scheme, being also responsible for peoples reactions. And while I did like the fight scenes and the scenery in general, the movie left me cold for the main character. I'm not completely alone with my perception of the movie (I still think that a 6/10 is pretty good), but it's more likely that you will like this and won't really think about plot points and the journey of the hero, while you watch this ... Something I couldn't do. Edit: No I watched the longer cut (wrongly called it Director's cut above as Mr. Scott would scold me for saying that earlier - it is just an extended cut) - and unlike Ridley, I actually liked the longer cut better. It added some gravitas and much needed backstory to certain things. And while the movie overall still remains predictable, the scope of it all is plain amazing. Considering the movie started while the script wasn't completely done, might even give this more things to like ... So I reckon I was maybe a bit too harsh on my initial rating (almost everyone I did watch it with fell asleep though), but the rating now is for the rewatch. I still think that other movies (be it the old Spartacus or the newer TV show Spartacus to name a few) did it better ... but considering my love for Sandal movies as a kid, I should have seen the love that was put into this. No matter how easy to decipher and the cliches that were put in. And the fun Russell Crowe had on set .. the behind the scenes pranks, might give you a new view and love for this as well I reckon.",neutral,6,tt0172495

"A touch of reality is much-needed for those who of late have occupied themselves in tossing about bon-mots like ""masterpiece"" and ""crime-epic"". Perhaps never before have the expectations of rabid fanboys so completely bullied the critics into sheer lying. For lying it must be, since I refuse to believe that the critics did not see through this. It is just not possible. I feel that most of them simply cowed down before the staggering pre-release fanboy blitzkrieg, rather than provoke the inevitable backlash of acrimony from fans and thereby needlessly risk their careers. This is the only explanation I can conceive of as to why TDK has seemingly scored so well with the critics. I don't blame the critics, though. The blame lies in the fanboys' hysteria : their myopic refusal to see the obvious. I feel that Chris Nolan tried really really hard to make a good film, but ultimately even he with all his skill cant do much simply because of the limitations of the genre. If viewers truly want ""more realism"" as they say they do, then why turn to comics in the first place ?? Its just amazing how comic-book junkies pull the wool over their own eyes and deceive themselves into thinking that what they read is deep and sophisticated, when in fact (and there cannot be two opinions on this) reading comics beyond a certain age is a sign of neurotic behaviour. And before you shove it in my face that it is ME who is taking it too seriously, let me just say that this movie was nothing but lashes of violence : grim, sadistic violence. Once again, the so-called realism is simply a pretext for the usual action-movie gang-banging, i.e. violence and special effects. And its not even just because of the genre : Batman Begins rose above those limitations, right ? One could empathize with the young Bruce Wayne, tormented by his perceived culpability in his parents' murder, and struggling with his anger and loneliness. Not so in TDK : here there is neither plot nor motivation to speak of, and not a single character with whom one can even remotely identify. The acting, apart from one notable performance, is mediocre. To be fair, the film does take certain risks which I cant imagine the likes of, say, a Sam Raimi ever taking ; it isn't a McDonaldized blockbuster to the degree that the Spiderman films and the rest of the comic-book parade are. The problem is that those risks don't pay off : instead of an even progression of events that build up to a crescendo, what you get here is one absurdity after another until you are numb and it no longer matters who is doing what. I wonder if it is really so hard to tell the truth, even only to oneself. Apparently it is indeed SO difficult for all the fanboys to own up that the countless hours spent over the last several months, sitting up nights staring at their monitors and devouring every last bit of inconsequential trivia about TDK, have all amounted to a huge nothing. TDK is the prime example of how the advertising business works today, hyping up a product during pre-release to uncalled-for heights and ultimately forcing the gullible consumer to like the product against his better judgement. The marketing behind this film is very much THE phenomenal success story of this decade, and should serve as a de-facto case study for anyone who wants to understand just exactly how mob psychology works. EDIT : A more appropriate rating for this film is 4/10. But I so deeply despise Warner Bros. & the people lauding this film (i.e. everyone except me) that I must give it 1/10, just to balance things.",negative,4,tt0468569

"Yes, this movie is quite different. However, aside from the possibility that no one's done it before because they weren't smart/inspired/good enough to, there's also the other one.  This is a movie that fails so remarkably, you almost have to be a genius to come up with such a failure. In the one excellent scene in this movie, Edward Norton, flying on a plane from one of his constant business trips cracks a joke to his neighbour, Brad Pitt (aka Tyler Durden, here). ""very clever."" Pitt replies ""how is that going for you?"" That is both funny and poignant. The rest of the movie, however, is neither. In fact, it's just the same as poor Ed Norton - too clever for its own good. Worse yet is the reaction this movie seems to cause. Many of the others commented (and other people who've seen this movie) think that Tyler Durden is somehow the voice of good, a positive role model, if you will. And some people are completely nuts about this movie, they quote it day and night and I don't know, it's just weird. And then there's the ending. I can't give it away, but the best thing that I can say about it is that it is gimmicky. It's also pretty implausible, doesn't fit with the rest of the story and involves blowing up skyscrapers (something we now know is not a very good idea). If you're going to make a clever movie with a clever surprise ending, fine. It's possible to make a good one - The Usual Suspects for example. But having a clever movie that isn't clever enough to make sure the movie still makes any sense when the ending is revealed? A clever movie whose message is how empty cleverness is? A clever message movie? Where the message is delivered by someone who's obviously, shall we say, not very emotionally/mentally stable, to say the least? I guess you could say it's irony, but then with the same success you can say that ""Domestic Disturbance"" is a movie that makes one think 'cause it makes you think what the heck you're doing watching/paying for such an awful movie. Having said all that, this is a movie that could have been partially rescued by having a lead actress who is stunningly beautiful. Unfortunately, Helena Bonham Carter isn't. Okay, maybe it's not the most overrated movie on IMDb - after all ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is ranked #2 and ""Kingpin"" is not even on the bottom 100 at all. But it's pretty close. 1/10.

"Doom movie was not properly thought out well, well reasons could many. But I think so 'Id' Software (makers of DOOM game series) rushed on selling the license. Well its understandable after all they wanted a movie to increase awareness and also they wanted the movie to made quickly so that it is released before the next game sequel (doom 4), I'm sure if the producers and director Andrzej Bartkowiak had more time frame they could made a much more satisfying film. As far I know Id were still looking to sell the license after Doom 3 release (2004, august) and then they finally sold the license and the movie was under planning by December 2004. Then around February 2005 doom movie script was shown to public, and fans were against it and protested. According to what Dave callaham told about the movie was that the movie was not to made exactly like a game because there is a difference between a mindless action shooter game and a movie. He also said, if I'm not mistaken that Doom movie is not going to made to satisfy mindless shooting action but to increase awareness and increase the Doom universe. After all I would like to ask the people who criticize the plot that its not like the game, there is no hell concept. I have played all doom games and trust me hell concept of doom sounded completely unrealistic nonsense, only what was great about the game was gore and action. One must understand a movie cannot be made a GAME and shooter game it may try to provide some nice action but then what would be the purpose of action if the plot is completely unrealistic and senseless. The story of doom was not bad only it lacked proper explanation and depth, again another signs of the movie made in a rush, inclusion of very limited action and monsters also suggest that the movie was made in a rush. If you look at the time given to producers which was less than a year, you will agree that doom needed more time to become a good sci fi action film, either let is be time or let it be the finance to act as a catalyst in production. In the end i would rate the film 6/10, it certainly is not bad when you consider is as a movie and the fact the movie was made in a rush.

"Fight Club is a genuinely entertaining and excellently produced flick. Why fret about Plot Holes? I see that many of the reviewers here lack the ability of the suspension of disbelief. This movie most certainly requires a certain suspension of all disbelief and inane, pretentious skepticism. The movie itself does not say something momentus or particularly original about the decadence of shallow American society. In this regard it is a lot like 'The Matrix' - attempting to say something profound about our world while still captivating those short attention span high velocity flick-loving American audiences. Granted both Fight Club and the Matrix accomplish this wonderfully. But also granted, both Fight Club and the Matrix textually say things about society and reality that are at best skin deep, akin to a particularly ambitious article pondering a mainstreamed existence you would find in say 'Seventeen Magazine.'

"Christopher Nolan first brought Batman back to life with 'Batman Begins' which I unfortunately didn't see because I thought it looked drab but 'The Dark Knight' had me at the edge of my seat and in utter awe at Ledger's sadistic rebirth of the prolific character we all admire - The Joker Ledger's Joker has rapidly become a hugely iconic character and grown a massive cult behind it. After seeing the film I can admit that I have fallen in love with the latest Joker. Throughout the film i was waiting impatiently for him to come back on screen. He was a delight to watch, from the freakish tone of voice to the innovative new make up scheme. Furthermore, I think we can agree that Jack Nicholson has finally been overshadowed from his 1989 stint as the Joker. Its a huge shame that Ledger passed before he could see his character immerse movie-goers around the world. He will no doubt receive one of few posthumous Oscar nominations, whether he'll win is something we'll have to wait because it may be a close one with such other great films coming out at the end of the year. Not only was the Joker a great villain i also enjoyed Eckhart's reinvention of Two-Face. Whilst I felt that Tommy Lee Jones' creation was more entertaining, Eckhart's was intriguing with extended back story and of course excelled make-up to make him look grotesque. I also would have liked a bit more of Two-Face but the Joker was enough to compensate. Bale was also competent as Batman. He managed to achieve the cool and slick Bruce Wayne we remember but I felt his ridiculous voice of his Batman alias was very off putting. Fair enough its to conceal his identity and I suppose it make its more feasible but in the more serious scenes I was holding back the laughter because of his insanely deep voice. Anyway, the film should expect many technical Oscar nominations alongside Ironman and who knows if the ret of the films in the year are mediocre a best picture nomination?. Concluding, Nolan has resurrected Batman with ruthless effectiveness and the complex story with the irresistible performance by Ledger has made The Dark Knight a searing success. The Dark Knight is a fantastic comic book adaptation yet i feel that the public are severely over-rating it and taking it as a serious thriller. The Dark Knight must be considered a superhero film and nothing more. I feel that people are looking at Ledger's Joker rather than the film as a whole. Of course Ledger's performance is a 10 but the film is an 8. The plots not great, the script is great at places but not ground-breaking. Therefore its not a GREAT film but a GREAT SUPERHERO film. The idea that this is anywhere near the greatness of godfather and shawshank redemption or most of the films in the top 100 is absurd.

"I almost liked this movie, though the rest of the world liked it way too much!

The last time i checked, when someone gets kicked in the rib cage, it does NOT sound like a pillow being wipped with a recently used condom! Anyway, this movie is fairly simple; it is very easy to understand because everything is repeatedly spelled out for you. As a matter of fact, I already knew what the movie was going to be about when i first started seeing the commercials for it.

A mysterious voice starts giving him instructions that would eventually lead him to the window ledge 80 stories above the street. To overcome his fears and climb down would mean that he is willing to dive into a dark, dangerous, and mysterious adventure into the unknown of reality. They should have made the rest of the movie the way that window ledge scene was written- MORE ACTION, LESS YAPPING. But why is the rest of the movie so slow moving? It treats as like we're nine-year-olds! It would've been better if they gave us few hints that we can use to figure out the theme of the movie. If i were still seven years old, I would have liked this movie a lot better, but now I'm seventeen and i've already gone way deeper down the rabbit hole than this movie has taken me. It's also formulaic- perfectly designed to get rebelious type teens to empty their wallets at the box office. It is also written based on marketability rather than art so the movie ends in a visually stunning shoot out rather than tying up lose ends or giving a satisfying ending. But what disappointed me most was the characters, they're incredibly dull. None of them caught my fascination and the acting is so weak that when Neo said ""Morpheus was like a father to me"", it wasn't until then that i realized that he felt this way.

Of course the movie has holes in it which open up almost endless possibilities, but that is a reflection of the fact that Leonard did not have all the details either. His file for instance. We are left with fragments of ""memories"" just like Leonard, and are forced to actually think and try to figure it out with him. Some people don't like to think I guess, or are completely incapable. Maybe it would have been better for them if Lawrence Fishburne rambled on about all of the details for about 45 minutes with sunglasses on, all while pooching his lips out. The fact that we don't know all of the details and that the story's origin and ending do have infinite possibilities is one of the reasons that I love this film so much and is why it's so great. Brilliant, simply brilliant. Had it been done accidentally or out of tactlessness then I would think the exact opposite, but that is certainly not the case here. Sometimes a `gimmick', like filming a movie to be watched out of chronological order, can be pretentious and unnecessary, as we see in movies like 21 Grams. However, Memento's story was meant to be told this way. It's another technique that adds to the audience's lack of knowledge about what has happened in the past, exactly like Leonard's. These techniques all contribute to getting the audience to care about Leonard, and it works. Although the film is viewed backwards, all of the scenes slightly overlap each other so it's easy to follow. The director has used two different types of scenes here as well. We have the color, reverse sequence scenes that show what Leonard has been through.and we have seemingly chronological black and white scenes in which we are given tidbits of information about Leonard and his condition as he talks to an anonymous person on the telephone. Truly masterful work. This movie will leave you thinking about it for a very long time. I still like to think about the possibilities... Flawless. 10.5/10  people should be strapped in a chair and hooked to a plethysmograph and forced to watch it over and over and over..",neutral,5,tt0209144
"Lately, Pixar hasn't created anything considered perfect since Toy story 3. Cars 2 and Monsters university weren't great and didn't live up to others. But now we have this film, which is one of two Pixar films this year. When I saw this film, there was a theatrical short called ""Lava"". The short was actually awful, un-entertaining, and was like a romance music video. I give that one a 2/10. OK, on to Inside out. The film was fun, funny, and even a little complicated like the Toy story films. Before this film was released, I really doubted this film, thinking the concept would be unappealing and the writing might not be good. But this bashed my low expectations. I liked the adventure in this film because the backgrounds were excellent and made me feel like I was either in San Francisco or inside Riley's brain. The animation also made the emotions look cute, but the thing about this film is, like other Pixar films, it starred human characters in it, but the animation just creates good looking humans because its not always a good idea t make your animated film look as real as possible like ""The Polar express"". As for the characters, the emotions are sometimes funny and a little lovable. One problem is that I feel like the emotions have emotions of their own. Like there are scenes where Sadness and Anger smile like they're happy. That makes no sense since they're supposed to feel their own emotion since Joy is called Joy for example. This film doesn't have a good theatrical short, but it is still great movie that makes up for Pixar's previous disappointments (Cars 2, anyone?), and manages to blow away doubts. I hope Pixar continues this comeback with the Good dinosaur this Fall. Kinda hard to believe that Pixar would release 2 films in one year when during previous years it would be one at a time. Update July 26: When I created this review 3 weeks ago, I noticed a lot of negative reviews even though it has a 8.7 average rating. Its sad to see it have all this undeserved hate. At least tons of others have the critics point of view for this film. Plus, all this hate is coming from people who thought it was ""sad"". Sure they do have an opinion but this movie is still clever even when some parts like Bing bongs entire storyline is sad. If you watch the first 10 minutes of Up, you may understand that sad is sometimes sad in a good way. I can't wait for its home release then I can watch it over and over again. Update: This stupid troll is still going. Its down to a a8.4! WHY? Anyway, I'd like to thank the people who gave this at least a 7/10. Its beautiful and heartwarming and deserves to be in any animation hall of fame. Its just amazing SO DON'T LISTEN TO HATERS, EVERYONE! JUST BECAUSE ITS MORE SUITABLE FOR OLDER CHILDREN DOSEN'T MEAN ITS A BAD FILM! Oh, and one more FYI, its better for kids then that horrible Cat in the hat movie (This film has no adult jokes).

"Let me say straight away: See this movie. It's absolutely fantastic. It's one of only a handful (and by that I mean under five) movies where, after seeing it, I just sat in my seat in the cinema for a few moments because I was so stunned: It's that good. First of all the story-line. It's obviously counter-culture but it's doing it with it's tongue firmly lodged in it's cheek (after all it's commenting on consumerism through a Hollywood movie). It's a well paced storyline. The only detraction is that the ""twist"" is sometimes unbelievable in retrospect and can make the movie seem somewhat silly at times but I can let that slide. The acting... It's got Edward Norton. He's my favourite actor. I'm left in awe of him. He's incredibly good. He is the ultimate cynic in this movie. Brad Pitt perfectly counter-points him and once again shows he is far from being a pretty boy actor. And Mrs. Carter is just great as Marla - I'll forever see her as some bizarre Bohemian freak... And now the directing. Wow. A film like ""Lord of the Rings"" is beautiful in an epic kind of way. ""Fight Club"" is creative. There's so many creative touches that add to this movie. I knew David Fincher was one to watch after the fantastic ""Se7en"". His ability to direct also showed through on ""The Game"". Here however he surpasses himself. It's a visual treat. He keeps the story moving brilliantly. A scene that could have been rendered somewhat tiresome by another director has my jaw open here. Whether it's a bizarre montage of images, an extremely quick cinematic cut or a misaligned frame Fincher employs an array of skills to make this movie one of the most memorable looking movies that I have ever seen. In conclusion I say that I can't say enough nice things about ""Fight Club"". It's one of the best movies I've ever seen (and I've seen a fair few). I recommend that if you haven't seen it that you watch it immediately. And watch it multiple times. One of the very very few movies I'd give 10/10.",positive,10,tt0137523
"Ok so this is gonna be short and sweet. This is a comedy movie, which means it's goal and it's reason for existing is to make you laugh. I always judge a comedy movie by if it achieved that goal by making me laugh. I laughed like once, and it was at one single line, a 5 word line said by Emma Stone. Other than that, I was just in shock at the juvenile disgusting nature of nearly every single sketch. There is a way to make things that seem juvenile funny, sometimes if done right, lowbrow comedy can be funny. That is not the case here, here it's just awkward and painfully unfunny. 2/10, simply because of that one line.",negative,2,tt1333125
"I've always enjoyed a good prison series/film, but this one exceeded all others! My favorite part of the film was definitely when the main actor made an alliance with Morgan freeman! Such great chemistry there, there were also some tense moments. It is not one of them films which I can easily watch over and over simply because it is such a long film and because it takes a while to forget the plot, and if you have already watched it, the build up to seeing the main actor escape the prison is no longer a tense surprising moment.So clever and the casting was perfect! I think the film sells itself!

"I feel like I need to say something. Not only is this in the IMDb top 250, its very close to the top, sitting at #38. This means its higher than Das Boot, The Shining, The Pianist, and more than 80% of the other incredible films on this list. I don't think every movie in the top 250 is a masterpiece, but most of the ones I've seen attain a certain level of quality that sets them apart from your ""average"" movie. I rented this movie hoping it would at least be good, but I didn't even get that. There's not much to say other than every aspect was competently done but nothing exceptional (that goes for the story, performances, production value, and direction). My only real complaint would be that our two leads are a bit one dimensional. Why are rich people always stereotyped as loving classical music and listening to nothing else? Driss is a bit too erratic and clueless to be believable, but that's just me. Clearly I'm missing something because everyone seems to love this movie. If you want to check it out, I won't stop you. It's put together well enough to be enjoyed, but for me personally it left little impact, and I can think of literally hundreds of films more deserving of such a high spot on this list.

At first look at the trailer you think the movie to be just a mindless bloodfest movie, but after watching the movie you realise that the trailer only gave away the first 20 minutes of the movie or less. All in all the most pumping movie ever and it deserves much attention, even though the bloody old farts at the Academy Awards didnt seem to think so (only getting 1 nomination and that was for sound) its about time they got some new people to review the movies for Academy Award Nomination.

"Originality: 0/10. The whole ""personality attributes as characters"" thing has been done to death at least since ancient Greece. That being said, originality is not necessary for entertainment (eg: pretty much all Disney classic animated features, Shakespeare,...) Appeal to kids: 0/10. None of the characters speak or behave ""kid"". They're adults. Making adult quips and using adult language about adult topics. Even the environment wasn't ""kid"". Appeal to tweens: 2/10. Maybe tween girls would like Joy. Her look and sound were about as generic ""princess"" as you could find. Appeal to teens: 3/10. Teen girls given to deeper subjects might find the movie inventive and cool. Kind of like ""teen dystopia"" was, a few years ago. Niche. Appeal to adults: 5/10. Any parent of a tween/teen girl who has been through any drama (and all parents of tween/teen girls have or are going through drama). More for the notion of the teen girl drama than the movie itself. I couldn't see that it would appeal to teen boys at all. Although the single scene of ""inside the boy's head"" was hilariously ""spot on"" :) Appeal to tech industry adults of tween/teens (especially girls) who have relocated to the Bay Area from suburban Midwest (or suburban South): 8/10. A small group. The Bay Area is full and largely unaffordable (and unaccommodating) to incoming families. Most especially to those not receiving a pair of high tech incomes. The house the movie family moved into in SF would easily be in the $1.5- 2M range and there'd be a line of people to buy it. I don't think you can sell your $300k house and roll into a $2M fixer-upper.

Through 3 booms. And both of us originally from Midwest, but have lived all over (every major ""tech town""). I play with CGI but it wasn't even redeeming for that.

"First of all I am by no means a Shawshank hater nor I'm I here to troll the film or its fans for it being ranked this high on the IMDb top 250. Shawshank I must say is a rather enjoyable watch with a decent performance from Tim Robbins, a particular good one from Morgan Freeman, a decent storyline and a nice ending. However that said I would not put it anywhere near my top 50 movies list and I'm pretty sure I could name at least 30 films, twenty of which are not even ranked in the 250 that are IMO way better than Shawshank in their use of story telling and making you study them in your head even after you've watched them many times. It would perhaps be safe to say that what ever it does for many other people it just didn't do for me. The story was fairly predictable from start to finish and although I did appreciate its ending I found it to be too much your typical Hollywood sort of ending where every things happy and all loose ends have been tied up etc. I've now seen this movie four times and I must say I still find it to be very overrated, when I see it voted number two of all time then I think of how there are so many other movies out there not even in the 250. Oh well I guess popularity polls can never be just the way one would like them to be. Overall I give The Shawshank Redemption 6/10 stars I would have given it a seven or a eight only with the amount of high votes and rankings its got over the years on this site, I just felt it wasn't in need of such charity.

"1. Overall Plot - 9/10
I love how this is an origin story for Bruce Wayne becoming Batman. It is the only proper film to show him actually becoming Batman. Ra's Al Ghul is a perfect villain for this movie. With it being Bruce training and first starting out. I enjoy seeing a little bit of Bruce being Year One Batman, and not being the cocky playboy Bruce Wayne at first. But this doesn't last as long as it should. He should act that way for the whole film. Scarecrow being a villain in this is also cool. The plan the villains have is very interesting and actually believable. It is pretty creative, and I like the motive they have. 2. Entertainment / Engagement - 8/10
Pretty entertaining. It is very cool to see Bruce train and make his way to becoming Batman. They do a good job keeping you engaged and you never really feel bored. 3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 10/10
There is so much emotion in this. Showing Bruce's origin story, and his parents death gives you so much reason for the story. You feel why he is becoming Batman. You get pretty invested in watching Bruce train and get his gadgets. You want to see more of him as Batman. 4. Theme and Depth of Story - 10/10
The Dark Knight trilogy is very very deep. All of the dialog is great and has deeper meanings to it. There is two themes I find in this. The first one is fear. And learning to overcome your fear, and turn it into strength. The second theme I see is to always get back up. One of my favorite quotes of all time is in this movie. Thomas Wayne tells his son, ""Why do we fall Bruce? So we can learn to pick ourselves up."" It is a great quote showing that we go through hard times to get stronger. 5. Characters - 7/10
I do not like Christian Bale Batman very much. He just doesn't put much emotion into it. Especially his Bruce Wayne. He just doesn't feel like Bruce Wayne at all. His Batman is still pretty good though. Alfred is amazing in this. The way he treats Bruce and acts is just perfect. I also absolutely love Jim Gordan. He is done as perfect as you can get him. Rachel Dawes is a pretty boring love interest. But nothing terrible, just nothing special. I also enjoyed the inclusion of Lucius Fox. He is a cool character, and having him help Bruce get his gadgets and tools is awesome. Batman is done very well. He feels powerful and terrifying. 6a. Acting - 7/10
Most the actors did great. But the two leads are not very good. Christian Bale is kind of dull, especially as Bruce Wayne. And Katie Holmes is boring as Rachel. Gary Oldman did absolutely perfect as James Gordon. And Michael Caine is great as Alfred. Liam Neeson also did a good job as Ra's Al Ghul. 6b. Writing - 10/10
The writing in this is amazing. Some of the lines are the best written ever. It is what makes this movie so memorable. The Dark Knight trilogy as a whole is super deep and has amazing writing. 7a. Cinematography / Sets - 9/10
The cinematography is dark and gloomy, but that fits well for Batman. It isn't to dark that it is bothersome, and they light up things well enough to see everything going on. I love the shots showing off Gotham City, and how good it looks. Gotham is perfect in this. It is dark and rainy, but also a big and busy city. They show how full of crime and poverty it is as well. 7b. Choreography - 4/10
Not that the fighting is bad. It is just hard to see anything. They are constantly cutting the camera and moving it around. It is blurred a lot and just hard to tell exactly what's going on. It does feel very fast paced though which is great. 8. Score / Sound - 8/10
The music is very good. It feels like Batman music. I love how serious it feels. It keeps you in the action, and helps you feel the intensity of the plot. I hate Christian Bale's Batman voice. Yes it's more scary. But it just is kind of stupid. It is too raspy and deep. It is better when Batman's voice sounds real and disguised. 9. Editing / Pace - 6/10
The editing could be better. Specifically the fight scenes. There is just too much cutting and shaking. It makes it harder to see what's going on. Other than the fights the editing is fine. The pacing isn't bad. But it could be better. It is just hard to get a scope on the timeline of this movie. It takes place over a very long time but doesn't really feel like it. 10. VFX/Practical Effects - 8/10
The effects felt pretty good for the most part. There was a few times they looked bad, but for the time I think it was still pretty good. And Batman looked good the whole time. Average Score:
8/10 My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts:
8.5/10
I love that this is an origin story. It makes the film. This film is also automatically better because of the Dark Knight trilogy as a whole. I personally just don't think Christian Bale is the best Batman actor, but he's still pretty good.",neutral,5,tt0372784
"OK, I REALLY don't get it. I always thought: ""Oh well, the Godfather, masterpiece, everyone has to watch it at least once in their live, let's see it then (someday)"". Then today I finally decided myself to watch it and I was shocked about it. To make it short, it was boring, WAY to long for the amount of real action (and I don't mean Micheal bay action, I mean something like a traceable storyline that doesn't introduce new names and character every time something really happens (and thats not often the case) so that in the end, you don't even know who's who and what is really happening. I don't like a film where you don't know who is doing the action you see, especially if some of the main characters are so similar that you can't distinguish them in some scenes. Also, the film is too long. Take the first set for example, the wedding (or was it a wedding?). If you count all the minutes you see some macaroni's dancing without sense or entertaining the viewer, I think it's around 5 to 10mins. If you look at that you know why the movie is around 3 hours long. Coming to the characters, I didn't have any emotional relationship to them after 3 hours of nearly non-stop conversation. I didn't really care when they died, first because in most cases, I didn't know who was killed in the scene most times and second, because I had no emotions for them. (Let's take that scene near the end, where all the people get killed, like 5 or 6 in three different locations. I didn't even recognize one of them, the whole scene didn't make sense for me. Why would they shoot a women with their child in the bed, especially if the viewer doesn't know who (the f**k) she is??? Not really a pro for a so-called ""masterpiece"") The only two pros I have are the acting and the music. I have to say I'm not a pro in commenting acting in films (watched Catwoman and didn't have a clue why Halle Berry became the golden raspberry for their acting after learning all that stuff with the walking like a cat, martial arts etc.). But I have to say what I've seen in this film is the most natural acting possible. None of the scenes looks contrived, the ""we are all family"" part came very good. Also the soundtrack is really worth recognizing. To sum it up: Acting: 10/10 Storyline: 4/10 (really disappointing) Action: 3/10 (even more disappointing) Lenght: 2/10 Soundtrack: 8/10 Overall: Around 4-5/10, I'll give it 4 because it's overrated.

"Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is based on the autobiography of Jordan Belfort, who, using loopholes in the law, created a multimillion-dollar brokerage empire out of nothing, lived the 'American dream' and ended up in prison. ""My name is Jordan Belfort. I'm a former member of the middle class raised by two accountants in a tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens. The year I turned 26, as the head of my own brokerage firm, I made $49 million, which really pissed me off because it was three shy of a million a week."" The film was flawlessly shot (nominations for best film and directing) and, although it lasts for three hours, it is not boring for a moment, and for the most part it is even very entertaining. Leonardo DiCaprio excelled in the lead role, but, as usual, remained only on the Oscar nomination. He is supported by Jonah Hill (also an Oscar nominee), Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, and many other not-so-famous, but no less good actors. If you are looking for a dramatic but humorous portrayal of life on a high but shaky leg, a newly rich man who lives fast in crazy sex, drugs, and more drugs manner, you are in the right place. To gain some idea of the explicitness and decadence in the film, it is interesting to note that DiCaprio once cited the Tinto Brass' ""Caligula"" (1979) as an inspiration and role model for making this movie. ""Let me tell you something. There's no nobility in poverty. I have been a rich man and I have been a poor man. And I choose rich every time. Because, at least as a rich man, when I have to face my problems, I show up in the back of the limo, wearing a $2000 suit and a $40,000 gold watch."" But, although this story has some indication of social criticism and the potential for a deeper and more serious film, it still remains in the domain of a typical American blockbuster, without much substance and point. 7,5/10.",neutral,5,tt0993846
"A moment to rejoice! Welcome to Phase 3 of the MCU. First things first, clever writing from the Russo brothers. After a long time (since Spidey's Homecoming) the critics are totally in sync with me. Last month I watched Black Panther, and thought it was media-hyped! But today, I found something refreshing. This is the best Avengers assembly ever made! I watched A:IW in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the galaxy, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen with a slight chopping of the picture. The images are larger than life. Although they don't confuse the eye but I am still having a strain. Along with 12,000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing! It may have taken 10 years and 18 movies, but the superheroes have shown redemption. This may have room in the hall of fame! Spider-man is just a teenage boy but yes,Tony Stark can convince any one and it was watching both of them together again. Thor appreciates Roger's beard. And the suits even support the tone of the film. Some people in the theater started crying in the end, but I didn't. I don't want to spoil anything, so save your bucks for this blockbuster.

"I recently saw Panic Room, which was so commercial it brought up an old question. A question which I thought was interesting enough to write a second Fight Club comment about (trust me, it's the first and only time). So why does a movie attacking consumerism contain the flashiest style you've ever seen? Why is it so spectacular? For the same reason it's loaded with advertising messages (check all those Starbucks cups!). It's not hypocrisy, it's irony. To get the movie's messages to a large audience, it has to be flashy and spectacular, because else we probably wouldn't be watching. We are all part of the same hypocrisy, especially the filmmakers (didn't anybody see the irony in casting pretty-boy Brad Pitt, having him criticize the Calvin Klein-ideal of a man only to show off his hard abs a couple of scenes later?). The film is counter-culture but all counter-culture is part of the culture it's rebelling against. To deny that, to deny this film was made to make money; that would've been hypocritical. What it does instead, is realise the inherent problem in adapting a book into an art form that is almost by definition commercial (you can't afford to make movies nobody's willing to pay to see) and play into that. It exaggerates Hollywood conventions to a level where it's kind of ridiculous. It doesn't attack the stylistics themselves but our preoccupation with seeing them (much like it doesn't attack personal property but consumerism instead - there's a significant difference). It gives us what we want (exactly the same goes for the movie's ending) but in a way that's so over the top you can't help but look at it with a big smile on out faces. And big smiles is what this film is after as much as contemplation. Fight Club is not some heavy study of today's society and it certainly doesn't provide all the answers to the questions it poses. It's a comedy and a smart one too, because it realises sometimes merely highlighting the questions is enough. Fight Club is not fascist, not hypocritical and not the answer (as another commenter already pointed out; if you liked it, you're probably part of the problem). Fight Club just is.

"I saw Two Towers for the second time today and have totally changed my mind about the movie. After the first viewing I found the changes from the book incredibly jarring and unnecessary. I rated it 5/10. As one who has read the books about seven times over a twenty year period the first viewing was like watching a very expensive train crash. It seemed distant and unfamiliar, perhaps because I had watched the FOTR DVDs too many times. However, as I knew what changes to expect the second time I could enjoy the movie for what it was and it was fantastic. Sure the  changes were many but the essence of the book was there. It had the right feel. If you are a purist and you hated the movie do yourself a favor. Open your mind and see it again. Don't fight it, just let it flow. Don't force yourself to like it. My only real gripe. Someone other than Gimli should have been the voice of Treebeard - it sounded way too much the same.Is Brian Blessed still acting. He would have been awesome.

"Again, the best. There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now. True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be. The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate. Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it. The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated. In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox.",positive,10,tt0068646
"Strange movie with some twists - ala Hitchcock.  But it was a bit  wierd. Story would go forwards and backwards.  The ""mementos"" were just not that realistic to be believed.  It seemed the guy lost his short term memory for most things but not where he put his little memos.  He always managed to find those - even the new ones.  An amazing feat for someone with zero short term memory.  And throughout the film he would constantly make notes and read the notes - but he never seemed to be bothered with the thousands of tatoos he had.  He belonged in a lunatic asylum.  I never would have guessed a film about some chowderhead writing and reading sticky notes would've been so popular.  Should've been called the sticky note boy. 6/10",neutral,6,tt0209144
"I really liked ""The Godfather"" and the content of the movie. But, I think that this movie is overrated. Back in the 70's, this might have been the greatest movie ever. But in 2009, it's not. This film talks about the rivalry between the 5 Italian mafia families living in New York City. The main focus is on the Corleone family. After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance. The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever. The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months. One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in. This movie is nearly three hours long. I can accept that for the last LOTR movie because it's interesting and engaging. Overall, this is a great film, not exactly a masterpiece. I rate this film 8/10.",positive,8,tt0068646
"The Godfather (1972) is a masterpiece that I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on Paramount+. The storyline follows an American mafia family with a Godfather who is a direct descendant from Italy. As the father gets older and close to dying and handing down his power within the family he fields a series of asks, favors and political placement requests for power within the underground world. This movie is directed by Francis Ford Coppola (Apocalypse Now) and stars Marlon Brando (A Streetcar Named Desire), Al Pacino (Scarface), James Caan (Misery), Diane Keaton (Annie Hall), Robert Duvall (Slingblade), Talia Shire (Rocky) and Abe Vigoda (Joe versus the Volcano). The performances by the entire cast in this movie is outstanding with especially powerful performances by Brando and Pacino and strong supporting performances by Duvall, Caan and Shire. The soundtrack and settings are legendary. This film makes you want to book a trip to Italy immediately. The mafia wedding to start the movie is so well executed and as is the evolution of Pacino's character. The dialogue is brilliantly written and the cast delivers every line with the right level of intensity. The ending a perfect way to end the movie and show the power and struggle of being The Godfather. Overall this is a cinematic masterpiece that is an absolute must see. I would score this an easy 10/10.",positive,10,tt0068646
"You'll pardon me for not concurring that this is Spielberg's best film in years (and Lord knows that he keeps sucking my wife and I into those $8.50 box-office tickets anyway). ""Minority Report"" has been called the antithesis of this so-called 'breezy' film (because the parents in CMIYC ""care"" -- or at least one of them does) but that's giving Spielberg way too much credit. A word of advice: don't watch ""The Grifters""  (which I did the night before viewing this mess), possibly the best con film this side of ""The Sting."" Hell, don't even see the underrated ""Harry in Your Pocket"" or even ""The Flim-Flam Man"" before checking out this ultimate con of your $$$. Funnily enough, the biggest con here is Steve grabbing the money he lost when you didn't see ""A.I."" or ""Minority Report."" And what a mess it is: Tom Hanks manages the worst Massachusetts accent since the lamentable Costner's in ""Thirteen Days"" (and I'm one of the film snobs who actually LIKES Hanks -- his turn in this year's ""Road to Perdition"" is worthy of a nomination: not a win, mind you, but a nod). Hanks' accent wouldn't be a problem if he wasn't in approximately every other scene. The Saul Bass-inspired opening creds (think ""Pink Panther"" flix) and cool initial John Williams score suggests a fun retro film, but this just isn't. It's ""Ocean's Eleven"" sans the cool. Dispensible characters come and go with no follow-up whatsoever (Jennifer Garner in a truly ""what's she doing here?"" cameo, Marty Sheen and his daughter-character -- who are actually important to the story, but disappear when their usefulness subsides: basically 10 minutes after their arrival). Though ""based on actual events,"" several interludes smell like Spielberg inventions, not the least of which are Leo's 'just missing' being caught episodes, which play out here like old Marx Bros. sketches -- without Groucho and Harpo and Ms. Dumont. By the way, Leo's pretty good here (how can this 28-year-old still look 16?). But while watching the film I couldn't help but wonder what the book was like -- and comparing Frank Abagnale, Jr.'s exploits as portrayed here to those of the fellow from Michigan who was arrested a few years back. The latter not only impersonated doctors, airline pilots and more but actually performed operations, flew planes, etc. From memory, the guy was the greatest impostor in history. Oh wait, there *was* that old Tony Curtis film, ""The Great Impostor"" -- maybe I'll have to check that out again as well. Christopher Walken's most endearing role ever (?) in a nice turn as Leo's dad can't overcome the average DP work, Hanks' worst performance in a few years, a really shoddy script and, well, STEVE. Catch it not. But *do* rent ""The Grifters."" Or ""Ocean's Eleven""... even the original. No wait -- stick with the *other* Steven's version ;) 4/10 Out",negative,4,tt0264464
"I finally went to see it Monday night. After all and that has been said about this movie, i thought it was good, not great. I enjoyed it a little. The movie could have been cut down by at least 30 minutes. There was a lot of talking. Maggie Gyllenhaal was absolutely disgusting and hard to watch. I'm getting sick of Christian Bale's batman voice. It just gets annoying after a while. His voice was cool in batman begins, but he's just forcing it so much! You even see him spit a few times. I'll suspended belief a little bit for each superhero movie, even batman bending the barrel of a machine gun. Linking millions of phones together without the help of Luscious Fox? How did that even occur? that was kind of a heart breaking moment for me where I said to myself, ""I'm not going to believe this so this movie can succeed."" I never thought of Heath Ledger as a good actor or someone i'd say, ""oh he's in that movie lets go see it!"" but he was amazing in this movie. If it wasn't for the way he portrayed the joker this movie might not be getting the praise it is. I thought he'd actually have more scenes, like the Nicholson joker, but he didn't. There was a lot of talk about how dark this movie is and even how dark batman is in it. I didn't really get that from this movie. I was hoping it would be even more dark and eerie. I think my favorite part is when the joker is driving down the street and sticking his head out the window and there is no sound - now that was eerie. A lot of sappy parts that cut down on the darkness of the movie. Oh, I wasn't exactly thrilled that they took over an hour in the previous batman to explain how Batman got started and how the Scarecrow guy got started but didn't explain how the joker got started. there is no rhyme without reason. Why is the joker the way he is? back story? anything? nope.. They even managed to squeak in how Harvey Dent turned into two-face. Gotham looked a lot like Chicago, what if they had to go to chicago, when they're in gotham?! I mean they managed to go to Hong Kong! Ironman was better or maybe I just think ironman was better because I didn't expect it to be as good as i thought it was. Stop giving this movie 10/10.

"Star Wars Episode 4 A New Hope tells the story of a farm boy Luke Skywalker who upon his purchase of two droids R2-D2 and C3-P0, and running into the old and wise Obi-Wan Kenobi he is thrown into a world bigger then his own. A New Hope has great sense of pacing and having a flowing narrative build up to its conclusion almost flawlessly. The characters feel like real people with fleshed out motivations. The effects although aged today definably inspired what we have today in the art of cinema. The score just like all the other films in the saga is fantastic. But what this movies greatest feat is just how much it inspired a generation of cinema, as well as is outstanding impact on pop culture that keeps this film fresh. In spite of how much we can all appreciate this movies impact it is still far from a perfect movie. Most of the acting is hooky, and the effects are hard to by today. And although it has a good sense of pacing it still has many plot conveniences. The action is also pretty slow which prevents it from feeling like a real fight is going on. Even the dialogue is pretty hooky and hard to by. This is a problem because if characters are unable to talk like people do it makes it hard to relate to them and get invested in there conflicts. In conclusion I can appreciate its impact on culture, as well as love the movie. I personally consider myself to be a Star Wars fan. Keeping in mind that I feel on an objective level I consider this picture to be above average instead of great I'm giving this one a 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0076759
"It's hard to define the standards of what makes a good sci-fi movie but, IMO, they must challenge and question our concepts of the world as it is and where it's heading. Whether they paint an optimistic or darker portrait of the future, they should avoid merely projecting present trends into the future and try instead to focus on all aspects of human society. The Matrix tries very hard to fall into that categorie but it fails on all accounts. The movie owes a lot of its mass appeal to the fact that it combines a number of things that are highly popular in modern culture. Among these is the age-old cliche concept of ""me-against-a-large-scale-ennemy-entity"". When I was a teenager, I went to see every sci-fi movie in which Charlton Heston played. I thought he was so cool the way he wielded guns and pitted himself against a mob of vampires or a totalitarian police state that wanted to control and dominate people. Today, Keanu Reeves has filled in for ol' Charlton who's still in love with guns. Sci-fi movies may have gotten more sophisticated, thanks to computer imagery and SFX, but in other aspects, they seldom offer innovation and originality. The idea that the physical world is an artificial construct meant to deceive us is not new and original. Sci-fi writers such as Alfred Bester or Philip K Dick have used it in their novels way back in the '50s and '60s. Recommendation? At its best, this movie is a roller coaster ride filled with terrific stunts and special effects. Much like Total Recall. If that's your idea of a good movie, then go for it. It will meet your expectations. At its worst, it's a silly combination of computer games, martial arts, sci-fi and film noir style and look. The characters portrayed have as much deepness as the typical comic book heroes. Add to that the naive pretention that computer hackers and information technology will eventually help us save the world and you've got one of the most absurd movies of all times. Still worth renting if you haven't seen it, just for curiosity's sake. Trendy? Yes, all the way. Prophetic? You gotta be kidding! Rating: 5/10",neutral,5,tt0133093
"I'm not a fan of this type of movies, but since I like Al Pacino and I've heard so much about this so-called ""legendary"" Godfather, I decided to give it a try. I must say this is the most inexplicably overrated piece of trash I've ever seen. Judging from this opening statement I know that these film lovers will aggressively spout out and say that I am 100 percent from about the Godfather... BELIEVE ME when I say that it shouldn't be in the same breath as one of the greatest. Don't get me wrong however, there are a few good qualities which in some way does kind of show some good hallmarks for a good film. The tempo right from the start of the film isn't too bad as it does set a nice tone to the film and kind of signifies what sought of film this will be. In some parts the acting of Marlon Brando as the 'Don' and Al Pacino as Michael do put up good performances which again add's to that verisimilitude to not only the story but to the other characters that are within this film. Although these small film aspects can add to your experience of watching the Godfather, non of this excruciates from the fact that these good factors do have harsh limitations which evidently create more problems throughout the duration of the film. Even though I did say from the start that the tempo and the duration of the scenes and music is perfect in introducing the characters and some of the story aspects, this is all it does unfortunately. As it gets near enough to the middle point of the film, the whole story and tempo falls flat on it's face and in most parts of when they are talking to some other gang leaders does emphasise this point that sometimes in the film, some of the story elements don't really add up to which personal for me creates a lot of boredom. Another sought of example of this is perfectly clear when the character of Michael is in Italy to lay low from the killings that he committed... I find that the Italia sequence is a complete waste of time and primarily add's to this excuse of being nearly a 3 hour film which really it shouldn't be. This sequence just kills the flow and intensity of what will eventually happen; it postpones the inevitable in some fashion. Although again I did say that the acting from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is exceptionally fine, the majority of their performances not only add's to this lack of entertainment, but in a sense just makes me want to never watch this film ever again. Marlon Brando speaking with a husky voice and cotton in his mouth is incredibly ridiculous. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone suddenly turns, from a principled man who doesn't want to have anything to do with murder, into a ruthless criminal. What? This character has no depth, no consistency whatsoever. His relationships with women are so poorly portrayed, they add nothing to his development. If you want to see a good gangster film then personally I recommend watching 'The Departed' as it does have the same sought of Genre and does everything right in terms of it's interesting story telling between these two men which at times does have lot's of quirky but violent scenes in which is done perfectly right rather than have old men constantly talk non stop about mundane meaningless ideals.

"I had high hopes in this movie with all the positive reviews I saw. But in the end it became the worst movie I saw in my life. In other words, I was disgusted by just seeing him, I couldn't stand being in my seat, I wanted to stop and change the movie. And that's saying a lot. There is a Mexican novel that I thought was the worst in history. I was wrong Starting with the disastrous script that was not going anywhere, someone tell the director that he is making a movie, the dialogues looked like those of a book. I never read it, but it shows that it was copied faithfully. I felt as if the author was smoking marijuana while writing the book, there is quite a chance that it is true. It was an insult to writers who at least know that someone is going to read their works and they take seriously the construction of the plot by making a beautiful rise and fall with the subplots. Arriving at a conclusive climax. Contrary to the fight club that throws up the viewer showing random scenes without relevant content and sex scenes or related things without context that did not contribute to the plot just because, ""I am very depressed and edgy"" In the end it is only a film that was the most popular because certain stupid Yanks had never seen any work related to depression and went to the first film they saw of that style and called it a masterpiece to reflect their pathetic life in that. 1/10",negative,1,tt0137523
"I did not enjoy this film.  Yes, I enjoyed the special effects, which were beyond superb, but it takes more than special effects to get me to enjoy a movie.  When the Matrix was released, these effects were amazing, something brand new and outrageous, but now they are nothing unusual and when you take away that aspect of the film, you get nothing.  You get a stupid, uninteresting plot and a cast of terrible actors, minus Laurence Fishburne. Not that the actors are terrible, just their acting in this movie is terrible. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano both prove they can act in Memento, but here they just flop. And I can't believe that Keanu Reeves gets cast for any movies because he is just plain miserable, one of the worst actors ever to enter the business.  Plot and acting are two things I look for ahead of special effects in a movie. I can enjoy a movie that has absolutely no special effects whatsoever and was filmed with an amateur home video camera, as long as the plot and acting are good.  This movie, with a huge budget, wasted all of it on special effects and none of it on teaching the actors how to act or paying the Wachowski's to improve the script and to learn how to direct. Such a stupid movie, and I can't figure out why it is so popular.  Because it was the first to introduce such effects?  Does that mean one must automatically love the original, just because it was the first? The Matterhorn Mountain at Disneyland was the first roller coaster to introduce steel tubular track, but is it my favorite steel roller coaster?  No. Coca-Cola was released before Pepsi-Cola, but is Coke my favorite soft drink?  No.  So why must this movie be everyone's favorite just because it was the first to introduce these visual effects?  I don't know and won't know.  The only answer I ever hear from people as to why they loved this movie is ""Well didn't you see the special effects?""  Screw the special effects.  Give me Memento, a movie with virtually no special effects.  Give me Field of Dreams.  Philadelphia.  Even My Dog Skip.

"Fight Club is a slick combination of art and entertainment. Ultimately, it's a cautionary tale of consumerism's breeding and antagonization of toxic masculinity. Through the chaos, Fight Club offers emotional vulnerability as the solution to that vicious cycle. Indeed, this narrative is as relevant as ever. Plus, Pitt and Norton bring intense passion to their roles. Norton fluidly evolves from dejected, to invigorated, to overwhelmed, to empowered. Meanwhile, Pitt is at his absolute best, forcefully embodying his cult of personality. Collectively, these dynamics produce a perfect storm of commentary, impact, and relatability that will draw a reaction from all viewers. Simultaneously, Fincher creates an existential atmosphere that feels both alluring and unhinged. Visually, this is done with symbolic colors, hypnotic camerawork, and surreal composition. The audio contributes with meta narrations, psychological distortions, and exaggerated sounds. The editing has a super-charged structure and tempo, melding realities and giving the film a dreamlike quality. Additionally, the production design blends chic with decay, the effects are modern yet gritty, and the soundtrack ends with the best song possible (all of which underscore the themes). Overall, Fight Club is a masterpiece of contemporary angst and a punch of renegade art. Writing: 10/10

"""The Fast and the Furious"" is probably the best comedy of 2001. An impressive feat, considering it isn't supposed to be a comedy. Somewhere amongst all the ridiculous looking fluorescent sports cars (are these things really supposed to be ""cool""?), the inane dialogue,  the annoying music, and Paul Walker (that guy can't act his way out of a wet paper bag) we get a plot that's a complete rip-off of ""Point Break"" and racing scenes that are laughably overdone and NOT INTERESTING.

"If I could give this film an 11/10 I would. It is by far my favourite movie that I have ever seen. The other two Nolan Batman movies are awesome too, but there is something special about this one. It is flawless, from start to finish. I love everything about it. The writing is really smart, lots of good moral and philosophical ideas, this interpretation of The Joker is incredible. The writing is inspired and Heath Ledger's performance is stunning, he steals every scene he is in. I think it is tragic that he died before this was released, because he deserved to see just how much people loved his work in this movie. I think I want to watch this movie again soon, they just don't make movies like this anymore. If they did it now then Batman would have to be LGBT and black and Robin would be a woman who takes no rubbish from men and can do anything a man can do, and the Joker would just be a blonde haired blue eyed white guy who just can't accept that the world is changing, and commissioner Gordon would be trans or something, I really really hate the way the world is now. It wouldn't surprise me if IMDB those puppets of the establishment censor my review for being to full of red pills. I really should have been born in the time of don quixote, I haven't read that book yet, but I am familiar with the overall story, I really feel like I relate to that character, trapped in a world he does not understand full of cruel evil s*** demons, who just wants to have wild adventures as a brave knight and win the hearts of fair maidens, but instead I'm trapped here in this repulsive clown world. Anyway, back to the review. I don't know who actually reads this stuff, but 'don't forget to like and subscribe'... It is an all time classic. Jack Nicholson was a great Joker, and so was joahin (not sure how to spell his name) phoenix, and Mark Hamil in the Batman cartoon is great, but for me Heath Ledger was by far the best Joker that there ever was. I'm going to pretend that Jared Leto's never happened. It wasn't just that his Joker was bad, it was that he did like 9 months of pretentious method acting and it still sucked, what is that about? I wish I had a Men In Black memory wiper to forget all about his version, but it doesn't really matter, because Heath Legend was the best (see what I did there) by far, he can terrorise my city anytime with his dark psychotic oddly funny mind games any time. This performance also inspired one of my favourite memes of all time 'It costs literally $0 not to say the (censored word) it's not about the money, it's about sending a message! FIRE!!!

"I can not see why people find this movie creepy or even remotely interesting. After 20-30 minutes it's so obvious how this movie will end. I won't ''spoil'' it for those of you who haven't seen it yet, but it's hard to understand almost nobody feels it coming from miles ahead. It's so darn _obvious_! Well, not to brag, but I have probably seen too much movies. Like with The Blairwitch Project, which is supposed to be scary... Give me a break, please.

"Being near the top of the bottom 100 list here at IMDB seems to have given this trash heap (and several other cinematic travesties) a lot of sympathy from numerous folks. Well, disregard them. Please, please do. Don't subject yourself to the pain that is MANOS - the Hands of Fate. This film is truly the WORST movie I have ever seen, in all my years. I know that's not something that should be thrown around very lightly - it's a pretty big statement. But in all honesty, I think I'm dead-on in the assumption that no film is as bad as this trash. I've watched numerous other no-budget Blockbuster-bargain-bin slashers, I've seen a LOT of random, obscure B-movies on MST3K and from other random sources, I've exposed myself to oldschool drive-in fluff. But none of it, NONE, has truly come close to the awful experience of seeing this movie. Marketed as a horror movie, MANOS would have been a hit with a switch-a-roo in its genre - selling it to insomniacs as a cure would have been very successful. The film starts off with a father (Director, Writer, Producer, and Fertilizer Salesman Hal Warren), A mother (who didn't live long after the completion of this movie), a daughter, and her little poodle. It isn't long (actually, yes, it is. And I do mean it is. For about 20 minutes at the beginning of the film all that happens is soft elevator music plays as the group drives across the fields of Texas in midday. And it goes on. And on. And on. Oh, the pain.) before... wait, where was I? Oh yeah, this movie sucks. After the painfully boring and devoid-of-dialogue opening driving scenes, we meet a couple of teens necking out on the highway. A cop stops them (hey, it's 1966,) and they go off to neck somewhere else. They really never had any significance that I can remember, but I read that they were going to have bigger parts until the gal in the car broke her leg. So writer/director/farmer Warren thought it'd be nice to still have them 'cameo' or something. Either way, the scenes still suck. But that leads me to the next point. MANOS was shot with a camera that records no sound - that's right, every line was dubbed by 2 people. A man, and a woman. This results in terrible voiceovers (the little girl actually sounds like a 40 year old woman mocking a 5 year old toddler, and hillarity unintentionally ensues when Hal is pulled over by a cop and you can't tell who's talking because the same person dubbed their voice). On other audio issues, while the music doesn't itself suck, per se, it is absolutely out of place in a 'horror' movie. The elevator music is out of place at the beginning. The Torgo theme could have been memorable if it had been used in more memorable places. The jazzy solos don't help the 'horror' movie at all, and the whacky music that plays during the scenes where the wives beat each other up certainly doesn't make anyone scared (and, in fact, makes it reminiscent of old silent comedy films that had similar music.) The script is ineptly written, the acting is terribly done (most people in this movie either killed themselves or never appeared in films after this one, or both,) there is no spooky, thrilling, scary, or even unintentionally funny atmosphere throughout the whole piece. It's almost physically painful to watch the actors stumble through the film, and the dubbed voiceovers (and it shows that the dubbers really did try to fit each part, but failed miserably) all add up to a terrble experience. In my movie watching experiences it's often that I find horrible movies that make me laugh. I'm sure many others have similar experiences, but this film is devoid of any of that. There is truly not a single redeeming quality in this film. Spare yourself the pain. Truly the worst movie I've ever seen - 0/10",negative,0,tt0060666
"I wasn't so sure what to expect, either a very brutal and a disturbing movie or an intelligent and an exciting thriller. Well, it was brutal at parts, disturbing at times, but it still managed to be an intelligent and an exciting thriller all the way through, a true diamond for the thriller -genre. The movie tells about two homicide detectives, an experienced veteran detective Somerset who's about to retire from his job and another detective Mills, a rookie who's supposed replace Somerset after he's retired. They soon team up together when they find out that there's a serial killer who commits his murders by choosing victims who each represent one of the Seven Deadly Sins. A perfect plot for a thriller indeed. I just mentioned about the plot being perfect for a thriller, but does the screenplay manage that perfection? Oh yes, it does. The screenplay (written by Andrew Kevin Walker) is absolutely amazing, along with the whole storytelling. The whole movie is exciting and thrilling throughout all the way from the beginning till the end by not making one single stop or telling any irrelevant subplots. It focuses on the main theme, the whole progress of solving a crime in a very detailed way, making it undeniably one of the best thrillers ever made. Another thing mentioned above is that it was brutal and disturbing at times, but it still doesn't take it over the top. I could describe those parts as being important for the film itself. By showing these brutal things it makes you alert and sort of scared, and really makes you despise the unnatural murderer who's behind the horrible crimes. You really start to live the movie itself, you want to catch the criminal and make him pay what he has done. That is because the absolutely brilliant storytelling the movie has, also giving it a very good flow which causes the 2 hours go in a blink of an eye. That is what a real flow should all be about, making a 3 hour long massive epic movie seem like only a 30 minute short film. That is what ""Se7en"" manages, a flow that's just so good it's a real pleasure for eyes to see. The directing is close to excellence and it is lead by David Fincher whose work I will most certainly be observing in the future, as I was so pleased on the result he managed with ""Se7en"". Fincher sort of follows the whole story as it should, translating the screenplay on the screen in a very successful and an entertaining way. The movie also got nominated for an Academy Award back in 1996 in the category of Best Film Editing. To be honest, I immediately noticed how detailed it actually was, how it made that flow even better scene after a scene. It makes the whole movie more immense and stirring, backed up by the great cinematography which gives the movie that dark edge it needs. The music's just gorgeous, building up the tension and making your heart beat very fast when there's these highly intensive scenes, giving the whole movie that final touch. It is composed by one of my favourite composers Howard Shore and to be honest the music is very much like Shore. I can't describe it more precisely, but if you're familiar with his work you know what I'm talking about. Starring Morgan Freeman as detective William Somerset and Brad Pitt as detective David Mills a thriller couldn't ask more from the lead actors. Both role performances are outstanding and both actors are very convenient in their roles. Morgan Freeman happens to be one of my favourite actors of all time and he's indeed one of those actors you just have to admire because to me the man hasn't done one single bad role performance in his career. Freeman is very convincing as detective Somerset, giving the character that Freeman -edge it needs, being wise and witty, a perfect mentor. I must admit that Brad Pitt also happens to be one of my favourite actors and as detective Mills he does a superb job, making the character what it's all about, the one with the looks, being fierce and serious. Both of the characters have this very realistic depth in them. To me Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt were one of the best pair teams I've ever seen on the screen, they just compliment each other's performances so well it just almost makes me shed a tear. ""Se7en"" is all in all an amazing movie. Surely one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. It's intensive, immense, exciting, detailed and thrilling, just what all thrillers should be like. Everything seems to click in this film; Brilliant screenplay, directing close to excellence, great characters and even better role performances, intensive cinematography and music that just captures the whole essence of the thriller -genre. Despite the fact of it being somewhat brutal at parts it really doesn't matter in the end, it still isn't that tasteless over the top violence the horror -genre seems to have, so you shouldn't even worry about what I said about it. I'm not saying it's a movie suitable for children, I'm saying it's a movie where even the brutal and disturbing scenes are made with a good taste and a classy style. I'd give it a 9.5/10, but as that is impossible it has to satisfy with the more than deserved 9. All this gives you an absolutely guaranteed motion picture experience, it does it smoothly and it does it with style. A thriller among the best.",neutral,5,tt0114369

"The Lord of the rings is number one in the top 250 of imdb. How is it possible ? The Tolkien lobby has voted blindly ? Of course, it is not a bad movie. I would even say it is a very good first part. But I would not be astonished if the second one and the third one are better. This ""Fellowship of the  ring"" is the set up of the serial. We discover the characters, their personalities and doubts. What The Phantom Menace did not do. But there are a few lacks like some SFX which are truly dreadful (the cavetroll looks like Shrek which is not very realistic). The story is well adapted and you never fell that it lasts 2h45. But please, it is not because of Tolkien and a few battles that this movies deserves 9.6/10. What about The Two towers for example ? 11.7/10 ?

That was a much better stripper movie, although it was more of skimpy clothes dancing rather that the full monty.

Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame. Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more. If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.

What blew me away about 'The Matrix' and made it my favourite movie of all time, was the discovery of what *the matrix* is. The screenwriters successfully accomplished the task of making the plot be original and deep. The characters were too cool (not to mention the wardrobe!)--the cast did a beautiful job. And last but not least (and what attracted me to go watch the movie in the first place) the directing and visual effects that made this movie unique from all others, and that sparked off a trend for how future science fiction and/or action movies are shot for a long time to come--that 'Bullet Time' concept--it was excellent to watch.

"After the Last Jedi, countless Star Wars fans are now turning their heads at the franchise, and, at least for Solo, they have a reason. Unlike The Force Awakens, this movie lacks the charm that came from seeing this world in another adventure. Ron Howard (Director) and the rest of the cast (except for Woody Harrelson and Donald Glover) and crew bring nothing new to the table, lore and all. While there is some positives, like a fun heist and chase scene or two, a couple of good performances, and some interesting locations, Solo is bland in its presentation and full of the tiring adventure heist movie cliches people have come to expect.

"Verdict? Truly awful. The choreography for the fight scenes are laughable. When a film contains a 'superman' who can take on a dozen men all at the same time, clearly we're entering into the world of fantasy and for the film to work it has to be played for laughs. The main problem with the film is that it took itself too seriously. Or rather Jason Statham played it too seriously. Statham has to be the worst actor in living memory, and seemed to be incapable of showing any expression or emotion in his cold, lifeless eyes. He just about gets away with it in, 'Oceans eleven' probably because he occupies so little screen time. To give you an example of Statham's acting in the film, in one scene his house is blown up. How are you going to feel if your house is blown up? Angry? Mildly irritated perhaps? -Not if you're Jason Statham. Having just seen his house destroyed and turned into complete rubble, his face doesn't register even the slightest muscle movement. He just can't act. Maybe, he should have watched Gene Hackman's turn in, 'Enemy of the State' when his house his destroyed for a few pointers. Even at the end of the film where he's reunited with his love interest, you'd think if there was ever an opportunity to smile and show a bit of life, this was it. What does he do? Same static, lifeless expression. Painful. Given that the whole premise of the film is that Statham is the best 'transporter' there is, transporting packages from one location to the next, no questions asked, you'd think there'd be a few good car chases to demonstrate why he is supposedly the best. And is there? Not, in this film. Badly acted. Badly written. Badly choreographed. Truly awful. 3/10",negative,3,tt0293662

"Leonardo DiCaprio acts great in this movie, Jonah Hill, acts his usual self, trying to be funny, but ultimately failing. The cinematography is good, but a movie like this one was too quirky for its own good. Way over the top with every theme in the film. Another issue I had with this film was the glamorization of, really, just a bad human being (Jordan Belfort). The consequences don't seem to effect the protagonist much, and really I can't root for a man that doesn't seem to be effected, and only cares about money. Scorsese also decided to add comedy an autobiographical crime movie. Which works sometimes, but really this story shouldn't be one of comedy, we shouldn't laugh at the things that happen to the characters, and think its all just a big joke. In particular there is a scene where Jonah Hill and Leo's character decide to take Quaaludes. A form of drug. What insues is, again, and over the top scene where Jonah Hill is choking, and pretty much jeopardizing the well being of Jordan Belfort. I didn't even smirk, cause I didn't know this scene was supposed to be funny. What in the world? This scene was supposed to be comedic? I don't know what Scorsese was thinking when he made this movie, but it fall short. The movie did however have some quirky moments, and I will say it is entertaining to watch, and the acting is great from most of the cast, but this obsession with over the top moments, and unnecessary comedy parts makes this movie just decent. -6/10",neutral,6,tt0993846

"While I used to consider this movie to be my #1 pick, that has shifted to magnolia. The movie is still good, and I like it just as much as before. However after reading the book, it just seems flat.  Life is a series of comparisons, and while comparing this movie to other movies it's #1, but comparing this movie to other messages that I find through media, it's not, simply because the book's message is way better, with a lot more depth. Fight club was #1 in my book due to its original meaning but now that I found this meaning expanded upon in another medium, fight club has shrunk. There is just a lot more to it.  A lot.  I don't think the characters, especially Marla, are well developed.  Upon seeing the movie for the first time I had a feeling like Marla was supposed to be a big part of it, but she wasn't.  From the start he even says ""all this is because of marla"" or something like that.  But in fact, it wasn't really expanded upon at all.

It spoofs such movies as Point Break with its incredibly stupid lines, horribly horrible acting, and 3-minute racing scenes for what should take about 10 seconds. Paul Walker is the worst actor ever to have stumbled his way into the big-screen and that's what really made the movie work. Vin Diesel, a decent actor, chooses the comedy gem that brought him to mainstream humor venues and later got him into the less-funny XXX. I reccommend it for everyone with a sense of humor who can laugh at things like this. That said, this was complete sh*t. Zoolander, I believe, was the funniest movie of 2001 if I remember correctly, and this was the dumbest. Avoid unless you want something to laugh at for its stupidity. If you take it serious, 0/10.

"Fight Club opens my Top 25 movies. When it was in cinemas ( about November 1999 ) I did not see it, I thought that I would hate it. When I was in the states last year I saw it on video, and wanted to dislike it. But I just could not. Although I fall asleep about half way through the film, I thought it was really good. So I watched it again about one month later, when I was back in Germany, and loved it. I am a guy, and 17 years old, so I maybe am supposed to like this film, and it is very good. It might be a bit confusing. I think this is aside The Sixth Sense, Toy Story 2 and American Beauty, Blair Witch Project and American Pie the best movie of 1999. 1999 was a good year for film making, there were a lot of good/great movies, this is one of them. I do not like Brad Pitt that much, and even Edward Norton is not one of my favorite actors. But both of them did a good job in this flick. My favorite part of Fight Club was the scene where Brad Pitt explains the rules of Fight Club to the others. That was great. Good points about Fight Club : acting, directing, story, style, SOUNDTRACK, actors Bad points : also style ( sometimes it is just stupid ) All in all, I rated Fight Club 9.5/10 and recommend it to everyone between 10 and 35.

The animation was absolutely spectacular and you can tell the team took their time with each element to figure out realistic movements and actions/reactions to other elements and the world around them. That alone is worth a watch in my opinion. Maybe it's just because I'm older, but I feel like Pixar is usually a bit more kid focused with some throw-ins for adults, but this didn't feel like that. The racial undertones were a bit too on a nose for a kids movie, and what child is overly concerned with a love story being one of the central focuses of a movie. It was a very good message about being accepting to everyone and the desire to achieve one's hopes and dreams, but I feel like they could've gone about it differently. Also, I couldn't stand Wade.

"The Departed is directed by Martin Scorsese and written by William Monahan, Alan Mak and Felix Chong. It stars Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga, Anthony Anderson, Mark Rolston and Alec Baldwin. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Michael Ballhaus.

Martin Scorsese remakes Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs (2002) for the English speaking world, and promptly bagged his first Best Director Oscar in the process. It's a thrilling picture packed with suspense and edginess, a psychological gangster picture driven by two men leading double lives that is leading them to the abyss. When the violence comes it erupts in thunderous strokes, all while the narrative pulses with paranoia. There are some irksome contrivances, but with a uniformly strong set of turns from the cast, great musical accompaniments, and a director returning to gangster form, The Departed is a sure fire winner. 8.5/10",neutral,5,tt0407887
"This film is honestly flawless. The storytelling is amazing, the pacing is spot on, and the characters feel alive. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman bring so much depth and emotion to their roles.

"Fight Club might be the most interesting, unique, thought-provoking, entertaining, and perfect movie I've watched. Let me begin by getting some of the more physical strengths of the film out of the way: firstly, the cinematography is amazing. The movie looks great and looks like it could have been released in the 2010's despite being released in 1999. At the same time, there is an awesome 90s grunginess that just sucks the viewer in. I'd actually say cinematography is not far off Se7en, another excellent movie with Brad Pitt. The acting is amazing. Norton and Pitt completely own their roles, with Norton portraying a bit of a societal ""zombie"", stricken with insomnia, and working a meaningless, dead end 9-5 job, with material purchases as his way of coping and deluding himself that he is ""improving"" his life. Brad Pitt is the complete opposite, he preaches a free lifestyle, doing what he wants when he wants; confident, uncaring, not afraid of, or even looking forward to hitting rock bottom. The story is incredibly deep, riddled with many iconic quotes and themes. I would say this is a movie that many people will see differently, depending on their backgrounds, or even just depending on how they feel the day they watch the movie. As such, this movie has a very high rewatchability factor, and makes a great movie for discussion with friends. I urge anyone that has seen this movie to watch it multiple times, as you are bound to see it a bit differently each time. Watch it a month later, a year later, but watch it again! The story: without spoiling the movie, the story is excellent. Engaging, entertaining, moments of rage, insanity, disgust, tragedy, humour. I love that new things are constantly happening in the movie. Without having heard of the story before, it would be really hard to predict what will happen next. I think anyone that has felt like they have reached a new low in their life will connect with this movie. I remember watching it during a rough period in my life, and feeling empowered, feeling like I was able to make some kind of change in my life and the world around me, less afraid of just going for things. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0137523

"WOW... this movie is so good. One could never imagine a new director will do wonders to the first Batman movie he would direct. I remembered when i first saw the trailer, believe me my expectations were not high. But it's phenomenal pacing just won't let you blink. The score, plot, character, dialogue everything was interesting. Bale, Oldman, Freeman and Caine did amazing job with their role so does Cillian. Liam Neeson was as usual fantastic. The whole training scene is breathless and tumbler chase scene is edge of the seat stuff. All in all its a great, great movie. Although TDK is my favorite but this have a place of its own in my heart. This movie started it all. A solid 9.5/10 in my book and maybe the best superhero movie of all time.",neutral,5,tt0372784
"And he wasn't wrong. After recently viewing this masterpiece of American film for the first time it is understood why it has earned such acclaim for so many years. It is hard to put into the words how beautiful and flawless The Godfather really is, all I can say is that it is the most brilliant saga of family, business, and crime ever captured on camera. One of the greatest qualities about The Godfather is its craft. The craft is impeccable in this film. This must be credited to the fantastic cast (from Marlon Brando to Al Pacino to James Caan and even to Abe Vigoda) and to one of the greatest directors of American cinema: Francis Ford Coppola. No other man could have unraveled such a craftily built epic that The Godfather is and remains today. Coppola and co-screenwriter Mario Puzo (who wrote the novel The Godfather) wrote the greatest screenplay Hollywood has seen. And it is due to the genius of both of these two gentlemen that The Godfather came to be. Two scenes in the movie that prove the brilliance of this film are the fateful diner sequence and the fantastic ending. Micheal's emotion is so ever present in that scene it is like you are right there with him holding the gun, focused on killing the man that attempted the murder of his father. You are with Micheal. Brilliant Scene. I also love the ending in which the door closes on Kay who has just watched Clemenza kiss the hand of Don Michael Corleone, her husband. Best final scene I have ever witnessed. In final, I return to my opening remarks and Stanley Kubrick's quote, ""The Godfather is possibly the greatest movie ever made."" To me, this statement is amazing. This came from Kubrick...KUBRICK!...quite possibly the greatest filmmaker that ever lived. That just goes to show how powerful The Godfather is. I love this movie and all who love the art of film-making are in debt to the men and women who gave us this film. 10/10 If you haven't seen it, watch it. And if you have seen it, watch it again.",positive,10,tt0068646
"I finally decided to see this film after reading good reviews and noting that this film ranks in IMDB's top ten list (currently #2). At the very least I disovered where all the noble people are: they're in prison! The film is decent, but it certainly isn't what I would call great or extraordinary. There are good performances by Robbins and Freeman, but the pace of the movie is very slow and the cinematography is unremarkable. Characters are largely stereotypes, the story is somewhat formulaic (and sometimes ludicrous), and the noble prisoners vs wicked guards dichotomy is simplistic and unrealistic. I was also particularly annoyed at the narration, which always seemed to explain more than it needed to. As for the ending, I guess I was not as suprised as others since I did read the Stephen King novella many years ago. Still, given that the story takes place in a prison, you don't need to be a genius to guess part of it. This movie reminds me of Dead Poets Society in terms of its tone and theme of uplifting the human spirit against a backdrop of despair. If that's your thing, you'll love the movie. It's not really my thing. 5/10",neutral,5,tt0111161
"No words would do this movie justice...And I thought Batman Begins was great! It was-don't get me wrong...but when this one came to life, I think it put all other movies-including great Batman Begins-in its small pocket... Definitely the best movie of 2008 (so far;no one knows what the future holds), and definitely among the best movies of all time...Acting was superb..Christian Bale did an amazing job as the 'dark night'...the late Heath Ledger, the Joker, simply redefined the standards by which such roles would be judged...his performance was impeccable...Its among the very few movies that will make you root for the bad gay (to a certain extent). Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were excellent, as usual, in role and character...Gary Oldman was great too as Gordon...So was Aaron Eckhart and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, respectively... As I said, no words will do this movie justice...great acting aside, the plot was amazingly smart, interesting, thought-provoking, and most definitely, entertaining... A MUST WATCH to all...will keep you in awe and amazement for the entire 2 hours and 20 minutes..guaranteed!

Ledger's Joker remains the definitive take on the character, while Eckhart tries valiantly to keep up as Harvey Dent.

"Ho hum. In Peter Jackson's second movie of the three books, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) is trying to deliever the ring of power to the fire in middle earth, since that is where it was created, that is where it can be destroyed. Along with him is his friend Samwise (Sean Astin), who refers to his friend as ""Mr. Frodo"". Something about that strikes me as just weird. The other members of the broken fellowship (how did they break up? I don't remember, I saw the first one a year ago and I'm not an avid fan) seem to be trying to tag along. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), a human, Legolas (Orlando Bloom), an elf, and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), a dwarf, try to trace the trail of Frodo and Sam. Two more hobbits, Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan) get lost and are aided by talking and walking trees (!). Confused yet? The one-minute-shy-of-three-hours runtime seems somewhat padded, maybe so it can keep up its reputation. Jackson tried to stay faithful to the book, but kept too close. For the record, I have not read any of the books. If everything about Pippin and Merry had been taken out, it would have been easier to tolerate. To improve, they needed a more over-the-top climactic fight scene. In the first one it was the mines of Morea (sp?). This time it's Helm's Deep. With thousands of fighters, it's pure fun right? Wrong. It goes on for way too long, and after a while, it becomes, dare I say, boring? The first hour or so was fine, fun, and enjoyable. In the second hour, when characters came in and out and Jackson expected us to know everyone from the book, it drags a little. The third hour is just pure chaos, with not real rhyme to the reason. It also seemed like everyone who died came back to life. I know this is a magical world, but come on! After falling off a cliff? Gimme a break. All of the acting was fine (Astin's may have been best), but I still don't know who a lot of the characters were. Added to the mix is a computer animated character named Gollum, who sounds (and looks) a lot like Dobby from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. He was once a hobbit, but came under the spell of the ring, and he's dying to get his hands on it. So he helps out Frodo and Sam to get to where they need to go. Oh yeah, he also has split personality for a bit of comic relief. The cinematography seemed to either be long, wide, sweeping and beautiful shots or grotesque close-ups of Gollum or rotted faces of Orcs. Not exactly a pretty picture. The Two Towers doesn't have anything to do with the title (unless, of course, it was mentioned when I was in the bathroom). It's mainly a continuation of the first film, a transition between numbers one and three. And what was with Aragorn's dream type things? Maybe I should read the books. The Two Towers is entertaining but deeply flawed by its meaningless plot and boring fights. Its visuals are stunning, but little else in the movie is. My rating: 5/10 Rated PG-13 for epic battle sequences and scary images.",neutral,5,tt0167261
"It's not often I see a movie with so much talent that has so little going for it. I can't say that I went in expecting high quality for a movie released in January, but I really didn't believe that actors like Richard Gere, Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslett, Halle Berry, Emma Stone, et al, could all have elected to be in a film as mind-insultingly bad as this movie was. The problem wasn't that it was a sketch movie - there are sketch movies that are pretty good, see, e.g. Kentucky Fried Movie. The problem wasn't with the crudity, as there have been crude movies that aren't bad. The problem, really, is with the scale of the crassness and crudity. It's brazen, and not in a humorous way. The writing fails, the jokes fail, the acting fails (though Winslett does do well with what passes for the material she's given). The movie is rife with scatological and fellatious ""humor,"" which leaves you wondering why, exactly, you are sitting here watching this dreck. I found myself wondering if there was any redeeming piece to this movie, and, with the exception of Kate Winslett's efforts, and Terrence Howard as a 1950's basketball coach, which is why this movie gets 2/10 from me, there is nothing in this movie that really can be argued as quasi-quality.

"Sound - 1/2 - The score is bombastic, and the dialog is occasionally hard to hear.

The other characters are undeveloped and exist to represent specific ideas. Script/Writing - 0/2 - The script is a hodgepodge of corny tag lines and poorly executed themes. Visuals - 2/2 - The fate of humanity apparently rests on the colonization of bleak planets in bleak space, but at least there are cool wormholes, black holes, and baseball fields. Concept (Plot/Theme) - 1/2 - Interstellar deserves at least one point for ambition and creativity, but too many questionable plot developments are thrown together, and the film does not seem to commit to any of its ideas or themes, though some, such as time dilation, are certainly fascinating. When not confounded by possible paradoxes or superficial musings on love, one is left to question the viability of an anti-intellectual society portrayed with such unexplained cynicism, as well as the human imperative to survive on other planets when the species is apparently inclined to destroy its own natural habitat.

"In a world far, far away, a hobbit named Frodo got a mysterious ring that must be destroyed in order to stop the evil forces of Sauron. But the ring can only be destroyed in a volcano of Mordo. On his journey a wizard called Gandalf is assisting him... ""The lord of the rings"" trilogy is an event almost to big for me to swallow it. But you just have to give it credit: it's really rare to find such an ambitious example of fantasy films with special effects that last for 3 hours. And it's messages about the abuse and corruption of power. ------- The first film, ""The fellowship of the ring"", was a huge success: it was nominated for 4 Golden Globes and 13 Oscars, and on the site Rotten-Tomatoes.com it got an amazing critic's average grade of 8.1/10. Well, ""The fellowship"" really is a really good film, but after seeing it lately I couldn't hide my shock of how outdated it became in only a few years. That's mostly the fault of the terribly written dialogs, which look almost as if taken from some B film. The other problem is that the the story and it's characters lack a soul. They give an impression of a pale, mechanical puppet. Still, Peter Jackson is one talented director. Some scenes were pure genius ( like Arwen saving Frodo on a horse and creating a water army from the river that ""flushes"" away the bad guys ) and the set design is awesome ( cute hobbit houses ""digged"" in the ground ). That's why it's too bad that the whole film wasn't as good and warm as the magical soundtrack from Enya. All in all, I have to agree at some point with the brilliant director Peter Greenaway who commented on this film, calling it ""just a cynical exercise"". Grade: 6/10",negative,1,tt0120737

Of course i'm not going to spoil anything, and for those who have seen the movie you know what i'm talking about. But it's pretty hard, i mean i always feel a pressure of rating movies like this. Should i rate it high according to my opinion or because everyone else likes it and it's on most movie top list i check upon. These feelings mixtures a bit. If i've seen the movie before i check'd it out on IMDb i would never have guessed that it would be on the top 250. But it is and i can't complain i guess. But i decided now to give this movie an 8.

What saves this from being terrible is the acting isn't bad for this type of movie, and that is what saves this from being a total slog. Carrie Anne Moss makes a surprise appearance in this as a police detective and she saves the movie just when you might be ready to give up.

"This to me is THE definitive Batman film. Brooding and dark, Nolan gave Batman a revitalization it needed after WB/Schumacher's god- awful Batman & Robin. We get a darker and more serious toned Batman along with a fine performance from Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman. He's more fleshed out in this film more so than the previous incarnations of Batman on screen. Bale embodies everything I wanted in a Bruce Wayne. He's not wearing a mask when he's Batman, but he is when he's Bruce Wayne. Something that hasn't been really dived into, with the exception of Tim Burton's 1989 Batman, as it sort of was. Here we understand why Bruce Wayne is doing what he's doing and why he's out there putting himself on the line to beat criminals to a pulp with everything he knows. Batman Begins is also told in a nonlinear narrative. We get a series of flashbacks that develop Bruce's persona. We also get a Batman that fully utilizes his detective skills and his gadgets are very impressive. Almost real world like. Very little cgi in this film, almost everything is practical. Speaking of real world like, Nolan completely nails the tone of the film. It's grounded and works perfectly for a character like Batman. The supporting cast is excellent. Gary Oldman, Michael Cain, and Morgan Freeman are all spot on as Bruce Wayne/Batman's allies. Finally we have a Commissioner Gordon that is faithfully represented unlike the previous installments. Gordon does a lot more than just calling Batman for help, he actually dives into the action working Batman. Oldman is the perfect Gordon and it's very hard to imagine another actor in that role. Alfred is a lot more fleshed out as well, Michael Cain and Nolan bring more of a father figure role and is more than just a butler. Morgan Freeman provides the humor and levity of the film as Lucius Fox, who supplies Wayne's toys. I think out of all the villains in Nolan's almost perfect trilogy, the one who is overlooked is Liam Neeson's Ra's al Ghul. Nesson's portrayal is very underrated. He plays that mentor role to Bruce very well and he's not a typical evil villain, rather a villain who really believes that he's doing the right thing by destroying Gotham City as it's infested with crime. Something he and Bruce do not see eye to eye: killing. Cillian Murphy is awesome as Dr. Crane otherwise known as Scarecrow. Every moment with the Scarecrow is gold and it's a shame he's nothing more than just as ""pawn,"" as Batman puts it. Tom Wilkinson also has a sharp supporting role as Carmine Falcone a powerful mob boss and I even enjoyed Mark Boone Junior as Gordon's corrupt partner Detective Flass. The action scenes involving the Batman's vehicle the tumbler is exciting, but I cannot say the same for the hand to hand fight sequences. Batman's extraordinary martial arts are exploited as well as they could be. There's too much shaky cam and you can't tell who or what is happening. I felt only small amounts of chemistry between Katie Holmes and Christian Bale. I liked some of Holmes's performance, but like Kirsten Dunst in Sam Raimi's original Spider-Man film, where Holmes's character Rachel declares her love for Bruce, it's very awkward and kinda bland. Almost uncomfortable to watch. With a strong lead, and a supporting cast, solid script by David S. Goyer, and under the direction of Christopher Nolan, this is the Batman film I've been waiting for. 9.6/10",neutral,6,tt0372784

"Batman Begins (2005) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows Bruce Wayne in a state of self pity and looking for himself. He travels around the world learning various forms of martial arts, including from a master known as Ra's Al Ghul. When he discovers Ra's Al Ghul is the leader of a crime syndicate he believes he killed him and retreats home. Once home he's inspired to save the city and creates the vigilante known as Batman. As Batman starts trying to clean up the city he discovers Ra's Al Ghul isn't as dead as he thought. This movie is director by Christopher Nolan (Tenet) and stars Christian Bale (American Psycho),
Michael Caine (The Swarm), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Gary Oldman (True Romance), Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later), Katie Holmes (Disturbing Behaviors), Liam Neeson (Taken), Morgan Freeman (Se7en) and Rutger Hauer (Hobo with a Shotgun). There's so much to like about this movie. The casting is outstanding, especially Caine and Morgan Freeman. They play outstanding and very entertaining supporting roles. Bale was a very solid Batman. The storyline starts off well with fantastic training scenes and developing an understanding of why Batman's fighting capabilities are so good. Murphy's character was so good and I loved seeing Scarecrow in a Batman live action movie. The action scenes were very good and the Batmobile was outstanding. Nolan did a remarkable job both with the cinematography and the dramatic soundtrack. This was a tremendous way to kick-off Nolan's magnificent Batman trilogy.

"First of all, I am very disappointed that this movie currently stands as no.1 of all time on IMDb listing. People, just remember the first time you watched the Matrix, Godfather, Braveheart, any Stanley Kubrick movie, and the list goes on. I think IMDb should take this matter seriously and reconsider its rating system, because I have been using this website for god knows how long as a reliable way to select movies to watch and compare my taste. Let me tell you that I actually went to see this movie a second time to really make up my mind. Now, why such a low rating, why soo serious?? Well, first of all, I am a big fan of Batman and a big fan of Christian Bale, but, unfortunately, I have to say this was his worst acting role. I think the direction or production forgot about the Batman for this movie, there is no darkness in his character, no depth, no inner struggle, I mean Christian Bale himself looks bored. The comments of Alfred on the other hand, as his ""adviser"" are just useless, a poor performance from another great actor. I don't want to continue criticizing the actors, but it doesn't get any better as I think of the other actors. Heath Ledger may have pulled off a very good performance though, he was very good, but I mean we saw him maybe 30 minutes in the movie, and some parts were too predictable. OK, so, what makes this movie so disappointing? It is no longer a comic movie and we have to many ""real"" elements. A vigilante wearing a mask and using his wealth to have amazing gadgets, fighting against a psycho, who's motives we don't even really find out, what made him the way he is: a self proclaimed ""agent of chaos"". We also have a harvey dent, who has the highest morals and who is incorruptible, or maybe not. The story is too long, the innovative schemes that Batman comes up with to stop the Joker are over the top and simply too unrealistic. In order to achieve making the Joker look super intelligent and a mastermind, all the direction does is make sure the rest of the characters are very stupid. I mean, leaving him uncuffed??? Come on? OK, so, do the action scenes and special effects save the day? NOPE! Remember the chase scene in Ronin? Remember the robbery scene in Heat? Not comparable. I'm sorry, but everything in this movie is sub par! This is a mediocre high budget flick, with nothing genuine to offer. A cheap ripoff and attempt to reintroduce the story of Batman without any twists. How is it that the movie lasts almost 3 hours if not more, and there is no story development what so ever. Oh wait sorry, by the end of the movie, Batman becomes the bad guy, yeah okay... I can go on and on but I am just starting to lose my calm. Hollywood, wake up, World wake up, if you think this was a good movie, then, I suggest you watch idiocracy, and maybe you will recognize it as a true vision of the future.

"I'm not a big fan of epic war movies. I didn't like LOTR trilogy as much as most people did. I just don't feel invested in such stories. But I found Gladiator way more engrossing and gripping than any movie in the LOTR franchise. It's masterfully directed, edited, and acted. It's beautifully shot. It has a fantastic score. It's very entertaining, and fast paced, Ridley Scott didn't waste any time, and I watched the extended version! It has very complex and compelling characters. And above all that, it has heart. This movie has a very moving and touching story, and that really surprised me. Russell Crowe gave an iconic performance as Maximus, and Joaquin Phoenix delivered a magnetic over-the-top performance as the villain, Commodus. This is a hammy performance that doesn't only fits the film's Shakespearean tale, but it also can easily be justified by the character's motives and persona.

The animation is fantastic, sophisticated, colourful, and it contributes to create spectacular action sequences.It has its own distincive style.
In terms of rhythm moves fast, it doesn´t drag and is very fun.
There weren´t really any negative aspects, just minnor things, there was one character here, that i wish it could have been more explored, and a villain that was just decent.
Spider Man Into the Spider-Verse its a creative, exciting, funny, profound and visually stunning movie. The best Spider-Man movie to date, and one of the best super-hero movies this past years. 8.4/10",negative,4,tt4633694
"""Home Alone"" is already a New Year's classic. I am writing a review a few hours before the New Year 2024, the time is more suitable than ever! The film is a comedy, the action takes place, as it is clear, on Christmas Eve, the idea is quite original, the actors also did their job well. I also want to say that I am not an ardent fan of this movie and do not watch it every New Year, but it is worth recognizing the cult significance and overall interest of the plot of ""Home Alone"". I would recommend watching this movie at least once in a New Year's mood to feel the rush of the atmosphere. It's worth it! My rating : 7.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0099785
"Let me first say that Batman has long been one of my favorite of the comic heroes. Let me also say that Tim Burton is the most worthless director with a morbid sense of reality and fantasy. With that being said the first Batman, though it had its weak points, was pretty good coming from a director I absolutely can't stand. The saving point of the first film was the casting of Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. These two actors made the film hands down. From the second film on, the Batman creations up to this point have been absolutely lousy with no possibility for redemption. Now, I have read many of the posted reviews for this film and I am shocked that so many thought so highly of it. I hear many speak of how disappointing theater films have been over the recent years, yet move to speak with top marks about this production. I suppose that when you are starved long enough, even moldy bread tastes good. This is unfortunate, because though it was a fair film, it wasn't great. In my opinion the film took too long developing the Batman character. Over half of the film was spent doing this. Then once we finally get to see Batman in costume and in action, the shots are so quick and dark, that you really don't see Batman at all. Instead you just see a flurry of people getting jerked, pushed and thrown about in a quick frenzied sequence. Further, I was to the understanding that this film would be directed more for adults versus children. If that is true, then why was it necessary to add Kung Fu/Karate/Samurai training school theatrics to the film? I believe this was the true cheese of the film, and it was taken much too far. As well, the plot and story were only fair. Folks, as a kid and up through my teen years I have read many comics. The stories in those comics were much more creative and imaginative than what I found to be illustrated here. I would like to further state that the casting for characters could have been better than it was. Without spoiling other opinions, I will just say that some of the cast was really good, and some were really bad. As for Liam Neeson, well I felt like I was watching Obi Wan again, only a little darker. It is my personal note to say that I am saddened by the lack of creativity in Hollywood these days. In all genres, I find myself disappointed on every level with the productions over the recent years. I continue to wonder when a production will be released that will actually captivate me, and keep me begging for more. I just haven't seen it recently. Further, originality has left the building and it doesn't look like it's coming back any time soon. I say this for all films of recent and this film was no exception. At best, I rate ""Batman Begins"" with a 5/10. For all those who believe ""Batman Begins"" to be a blockbuster, well I'm just curious as to what mentality is responsible for such high opinions.",neutral,5,tt0372784
"The animated feature film Coco may have a sad coming of age storyline but the way it is excuted is so poorly done, to begin with there is quite litterally one of those scenes where the villian is confronted infront of everyone but it just comes off with no... anything at all its just very poorly executed. One thing that should be given to the film is how well rounded the amount of respect and knowledge it has on Mexican culture, even down to the ""chancla"". Everything about the film feels authentic and almost like a love letter to mexican culture. Now of course since it is a pixar film the animation is going to be stellar. Final verdict:

"Rating: 10/10 ""The Shawshank Redemption"" isn't just a movie; it's an experience that reshapes your perspective on hope and redemption. Watching it feels like meeting an old friend who, despite life's rough edges, offers a profound sense of comfort and understanding. Tim Robbins delivers a hauntingly nuanced performance as Andy Dufresne, a banker wrongfully convicted of murder. His portrayal of resilience and intellect against the bleak backdrop of Shawshank State Penitentiary is both mesmerizing and deeply human. Morgan Freeman, as Ellis ""Red"" Redding, is nothing short of extraordinary. His voiceover serves as a poetic guide through the film's emotional landscape, drawing us closer to the characters and their intertwined fates. What stands out is the film's ability to weave together threads of friendship, justice, and the human spirit with such elegance. The cinematography and score, while understated, enhance the narrative, crafting a world that's as oppressive as it is hopeful. Despite its initial box office struggles, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has grown into a timeless classic. It's a film that speaks to the core of what it means to endure and dream, and it's one that I find myself coming back to time and time again. If you haven't seen it, prepare for a journey that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",positive,10,tt0111161
"Imagine ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" retold as a 1950's beach-blanket flick (hot sports cars, bikini babes, parents unaware of their out-of-control, freewheeling children) and you have ""Catch Me if You Can,"" another Spielberg flick that's in love with its own imagined sense of importance.  Not that it isn't entertaining, it is quite entertaining, but once the effects of this sugarcoated, high-gloss 'true story' wear off, it makes you wonder why we should really care about some kid who ran around the globe forging checks and seducing girls with low self-esteem to get ahead in his extortion scams. Tom Hanks shows up once again (*yawn*) with his typical 'martyr of purity' shtick; I would've preferred less of him and more of Christopher Walken's impassioned (and far more brief) performance as a long-suffering father. 6/10",neutral,6,tt0264464
"""The Godfather"" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone. Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it. The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening. But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace. The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings. In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions. It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing. It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that. Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century. 10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",positive,10,tt0068646

"Frodo and Sam encounter Gollum, whilst Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli go to Rohan. This is the very cinematic middle part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. From the opening flyover shots of the snowy mountain peaks, 'The Two Towers' is fantastic to look at and full of perilous adventure. As with the first movie, if you have read the book, it will likely influence your enjoyment as it puts a lot more focus on the non-Hobbit characters and turns the source material into a Hollywoodised action adventure. The script moves the established characters along their journey, introduces more characters and stages some very spectacular events. To do this it splits into a number of directions as it follows different groups through various paths and obstacles. Some scenes put the foundations in place for what is to come in the next movie, whilst most of it leads towards the centre piece of this movie, the Battle of Helms Deep. This unfolds at a relatively uneven pace, but all scenes are technically well made. If you compare the battle to the various spectacles of the modern era such as those in Game of Thrones it feels pretty standard, but at the time of its release it was groundbreaking in terms of the scale of the set-piece and use of CGI. A huge theme in the trilogy is hope in the face of despair and the battle portrays it with some wonderful sequences. The arrival of the elves, King Theoden riding out to meet the Orcs, and THAT moment when sun rises still makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Is there too much CGI? Yes, I think there is. As epic as it makes the battle look, it is distracting when you know most of those vast Orcs legions were generated by computer programmers. That being said, a major success of the movie is it's CGI depiction of the character Gollum by the animators and the work of performance-capture star Andy Serkis. This character is central to the depiction of how the ring corrupts the souls of those who possess or seek to possess it and his scenes are some of the best in the trilogy. Generally the visuals are phenomenally good. The cinematography, lighting, colours, editing, locations, set design, costuming, makeup, props, and general art design are some of the most iconic in movie history. For me the visual spectacle is so powerful it actually detracts my attention from the characters, who are good, but sometimes feel they have come along for the ride. It is a movie that could have been perfect if the characters were better and there were performances that (aside from Serkis) were truly iconic. Saying that there are lots of solid performances, with the best for me being Bernard Hill, Brad Douriff, Ian McKellen, Sean Astin, and David Wenham. Nobody feels less than adequate for the role. However, I get the feeling that the focus was so much on the animation and the general look and feel that Peter Jackson might have been satisfied with not capturing that many truly memorable character moments. For me it's an 8.5/10 but I round upwards.",neutral,5,tt0167261
"I voted this movie be 1/10 stars on this website, which is way to much for a movie like this. I didn't like the atmosphere in the film at all. Beating each other without any reasonable reason. Besides that there were lots of blasphemic things in this movie in combination with very violent language. I think filmmakers show that they are incompetent by using a script that contains lots of violent words. Why... would you might think right now. Almost all real good movies like Gladator, The Green Mile, Lord of the Rings and The Shawshank Redemption show us that you create atmosphere by good acting and story telling...therefore you don't need actors to use blasphemic language all the time. This movie was bought by a friend of mine and we watched it at his home.

The idea is original, but the constant camera point of view with so many jumps and bumps and shakes and movement becomes sickening really fast.

"I didn't like how they twisted God's Word into a serial killer machine - they will stand before a real God someday for this film. Fear motivates people and could have brought about the changes that all the characters wanted to see take place. That would have been an interesting movie--people dedicated to maintaining order realizing that the order needs to be subverted to do actual good. That is an interesting conflict. Could the divorce really happen? The groundwork was there for such action to take place, but the result would have been too thought-provoking to be thrilling for the average viewer. Fear shapes people's behavior more than anything else, when present. Think about how many churches you see on your way to work. Inertia takes over when fear is absent.

"OK, where must I begin. I might as well point out the bad things first in respect to the game. Now, what the hell was with the whole 24th chromosome thing? Makes sense to me, yes. However, what the hell happened to, well, HELL? These monsters in the movie were respectable enough to relate to the imps and hell knights in the game, but WHERE THE HELL ARE THE FIRE AND PLAMSA BALLS?! Where are the flying lost souls? Where are the CACODEMONS? where's the F**kin demon lord and spider demon for crying out loud. Maybe I'm being a little vain and asking for too much, but the monsters in the game were different breeds, and all came from hell, not mutated. The whole plot was actually somewhat too similar to Resident Evil. It p*s*e* me off. They completely abandoned all that the game was based on plot wise. Now, as for the characters, I'm glad that they made it a team effort in this, and the characters were funny at times, but they seemed so underdone, except for of course, Reaper and Sarge, even Rosamund Pike couldn't add to anything in the film. I know I'm being picky, but blood and guts game? One man fighting to stop hell (or team effort)? Hello? The good things were that they stayed on Mars, they had the BFG in it, but it was so underused. I think the highlight of it was the first person thing, which I feel quite gypped on because of the short amount of time that we see it. I feel like they just put it in there for the game fans so they'd have their glory, and I am a die hard doom fan, but i feel somewhat insulted by it. They have had plenty of technology available to them to make this so much better, but they didn't use what they could've had available to them. Maybe if ID worked with them on it, it wouldn't have been such a disappointment, but this was just insulting to us gamers once again. however, a SMALL improvement when it comes to other VG movies.

"I just watched Fight Club (which was ashamedly the first time I had done so), and I must say I was thoroughly underwhelmed. This could be a problem with the hype around it meaning my expectations were set really high, but at the same time I never see the hype around many David Fincher productions. This film is similar to David Fincher's other critical success - se7en. Both films are beautifully shot, Fincher's cinematography is characteristically dark but captivating and beautiful. However Fight Club, much like se7en, fails to capture me in its narrative. The message of this film is that consumerism is making everyone a slave to society, suppressing every man's inner urges and masculinity, so people should be allowed to express their inner primal urges (but not let it entirely consume you). This is well discussed in films, and not new, but to the film's credit it deals with it in an imaginative - but not subtle - way. Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter are great, but I failed to get invested in any of them to be honest. A well shot and imaginative yet underwhelming film. 7/10.",positive,7,tt0137523

"I strongly feel unjust for Leonardo DiCaprio for leaving the 86th Academy Awards ceremony empty handed once again. This year, he was nominated for ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"" in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street. Based on the memoirs of a stockbroker swindler, Jordan Belford (played by Leo), this movie captures the gist of the nefariousness of humankind – greed, lust and pride. Watching the movie was like being on a roller coaster ride, it started off with a good pace, characteristic traits slowly being built up but still being fueled by energy and adrenaline (more like being fueled by drugs and booze). However, it might have been three hours too long for a movie that portrays the vicious cycle of things. Apart from sharing the same theme (and the similar level of shallowness), both The Wolf of Wall Street and The Hangover were in the Top 10 movies by the American Film Institue(AFI) Awards in 2013 and 2009 respectively. Despite having the strong belief in how it is these movies about drugs and drinks that have set a bad benchmark for the social norm, I feel that it is still a privilege for our generation to have a few light comedies for us to laugh and talk about for a period of time; and The Wolf of Wall Street fulfills this role perfectly. A glimpse of how the rich and famous live their lives- using Franklins for paper toss and snorting cocaine, literally throwing money at people; the 3 hours for when I was watching the movie actually made me lose track of the value of money. What was running through my mind at the point of time? -""How I wish I could afford to act like them."" As much as the scriptwriter did a good job of dramatizing the story, showing the audience what we would want to see in an Oscar-worthy nominee, it is sad to say that there are still certain parts of the movie that holds true in today's society. The hedgies who work on Wall Street themselves might say that the ""Wolf"" is just a mythical reflection on reality and that they are actually stressed and depressed and losing more hair than ever everyday. But hey, who is there to say that these very same people who are earning at least 6 figures per year do not squander money like napkins? Ultimately, this is just another film for entertainment purposes. Being a rated-R movie, people whom this film is targeted at should be able to differentiate which parts of the movie are dramatized, which parts of the movie that are for laughs and most importantly, what is the learning point from each movie. Even horror movies have their takeaways too- never open a diary if it looks like something that is related to witchcraft. And for me, one of the most vital learning points that I got from this was to never forget where you began, especially when you're at the top of the ladder. Based on the fact that it is an awesome comedy (and the fact that the lead male is Leo), I would give it 8.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0993846

"A word to the Olympics: If you ever run out of clay pigeons to use in the shooting events, use copies of this monstrosity instead. Another dreadful spoof from Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, this parodies 300 and other blockbuster movies. Friedberg and Seltzer are an enigma in movies. How do they find work? No-one likes them. Some like Michael Bay or Twilight, but no-one likes these horrendous spoofs. Meet the Spartans is no different. The next time Jack Bauer wants to torture someone, he should just show them scenes from this movie. A film so ludicrously bad that you chuckle throughout, partially out of disbelief at how bad it is and partially because you just feel sorry for Friedberg and Seltzer because of how bad they are, MTS may not be quite as awful as Disaster Movie thanks to a grand total of 2 decent jokes, but it is undeniably an atrocious cinematic work. The film is so thin that it's only 65 minutes long. To get this to feature length, the end credits are really long and extended with deleted scenes. It's bad. I'm running out of ways to emphasize that now. The jokes are appalling. They're overdone, desperate, often sexist, weird, juvenile and just not funny. If you do laugh, you laugh at it not with it. The direction is also painfully awful, and this is as artistic as a muddy rainwater puddle thanks to the directors' total lack of effort. The acting is expectedly terrible, and the film suffers in general from its lack of wit, intelligence, structure and anything to make it feel like an actual movie, rather than some cruel form of cinematic torture. It's difficult to pick out the worst joke, although the tedious, face palm inducing sequence of celebrities getting kicked into the pit of death, a silly slow motion battle scene and a GTA scene which just doesn't make any sense stick in the memory. The ending is not remotely satisfying and this is not just a terrible film, it's one with a sexist, obnoxious personality and something which seems to be out to ridicule the films we like in an offensive manner.

The answer is a resounding yes, according to me. Though it failed miserably at the time of release it is now heralded as one of the greatest of the greatest that the medium of cinema has ever seen. It is #1 on the imdb Top 250. It is an impressive, engrossing filmmaking masterpiece adapted from the horror prodigy Stephen King's 1982 novella 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'. With Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as its main characters, the movie offers marvelous acting although Robbins' Andy Dufresne scores low with respect to his overall energy I feel. It almost seems artificial, bland and repetitive. Serving a life sentence for murder, Red (Morgan Freeman) is a blend of cynicism and sincerity - a man with a good soul who has done a vile deed in his past. His friendship with Andy is the film's main highlight. The inspirational, life-affirming and uplifting, old-fashioned style (the music and some of the cinematography) Hollywood production (Castle Rock Entertainment) is a combination of a prison-drama film as well as excellent character study. The film takes the-innocent-man-in-prison theme and gives it a new angle. Instead of focusing on crusades for freedom, the film ventures down a less-travelled road, concentrating on the personal cost of adapting to prison life and how some convicts, once they conform, lose the ability to survive beyond the barbed wire and iron bars of the prison cell. As one of the character puts it : ""These walls are funny. First, you hate them, then you get used to them, then you start to depend on them."" This is the case with Brooks (excellently portrayed by James Whitmore) who is completely institutionalized and the scenes with him attempting to cope with life outside of prison represents one of the film's most moving and effective sequences. The chiaroscuro of the entire film is incredible and of the scenes which leaves an impression on one's mind is one when Andy, after escaping from the prison, expresses his joy and freedom by looking up at the dark sky and his upward-facing hands welcoming raindrops to fall over his body. Darabont's film is a patiently-told, allegorical tale (unfolding like a long-played, sometimes painstakingly long chess game) of friendship, hope, survival, emancipation and ultimate redemption and salvation by the time of the film's finale. However, on the downside, following a solid two hours of thought-provoking drama, the film deflates like a punctured balloon during its overlong denouement. The all-too-predictable final twenty two minutes move a little slowly and my heart goes out to Darabont who displays a distressing need to wrap up everything into a tidy little package. All in all, the film is undoubtedly great and only time will tell if it holds up another 25 or so years down the line. It's already been 24 years but I hope the future generations enjoy it just as much and not be put off by the pace and style of the narrative. 9/10.",neutral,5,tt0111161
"much has been said about how great this film is,and i hesitated for the longest time before breaking down,but finally i bought the Restoration Box set which contains the three films and two bonus discs.so,after watching this first film,i must say i was pretty impressed.it's a well crafted film.at a running time of just over one hundred and seventy three minutes,you'd never know it.there never a dull moment.it's exceptionally engrossing from the opening frame to the closing credits.the acting is superb.Marlon Brandon is excellent,but i would say that a young Al Pacino matches him.the dialogue is also well written.for me,The Godfather is a 10/10",positive,10,tt0068646

"In David Fincher's controversial and outstanding Fight Club, Edward Norton plays a person whose name we never find out. He has no life: he has a dead-end job, he orders IKEA furniture mail-order, and he becomes addicted to self-help groups. But Marla Singer (Helena Bohnam Carter) also goes to his groups, and the Narrator's condo gets burned down. And then he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Tyler sells soap. And so the Narrator moves in with Tyler, and they soon find out that they have masochistic pleasures and start a ""Fight Club"". Every Saturday night people can pummel each other for fun. And the Narrator's life turns topsy-turvey. Lotsa fights, action scenes, dark humor, and awesome acting. Norton was exceptional as the Narrator. He really brought out the dullness of the character he was trying to show. Great job. Pitt was good but nothing to write home about. He did manage to tell us that he does have some acting talent, but wouldn't be half as famous if he was ugly. Carter really displayed some strong acting here. The supporting cast, including Meat Loaf and Jared Leto, has strong potential (yes, even Meat Loaf!). There was, in the superbly written script, a lot of dark humor. The early scenes, such as the Narrator and Marla arguing over which groups to attend, had a lot of the humor. The script, which enjoys to have great speeches by Pitt, was so well written. The over narration (which dominates most of the film) was excellent. I can't really describe it, there are no words. The movie works best when it's at its trippiest. The ending twist (which I unfourtanatly read about before) went out in more directions that I had thought. If there is one major flaw, it is that Fight Club doesn't really have a real plot. The opening part of the film is about the Narrator's life. The second part is the Fight Club. The third part is the scheme that Tyler has to branch off from Fight Club. And the final part is the ending. The excessive violence, in my opinion, was necessary to the movie and I wouldn't have cut anything out. Fight Club is an extremly entertaining movie with great acting and stunning visuals. My rating: 8/10 Rated R for strong violence, language, terrorist acts, and some sexuality.",positive,8,tt0137523
"The Godfather is more than a crime movie; it's a profound exploration of power, loyalty, and moral decay within the top or influential families. It reflects the dark side of the old American Dream, revealing how ambition and survival can blur the line between business and crime. Through the Corleone family, the film exposes the contradictions of power and the need to protect one's family while destroying others to maintain influence. While the storytelling is amazing, some scenes feel a bit too stretched. Some of the acting also lean toward theatrical performances at times, creating a sense of stage-like intensity rather than natural realism. Overall, I believe it's a 7/10 based on the plot, acting, and more. It's not a 100% perfect work but at the same time, not bad, or average.",positive,7,tt0068646
"The first thing I want to say is that the film was far better than I expected. The fighting scenes were good, the acting too, and the special effects were just amazing... I was really impressed how the film showed the ancient Rome , a great work of the special effect crew. But the story was just the same old thing. Bad man cheats good man and becomes king (in this case: emperor) , and good man fights for justice against the bad man although he's inferior. Well, you can also find that in Shakespeare's pieces, so this is certainly nothing new. And because the characters were all in all clichees, this is not shown very good either. Another point: the film is, historically seen, not correct: Rome never became a republic again, and Commodus reigned until 191 AD. And he was certainly not killed in the arena... The last point: Maximus is quite a stupid name, it just means ""the greatest"", and romans didn't name their children like that... well, these are all just unimportant details... 6/10",neutral,6,tt0172495
"I've really enjoyed Christopher Nolan's reinvention of Batman. I recently saw Batman Begins and I thought it was the best Batman movie of the series.The origin story was handled very well for such a loved comic book superhero. And now, Batman is back! The Dark Knight centres around Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale), Lieutenant Gordon (Gary Oldman)and new District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) trying to track down the crazed and murderous psychopath, The Joker (Heath Ledger) and stop him from causing chaos and havoc in Gotham City. The Dark Knight is not only one of the best movies of 2008 so far, it very well might be the best superhero movie yet. The performances in the film are terrific and serve the story well. The best actor has to be Heath Ledger as The Joker. In my opinion, he's the best actor to have portrayed and capture the philosophy of the character. He's really put his stamp on it and made it his own. It's horrible that he didn't live to see what a fantastic job he's done. He deserves an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. After seeing The Dark Knight, I can't wait for the next Batman movie, that's how great this film is! 9/10",positive,9,tt0468569
"Plan 9 is probably the best example of a movie that became a classic because it's so bad! This is why: 1. The effects are horrendous,look at the UFO's,you can see the strings that are holding them.The mothership is funny as ever and the way that the UFO's move is even more funny.They swing around like a bad thrown frisbee and the shots of the UFO's seen over Hollywood is just horrifying,not to mention the scene in which the army tries to shoot down the UFO's,these are just archive footages. 2. The dialogues are the worst ever with highlights:""It's murder and someone is responsible"",""Visits? but that would indicate visitors!"" and the hilarious ""pillow"" dialogue between the young pilot and his wife.And what about the legendary ""Solarbanite"" or how do you spell it? 3. The voice-over(Crisswell) during the movie is very irritating and his dialogue is spoken in the worst way. 4. The scenes with Horror legend Bela Lugosi are few in numbers because he died in the early period of shooting,but the answer but his death is as funny as legendary:He is replaced by a so called double who doesn't look like him so he covers his face with a cape,hilarious!! 5. The acting is horrifying as well as hilarious!! The scene in which the aliens(normal humans!) meet their master is funny because of the way they greet each other.The tirade by the alien woman is bad,but the way that Eros(male alien) throws her away is even worse! 6. The film is pretty anti-woman. 7. The directing and shooting by Ed Wood is worse than worse! Overall,Plan 9 from outer space is probably the worst movie ever,but because it is so bad it makes it hilarious and,even better(or worse),an all-time classic.I can't give it a high grade but I can't give it a low grade either,so I chose a grade in the middle. I taped it and I don't want to lose it ever again! A definite must-see!?!  5.5/10",neutral,5,tt0052077
"I don't understand how this movie managed to get to Number one on this site. While it's a good movie with talented actors, it's just not as entertaining and solid as other movies that i believe deserve the top ranking. I enjoyed watching it, and it really doesn't deserve the 1/10 rating I've given it (thats only to bring it lower on the top 250) it just isn't as good as other movies I have seen and loved such as 'Trainspotting', 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Donnie Darko' for example.

"Man I'm shocked to like this movie as much as I did. I never would have guessed it would have been one of my favourites of 2018. I expected the usual standard Superhero CGI Animated movie, but looking at the credits now and noticing people behind The Lego Movie wrote and produced it, it all started to make sense. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse could very well be the best Spider-Man movie ever! The animation was very stylish with mix of CGI and Comic-Book style art. This is a movie that did not take itself seriously at all, and with many different universes of Spider-Men it just went crazy and gave us a real packed 2 hours of entertainment. The use of music was decent, there was alot of heart to it, surprises, good gags, and it all felt fresh and interesting to the series. Overall, a real standout for Sony Pictures Animation and a very high bar set for Animated Superhero movies, giving other Animated movies a run for their money. 8.5/10",neutral,5,tt4633694

"(Karthik Narayan) Before we start, note the spelling  its M-E-M-E-N-T-O and not MOMENTO, as I had thought! Now let's start this movie review: Imagine having a jigsaw puzzle in hand, and you don't have a clue what completes it. You don't have all the pieces required to finish it. There is no picture in your mind, and you are left to search for your answers. What do you do? To what sounds like a treasure hunt and a jigsaw puzzle combined, add a strong flavor of revenge and you get a masterly movie all set before your home screens! All you need to do is get the DVD and watch it. Maybe over and over again, like I have been doing The movie begins with the end and the end marks the beginning of the story (did I say that right?). Yes, that is how this movie unravels itself. The plot thickens as you move backwards (pun intended) and when all the pieces are slowly knitted together, the beginning (or is it the ending) is quite beautiful. The alternating between the Black/White and the color every ten minutes or so makes it all the more compelling to watch. And how do you watch this movie? Ideally it should be shown from back to front to understand. This isn't a murder mystery movie  its more of a thriller that takes so many twists and turns as you move towards the beginning (Oh no, not again. Somebody stop me) that you never get enough of watching it once. The movie doesn't end telling you what to make of it. You have to draw your own conclusions and decipher your own riddles. When the movie brilliantly closes with the credits, it leaves you wondering about reality and what you had been watching all along. As you still can't get over Guy Pearce's (the protagonist, Leonard) handsome looks, also note that he has a blank look on his face most of the time. That says it all  he looks helpless. You don't know how to react to his confused state of mind  you get stuck between 3 things  whether to slap him and bring him to shape; or feel pity for him hoping he would recover. The other thing that keeps us interested is how to crack the case. How would he find revenge, and how would he remember it? All confusions and the ""don't trust anybody"" funda psychologically affects us as well as we are left with no choice but to not trust what we see and hear of other characters. Christopher Nolan has directed the movie excellently, with an adapted screenplay based on the short story by Jonathan Nolan (are they related?), that keeps us all on the edge of our seats. This movie carries more mystery and as each piece falls in place. But the first half of the movie makes no sense at all; you really get things moving along only after the removal of the tattoos on Guy's body. Overall, this is not a movie which you will appreciate if you want to watch a fun movie. It needs your attention and you get engrossed in the thick of action. There are some scenes which could have been done away with, for example, the hotel scene where Pearce calls for an escort, but it all adds up to the confusion, so I am not to complain. Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie still carries her looks of Matrix, and though there isn't a meaty role in the movie for her, so she does well. Joe Pantoliano as Teddy steals most of the scenes with his corny jokes and at one point of time, you can't help loving his casual approach to the whole thing. The acting is brilliant, the settings and camera work are good. The music by David Julyan is racy and keeps the pulse ticking faster with every scene. I'm sure I would be hearing a lot of and from him. Simply for creativity and keeping the adrenaline and brain cells ticking all the time, this movie deserves great accolades. This is an all time classic that I would recommend to test your thought process. If I were to put up an all time list of best movies, this would definitely find its place in the top 25. Rating  8.5/10. As for the book, if you ever get hold of it, keep me informed!",neutral,5,tt0209144
"IMDb Top 250: 23 The Matrix is an unreasonably awesome movie. The stunts, the effects, the black suits and shades- The Matrix is dripping awesomeness. But unlike many other action and sci-fi movies, The Matrix has brains. The plot of The Matrix is like Terminator for the internet generation. Man created machine, machine rebelled, machine won. Human survivors fight machines in a constantly dark, post-apocalyptic world. But the machines created the matrix, a giant computer program where the farmed humans' minds live their 'lives'. It's complicated, but it all makes sense. The Matrix's plot demands brain and eye attention. The actors are perfectly chosen. Keanu Reeves in a role where he's supposed to be quiet and badass? Perfect! He was made to be Neo. Laurence Fishborne aces the wise leader, and he busts his chops during the interrogation. Hugo Weaving is really the show stealer though: his Agent is so menacing, and when he opens up to Morpheus, it's very tense. This is an action movie, and boy is there action. The martial arts scenes are so incredible, and the insanity allowed because of the setting makes them even better. Running air kicks? Punches that break walls? It's all cool in the matrix. And the gunfights: the iconic lobby shootout, and the even more iconic bullettime gives The Matrix identity in a sea of sci-fi. The action is boosted by the success of the effects. Agent bullet dodging, the explosions, the rippling bullets, your jaw will drop. The ""fluff effect"" in the lobby is so cool too. It made me wonder why this has never been seen in 3D. Also, the CGI machines are terrifying and realistic. You should see The Matrix, benchmark of sci-fi films for the past decade. Matching brawn with brain, you really can't miss this modern classic. 9.4/10",negative,4,tt0133093

"What I truly loved is how the film takes its time to develop the story. It doesn't rush; instead, it unfolds slowly and deliberately, pulling you deeper into the world of the Corleone family.

A timeless classic that deserves every bit of its praise.",positive,10,tt0068646
"Summer 2017 as a bolt from the clear sky in the network broke the news about the dismissal of directors, then still an unnamed film about Khan Solo. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were known to a wide audience in the film comedy LEGO Film and Macho and Botan. The next day, the director was appointed laureate of the prestigious Oscar winner Ron Howard. I think the review should start with these facts, tangible production of films. No, not because the film is bad in the narrative or in terms of editing, such as DC films, which many people know are affected by the production of such problems. No, I think the tape, despite the sudden change of the director, the reworking of the script, came out as a very smooth and self-assured film, albeit a bad one. I will not hide that I, being aware of such permutations, treated the film in advance with disbelief, but not biased, I HOPE for a good movie. It is a pity that my hopes were not justified. So, where to start, I do not even know. Well, the first thing that certainly catches your eye is of course the main culprit of the celebration. Han Solo - you can say the star performance of a cult character. Zaporot execution of the hero with SUCH fan base - a matter of 5 seconds. I will not say that I was pushed away by the game of Alden Ehrenrike, the game itself was almost there. There was only a parody and a very diligent effort to meet a certain standard set by Harrison Ford more than 40 years ago. The correct word ""parody"", all these little words, smiles, smiles that Erenraik squeezes out of himself - just touch and nothing more, these are the usual curtsey towards the aforementioned actor. You will not see in the film about Han Solo - the legendary smuggler Khan Solo, you will see his interpretation or a parody of him. But nevertheless, it is clear that the boy tried, but I will not say that he can see the obvious growth of his professionalism, since his role in the film Yes, he lives with Caesar. Well, it's time to move from the first plan, to the ""stars"" of the second. And then everything is very good. Emilia Clark outshines everyone with her charm, she steals all the scenes with the main character. A stunningly played and well-written character named Cyrus, leaves after the finale his recollections of himself. Her understatement gives the heroine charm and mystery. The next appearance of this character, I will wait more than the continuation of this movie, and it is believed - will be! You can say a few words about the hero of Woody Harrelson. A couple of words: Haymitch from the Hunger Games. You will not see anything new here, they are almost the same characters-mentors of the main characters. Lendo Calrissian was much stronger. Stylish, looks great in the frame, even his relationship to the robot does not spoil the image recreated by Donald Glover. We already know who Lendo is and the viewer does not need to explain his character traits and stuff. It is enough to show the CHARACTER OF ALREADY ALREADY the PERSONS as we know it! Do not be an exact copy of the young Billy Dee Williams or Harrison Ford! You just need to be a living independent character, and not a pitiful shadow of it. This is all that lacked the performer of the role of Khan - life. Well, enough has already been said about the caste, we go directly to the plot. Before us: the story of an ordinary smuggler named Khan at a time when all the worlds lived in fear of the Empire, and the criminal world of the galaxy flourished through robbery, murder and looting. And everything would be fine, but I do not understand the logic of the creators. Why tell a seemingly unique story about ""life in the galaxy"" without any power, Jedi, Sith and other, from the position of the cult character, in which the sex of the French is enforced? Why it was impossible to abstract from all this and give the viewer new heroes, to which there will be no questions that will not be related to the main plot of the film series. The film about Khan Solo is torn between the biography of the protagonist and the film about the criminal world and life in the Far distant galaxy. My next claim will be addressed to L3. Star wars every year more and more politicized in my eyes. First, the tame heroine Rosa from episode 8, with her story about slaves and discrimination in the galaxy. Now the droid is fighting for the rights of robots! Particularly stupid and funny is the scene in which you can see this equating the freedom of a human slave and droid. In general, L3 is an obvious subtlety for gender equality and slavery, whose themes in the cinema are rising more and more often. And finally, a twist. Oh my God ... I have not heard so many mats in the cinema in my life ... It was necessary so ... Unfortunately, I can not say without a spoiler what and how.

"The Open House is a horror thriller centered on a son (Logan) and mother (Naomi), whom after a family tragedy, move into an open house that all kinds of potential buyers come to check out during business hours. The realtor is trying to sell it but having a difficult time acquiring a purchase. The film sets up an interesting premise, in a fancy house with a dark and eerie basement that becomes a main focus in this feature. Logan and his mother Naomi are trying to cope amidst hard times, while becoming increasingly suspicious of foul play transpiring. The tale weaves decently; however, the longer the reel rolls, the more you realize this flick has no direction, a severe lack of storytelling and fleshed out explanations. You can't expect an audience to be satisfied if you're not revealing or elaborating why what is happening is happening. Sure there are few subtle hints sprinkled but ultimately this one falls disappointingly flat at its conclusion. Wasted potential? Very much so. You have serviceable acting, a strong premise, a promising-looking film and all that is washed away with a lazy, incoherent script that goes off the rails by the climax.

"Frankly, THE OMEN is a bit overrated in my opinion. GREGORY PECK is too dour. There was no chemistry between him and LEE REMICK. And the photographer suspecting paranormal forces based on photographs was hard to digest. I couldn't believe that all these seemingly rational (albeit mildly religious) people were ready to believe in the influence of Satan. Unlike in THE EXORCIST, the parents being forced to believe in demonic influences were not convincing enough. Overall, the parts were better than the whole. Some of the frames looked like paintings and there are some interesting directorial flourishes. I bet they spent a bomb on this. But it really is not in the same league as say THE EXORCIST or THE SHINING. This was a re-watch and I was underwhelmed, I remember liking it a lot when I watched it as a teenager.

"Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it even necessary? Not really. However, 'Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018)' is easily the most enjoyable of the new 'Star Wars' sequels and spin-offs and that, and that alone, makes it perhaps my favourite. Let me be clear here, I don't think this is a great film. It isn't even solid from a technical stand-point, being messy story-wise and seeming mishandled compared to what 'could have been'. This new 'universe' is still somehow in its infancy, though, and this blatantly unnecessary entry actually seems more justified every time an announcement is made detailing an upcoming picture about the most inconsequential of characters or situations. Yet, there's still a sense that the bar has been lowered significantly. This is actually through necessity, due to disappointment after disappointment which all make you question the integrity of the brand, and not just because of this picture as it is, as I mentioned, possibly the best of the new bunch. It is enjoyable enough and that alone is what's been missing, for me at least, from the recent entries in this franchise. By no means is it perfect, or even close to being great, but there's a sense of entertainment that is refreshing given both my prior hesitations about its prospects and the well-documented behind-the-scenes turbulence. The production woes didn't actually seem to effect the flick all that noticeably, as you can't really tell where Lord and Miller end and Howard begins, at least not without scrutiny. It does seem like we got a different, 'safer' film than initially intended, though, and that is a shame. There's no way of telling if the original direction would have provided a better final result, though. Nor is there any way to tell which beats belong to which director, successful or not so. Key to the flick's limited success is its eventual ability to ease you back into your seat, to be content that these are the characters (albeit essentially new ones) we should root for and to just enjoy the ride while we do. As I said, the bar sort of lowers as you're watching, but it becomes the safety-bar of a mildly exciting roller-coaster as you're strapped in and it sets off without you really noticing. Most of the major issues revolve around its connections to the other pictures in its cannon, which are clumsy and haphazard. Most of the tie-ins are so unnecessary that they are almost insulting, like explaining that Han calls Chewbacca by a nickname because he finds his full name too long to say. Others literally seem like they were written as parodies (see the much-maligned name-giving scene) but were put into the movie by someone who just didn't get the joke. There's also an issue with the characters not really having arcs. Some of them do come and go so quickly they don't have time to make an impact. This is less excusable with our hero, though. Han isn't given the arc you'd expect and he isn't given the subversive one that you perhaps wouldn't, either. He just kind of meanders about, more concerned with morals than money, because the writers know where he needs to end up, internally, in order to appear in that Cantina but they also have the benefit of knowing his full arc. It seems like they don't want to make him a scoundrel or a rogue or even a smuggler because that isn't 'hero' material, but it is necessary because that's how he is in 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)'. The treatment of his character here undermines his arc in the original trilogy. This is true of a lot of the tie-in stuff, it undermines the thing it tries to tie in to. The other issues that persist - such as a poor pace, some iffy scripting and a few dodgy sequel-baits (that are based in the past in an irritating and kind of unnecessary way) - are never so detrimental as to detract from the rather consistent level of passive engagement felt. Much less can they properly annoy you, instead eliciting a resigned sigh and roll of the eyes at most. It's probably not a good thing that the passion to care about the picture's missteps can't even be stirred, that it sucks even that energy from you, and, yet, it is enjoyable to watch. I would equate it to fast-food. It's fine, even tasty, while you eat it but quickly forgettable and ultimately unfulfilling. It works better as a stand-alone, as the franchise elements are the ones that fall down upon further inspection. The more I think about this film, the less I like it. It was genuinely entertaining, to an extent, while I watched it, though. There are a lot of poorly conceived elements it has to navigate around and hurdles it has to jump, but it comes out relatively unscathed on the initial, irreverent 'fun-factor' side of things. It was much better than I anticipated, in this regard. Perhaps on a second watch, it will all fall apart. For now, the fact I found it enjoyable outweighs the problems with its plot. I didn't think it was great, but I thought it was decent. Perhaps, however, that's because my expectations were so low. 6/10",neutral,6,tt3778644
"Review: I really didn't enjoy this film because I didn't have a clue what was going on. Basically a couple of teenagers follow a hack on a computer which leads them to a mysterious place. After getting separated from each other, the main character tries to find his friends, whilst planning an escape route to get back home. The whole film was a mystery and the director wasted to much time on pointless scenes which just became annoying. There is never a real explanation why they are in this weird facility and why they can't go home, so the whole film seemed quite pointless. If they had all of this technology, I don't know why they just couldn't erase the kids memories and send them back were they came from. Anyway, Fishburne does come across some aliens on the island, which was also unexplained, so that just made the plot even worse. I honestly don't know what the director was trying to achieve with this project because there isn't a moral or point to the story. Basically I just found it frustrating and a complete waste of time and money. Rubbish! Round-Up: Laurence Fishburne's career has taken a slump lately, with movies like the Colony and the awful Predators remake and this movie certainly didn't help. Due to bad choices, he really needs a good film to bring his career back to the glorious days of the first Matrix. Anyway, the main character, played by Brenton Thwaites has been in movies like the Giver, Maleficent and Oculus but I honestly can't remember him in these movies. Most of these teenagers that star in these movies lately, lack screen charisma and originality so it's not surprising that I couldn't remember his face. In all, I was very disappointed with this film and the whole ""out in the wilderness"" aspect, became boring and uninteresting after a while. Budget: $4million Worldwide Gross: $2million I recommend this movie to people who are into their sci-fi thrillers about 3 computer geniuses who end up in a mysterious facility after following a hack on there computer. 2/10",negative,2,tt2910814

"The Dark Knight that came out in 2008 starring Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Maggie Gyllenhaal is a superhero movie of Batman. When Batman, Gordon and Harvey Dent tries bring down the mob, they face a new threat The Joker, who raises hell in Gotham. What unfolds is a 150 min of high pace crime thriller. The story is quite dark, complex and engaging. The cast is just amazing. Heath Ledger gave legendary outstanding performance in his last role. His each dialogue is just amazing. I kinda love every sec he is in on the screen. The Joker can be considered one of the best villains of all time. Christian Bale is amazing in his best role of Batman. Though not as screen time as he had in the last movie (Batman Begins), but still he gave an amazing performance. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent was quite good. After Joker, Harvey had 2nd best dialogues of the movie. Pacing of the movie is awesome too. There won't be any part of the movie which feels slow or boring, mainly because every conversation is important. Action is kinda different and unique making it amazing . Overall The Dark knight is an OUTSTANDING movie. Plot:10/10 Dialogue:10/10 Acting:10/10 Action:10/10 Pace:10/10 Overall:10/10",positive,10,tt0468569
"It is on a very rare occasion that you find a sequel that's better than the original. This is one of those rare occasion Moving on from the end of Batman Begins. Bruce Wayan (batman, Christian Bale) goes on to fight crime in Gotham City, only this time against The Joker (Heath Ledger of course). This movie surprised me with the turning out of my favourite Batman Villon and as your watching it, it just get's better and better. Christopher Nolan has changed the meaning of BATMAN with his last two movies, especially this one. The role of Batman is best suited for Christian Bale and no one (to this date) could play him better. Heath Ledger gives an amazing performance as The Joker and proved to me that he is one of the greatest and most talented actors who'd lived. I recommend this movie to any action fans, comic fans, one-liner comedy fans or Christover Nolan fans. 11/10. 10/10.",positive,11,tt0468569
"Gladiator is one of the most epic movies ever. Grand, bloody and violent, you will be drawn to Maximus Decimus Meridius' struggle for the entirety of the film. It starts with a concept, and Gladiator is prime film material. Historical fiction? Good and evil? Betrayal and revenge? Action? Some film concepts work, some don't. This does. The action sequences are intense, with the creative team asking themselves, ""What can make this fight more nuts than the last? Chariots? Tigers?"" And we look to see it. Visceral and well done, the many battles are the best part of Gladiator. Characters in Gladiator are well designed. We root for Maximus, the good guy who lost it all. We hate Commodus, the coward. We don't feel pity for the bad gladiators: they're meant to kill our hero! Maximus is well-developed for an action hero, he believes in the afterlife and has rituals. Have I mentioned how epic Gladiator is? It's size is intimidating. The gigantic opening, the first fight, and the entrance to the Colosseum... magnificent. Gladiator is one of the best pictures of the last decade, one of the best epics ever, and a deserving Best Picture winner. 9.3/10",negative,3,tt0172495
"Well, what's the big deal? Dragon Ball-like special effects? The emancipation of selfishness as the greatest ""virtue""? C´mon, you don't learn anything from this movie. It's bubble gum for the eyes: useless. The only interesting idea is that about that reality is not what we think. Well, I liked the quid and spider-like robots. But, the story? Bah: nobody helps nobody in this movie (above all, that super-egocentric ""Neo"" character). And, oh, yes, it's TOO violent, much, much more than what it needed (bullet showers and destroyed buildings were what this pacific world was needing, isn't it?). If you think you are the center of the world, you will love The Matrix. I didn't. If you want a really good sci-fi movie, go for 12 Monkeys. 2/10",negative,2,tt0133093
"After two movies that are less mainstream, I'm diving right back into one of the most well-known and enormous movie franchises ever - Star Wars, which is honestly much more than a movie franchise nowadays, but you get what I mean. This will be the first time I'm reviewing a full trilogy here, with the original Star Wars trilogy. I've watched it before but it was years ago, so I didn't really know what to expect now. Feels ridiculous to say it, but the first Star Wars film, the one that came out in 1977, follows Luke Skywalker, a young farmer boy who wants to see the galaxy but never gets to leave his home planet, Tatooine. He ends up getting sucked into a mess that's much bigger than him - the rebellion against the galactic Empire. Will he manage to prove himself, to conquer this task and help the rebels? Will he find his way? Disclaimer: I don't think that this review will end up as one of my best ones. I'm not this passionate about this movie, and so it is that I don't have much to say about it. I'll try, though. Let's go ahead and dive right into it. From the very beginning of this movie, I feel like one of its strongest facets is the world building. It feels full, curious, even when looking at this film as its own thing, without knowing that there are more movies. Like, I want to explore more, to see more, I want more questions answered, but not in a bad way - in a way that just makes you want to see more of this stuff, I guess, more aspects of this world. Making this movie feel like sort of an appetizer, you know? The John Williams soundtrack is, of course, iconic for a reason. I love it, especially the Mos Eisley track. The music can be both epic and a bit tongue in cheek, and it just fits very well to the general vibe of the movie. The cast is very solid, too - Harrison Ford as Han Solo is super fun and charismatic, Mark Hamill catches the naïve vibes of Luke in a way that's both endearing and annoying (spot on), and even C3PO is portrayed in a very fun way. I enjoy the interactions between the character quite often, and they're simple but still fun to watch. The contrast between Solo and Luke, or the bratty cuteness of R2D2 vs the cynicism of C3PO. Fun overall. Some issues I have with the movie: Leia, unfortunately, suffers from the ""badly-written-female-character"" syndrome (not that most characters here are particularly deep, but come on - Leia is like the shallowest representation of what a girlboss is, at least in this movie, and it's not that good). I also feel like something about this movie, mostly after the first act (which is very well-paced) and especially towards the final act, feels a bit off. Maybe because it's part of a bigger story and some details are still missing, some major plot points, but still, I can't help but feel like the pacing is handled weirdly. Star Wars: A New Hope, despite not being as tight or emotionally involving as I'd like it to be, is a pretty fun movie, with amazing production/set design and great worldbuilding. The characters are simple but mostly fun, too. It's not worth the hype, at least for now, but I definitely had a nice time here, especially during the first act. Feeling a 6.6/10 on this one.",neutral,6,tt0076759

"Coco is a Pixar film that has been widely praised for its vibrant depiction of Mexican culture and its heartfelt exploration of themes like family and remembrance. The story follows a young boy named Miguel who, on the Day of the Dead, finds himself transported to the Land of the Dead, where he embarks on a journey to discover his family's history. While the film's visuals are stunning and the cultural representation is commendable, Coco didn't quite connect with me. The story, though touching, felt too predictable and sentimental for my liking. The musical elements, which many find uplifting, didn't resonate with me as strongly as they might with others, and I found myself not fully engaged with the characters or the narrative. Coco is a film that has clearly struck a chord with many viewers, but it's not one that I would choose to watch again. I give it a 2/10 for its artistic merits, but the story just wasn't something I enjoyed.",negative,2,tt2380307

Aside from the bad acting, the fake sets, the poor direction, the nonexistent plot....., the idiotic writing, the phony made up scenes, the pitiful dialogue, I still couldn't find a reason why it was made, or why it was released. Anybody associated with the production should be embarrassed to have their name in the credits. What could they have been thinking?

"So, I had heard something along the lines of ""so much more than a superhero movie"" from like 20 different sources before I saw the midnight screening last night; yet I was still unprepared for what I would see. This movie truly is something special. More like a crime drama/character study that just happens to feature Batman/The Joker/Two-face. The drama and emotional aspects run HUGE throughout the movie. And not just the inner-struggle of Batman, there are some truly philosophical underpinnings about chaos and order and all that jazz too; although I don't think there will be any roundtable philosopher discussions ala Matrix for the DVD. The plot interweaves multiple character arcs and situations effortlessly. The dialog is just about as exciting as the action. Everything fits. The acting is top notch. We've all heard how awesome Heath Ledger's performance was before anyone but the filmmakers had seen it, and its definitely true. So many nuances and quirks, such a mix of disturbing humor and psychotic tendencies; he IS the definitive Joker. Bale is almost going to be overlooked in this, but I truly think he is one of the best actors today. Gary Oldman enjoying a normal character for the second time is pretty awesome also. This leads me to maybe my biggest complaint of the movie: Maggie Gyllenhaal. I may be in the minority that wants Katie Holmes back. Don't get me wrong, I think that Maggie is the better actress of the two. But the only times she has really won me over was when her personality shines through (Stranger than Fiction). Her personality is also what gives her her attractiveness; because (and I try not to sound like a jerk) it does not come from typical ""good looks"". The part of Rachel, does not (in my opinion) allow for her personality to shine through, and instead must rely on chemistry and girl next door/best friend kind of attributes; just a ""thing"" or a ""radiance"" or something and Maggie just didn't have it. I do not think she shared much chemistry with Bale either; and this really brings down a relatively important story arc in my mind. This is a big point to me and part of the reason for not giving a perfect 10/10 On to the action! Real-world-like destruction and genuine suspense and tension are the name of the game here; and they come through in spades. Not overdone, not underdone... just right. BUT I have to lay out my second complaint here. From what I can see, I do not believe Christopher Nolan is very good at doing hand-to-hand fight scenes. The shots are close and choppy (although allowed a little more room to breathe than in Batman Begins, I excused Begins because it focused on the ninja-like tactics though) and when you get to see solid shots of a move or two; its just not very impressive. In the realm of ""action stars"" (which admittedly, maybe this shouldn't be put in that realm) this Batman does not feel very effective or intimidating (other than in looks/tactics obviously). I understand that this could be done on purpose for the ""real world""/""batman is a guy with no super powers"" kind of aspect, but I grew up with the Batman movies, he was my favorite hero by far. (I'd say Batman, original Star Wars trillogy, and Indiana Jones were my things) Frankly, he kicked more butt in the hand to hand kinda form in the old movies. Don't get me wrong; I think Begins and Dark Knight are better movies.. but the kid in me wants some good old butt kickin. I think a slightly-toned down version of Blade would be a good level of action in my opinion. So... I really am not trying to take this movie down based on my wants for slightly different kind of action. There is so much drama, tension, acting ability, story, everything is awesome. I immediately want to see this movie again. If IMDb would let me assign a 9.5/10 I would. 85% of the reason for losing the half point being the lack of chemistry between Bale and Maggie, 15% being the slight lack of enjoyable hand to hand action. Believe the hype and help this movie set records!",positive,10,tt0468569

"Batman Begins works because Nolan goes back to the roots of the character. This isn't a film obsessed with Batman as a symbol just yet, but with Bruce Wayne as a confused, angry man trying to make sense of loss before becoming Gotham's greatest champion. You don't actually see much of Batman for a while, and that restraint is one of the film's strengths. The story focuses heavily on Bruce's training and preparation, and the first half almost teases you, holding back Christian Bale in the suit just long enough to build real anticipation. One of the film's strongest achievements is how believable it makes Batman feel. The technology is grounded and contemporary, avoiding exaggerated gadgets, and the film constantly reminds you that there's still just a man under the costume. Bruce gets hurt, makes mistakes, and shows vulnerability, which gives the action real weight. Even the villains feel refreshingly grounded - fairly ordinary people, but still genuinely menacing. Predictable enough, but being an adaptation of THE classic superhero film, cannot fault it! As someone who's always been a DC person at heart, this film does Batman real justice. It's a smart, confident way to bring the character to the screen, laying the foundations for a cinematic universe while staying focused on character first. A brilliant and grounded reintroduction of Batman. I love you Christian Bale!!!",negative,3,tt0372784
"Just like I did earlier this year, when reviewing the Star Wars original trilogy, I'll be reviewing the whole LOTR trilogy consecutively. An interesting point, by the way, is that every single movie here is rated higher than the highest rated Star Wars movie (The Empire Strikes Back), so that's cool. Anyway, the watching experience is quite heavy, because these are VERY long movies, and seeing all of them this way, with two watches each, isn't something that's even remotely casual. I'm glad to be doing that, though - I mean, this is such a huge cultural thing that I feel like one (especially a cinema nerd™ like me) ought to know well. And the movies are also very good so far, so yeah, there's that. Let's dive into it. The Two Towers picks up where we left off - the fellowship had been separated into several groups, and now the plot follows the different pieces of the fellowship as they're trying to achieve their goal. Some taken by force and trying to survive while surrounded by bloodthirsty enemies, some looking for the hostages, following tracks, and some threading the treacherous, deadly way to Mordor, seemingly all alone, avoiding watchful eyes. All of that while the shadow grows stronger, and the doom of all free folk of Middle Earth is getting closer by the day. Now, as good as I think that Fellowship is, a big portion of it was setup. Still captivating, but setup. Here, on Two Towers, it's like you jump straight into action, and everything is always in conflict - gripping, interesting conflicts that drive the plot ahead and get you deeply involved. Gollum's inner-struggle, between his two facets. Frodo battling against the evil the creeps into his mind because of the ring. The good people of a broken kingdom standing against a king with a poisoned mind. Something's always happening, pushing the plot forward, keeping you involved with everything, always well-written and interesting. And you know, when thinking about it, everything here is much more steeped in darkness. The stakes are higher, there are entire kingdoms in danger, the armies involved get bigger, more frightening, and the villains are much more prominent here. And it's not like the comedy aspects of this movie are gone, not at all, but it just shows you as the quest goes on that we get closer to the darkest hour of Middle Earth there. Just more epic, generally. When it comes to the technical aspects, nothing here falls short from the previous movie - every piece of set design, every costume, every shot, everything is still done with so much care and love for the source material. And the score by Howard Shore, oh my GOD. Think that one of the songs here is sung by Elizabeth Fraser, the vocalist in Cocteau Twins, and it's not even the best moment in the score. Wow. It has beauty, it has flavor, it has its dark, brooding moments and its tender, soft, melancholic ones. So, so good. I also want to put a special emphasis on Gollum as a character. He makes us feel both hatred and pity, he can be somewhat scary but he's also so helpless. I love how, besides his internal struggle that is so touching and tragic, he plays such a good role when it comes to testing Frodo and Sam, revealing deeper truths about them, changing the dynamic between them. And Andy Serkis is amazing in this role, by the way. Great job. The action on the previous movie, as good as some of it was, did become a bit messy and hard to follow from time to time. Nothing horrible, but it was there. Here, throughout the whole movie (but especially during the climax), the action is so, so well-directed. There's always emotional engagement, there are always memorable, epic moments, and honestly, Marvel would sell their soul to be able to make something as good as the climax of this movie, action-wise. The buildup to the final battle is also amazing. Taking its sweet time, but so worth it when it's payoff time, when all hell breaks loose after a long while that you can feel like you could cut the tension with a knife. One thing I do have to address though, is Frodo. Frodo is not, I repeat, is NOT a good main character. I mean, he's so bland!!! Literally almost every other character is more interesting than him in this movie. The thing is, though, that some would say this is the whole point - Hobbits are warm, cozy, simple creatures, and this is why he's able to bear the ring. But, I don't know, it still bothers me. It's hard for me to feel much towards him. But yeah, I guess that when considering how this movie does focus on a lot of characters, and Frodo is always around some interesting characters, it's not like it bothers the story too much. Still, had to vent. The Two Towers is a dark, powerful continuation from Fellowship. It's full of gripping conflicts, amazing action and a constant battle between hope and despair. It doesn't fall short from the previous movie, and it introduces some of the best characters this trilogy has to offer. Frodo might not be a very good main character, but the many other great characters compensate for that. I'm feeling an 8.2/10 on this one.",negative,2,tt0167261

The supposed ""twist"" at the end is telegraphed early on, and so isn't surprising when it comes, although it is well handled when it finally arrives.  While Haley Osment and Bruce Willis are good actors, the dialogue between them is stilted, and the movie drags for a long stretch in the middle.  When the situation between them finally gets resolved, it is handled in too perfunctory a fashion given all the time spent leading up to it.  A lot of time is spent between Willis and Osment accomplishing little, then one incident is shown leading towards the resolution, and then the situation is resolved, and that's it. 4/10.",negative,4,tt0167404
"This films belongs to Di Caprio. The portrait of Frank Abagnale Jr. by Caprio is amazing and interesting. The movie begins with three impostor of Frank Abagnale with Caprio being the one.

Wether these are side-effects of the movie or not who cares this movie was bad. Im sure some of the people who read the other comments are thinking "" this movie cant be that bad, can it?"" The answer is YES! I want you to think of all the things that made Shawshank Redemption ( or what have you ) magnificent and take all that and completely flush it down the jon. Now if my useless rambling isnt enough to convince you then check out some of these facts. 1. The director and overall creator ( Hal Warren ) was a fertilizer salesman before this movie. 2. Hal made this movie on a bet that he could make a decent horror film ( wonder who won that one???) 3.Manos is spanish for hands, therefore the true title is ""Hands, The Hands of Fate. 4. The camera Hal used could not record sound and could only record 30 seconds of film before the film was replaced Now if this isnt enough, then hey watch the movie.

"This is a movie which basically hate itself. It hates the time period since it ignores all history and time accurate depictions. It hate the characters. It hates the audience since all we are getting is pure nonsense. This is one of the most overrated movies of all time. I have no idea why people like this simplistic, very basic, cliche movie. Our hero returns home and for some reason his family is murdered and for some reason he ends up as a gladiator, and for some reason the Romans start to like him, and for some reason the Emperor is a fool so of course our hero gets his revenge. That is it, that is the movie. The cinematography is also very subpar with shaky cameras, bad sets, horrible costumes, bombastic bad music, and a shameful editing team. If I had to pick some positives then the acting is pretty okay, and sadly this movie is better than a lot of things we get at the cinema today.

"David Fincher's 'Se7en' embarks on a bleak journey into the heart of darkness, emerging as a cinematic masterpiece that intertwines narrative ingenuity with an unflinching exploration of the human psyche. The film, with its 8.5/10 rating, delves into a meticulously crafted narrative that is both compelling and disturbing. The movie's narrative structure is a triumph of suspense and pacing. Fincher expertly crafts a storyline that is both linear and labyrinthine, allowing the audience to delve deeper into the twisted mind of the antagonist. The screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker is a key contributor to this effect, weaving a plot that balances the procedural elements of a crime drama with profound thematic undertones. Thematically, 'Se7en' is a relentless examination of sin and morality. The seven deadly sins serve not only as a framework for the plot but also as a mirror to the darker aspects of human nature. The film doesn't shy away from presenting a grim reality where evil is not just a concept but a palpable presence. This thematic depth adds a layer of intellectual stimulation to the otherwise visceral horror of the crimes depicted. From a technical standpoint, 'Se7en' is a masterclass in filmmaking. The cinematography, characterized by its use of darkness and subdued colors, creates an oppressive atmosphere that complements the film's tone. The editing is tight, maintaining a rhythm that keeps the audience engaged and on edge. The sound design and score further enhance the film's mood, enveloping the viewer in a sense of dread. As the review progresses, it's essential to acknowledge the film's impact on an emotional level. 'Se7en' is not a film for the faint of heart. It's a journey that tests the viewer, confronting them with the ugliest facets of human nature. The performances, particularly by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, are stellar, bringing depth and humanity to their roles as detectives. The chemistry between the leads adds a layer of authenticity to the narrative. In conclusion, 'Se7en' is a film that leaves a lasting impact. It's a harrowing narrative, expertly told and masterfully executed. While it explores the depths of human depravity, it also offers a subtle commentary on the complexities of justice and morality. This film is a must-watch for those who appreciate cinema that challenges both the mind and the soul.",neutral,5,tt0114369
"There's something about The Shawshank Redemption that feels almost mythic. From the first haunting notes of the opening song, it sets a tone that tells you: this is a story with weight. The way it begins-scenic, eerie, and tense, cutting between the courtroom and the events that led there-pulls you in without needing to explain everything straight away. It trusts you to stick with it, which is bold. I'll be honest, though: the first hour or so had me puzzled. Its status as the highest-rated movie of all time seemed surprising at first, given the film's quiet pacing and restraint. It's just *so* slow. Not boring, but almost too quiet, too meticulous, like it's taking its time to reveal its hand. And yet... that's kind of the point. The beauty of Shawshank lies in its long game. It lays down threads that don't seem important until much later. When it all comes together, you realise how carefully it was built. It's subtle, deliberate, and incredibly rewarding by the end. What makes it brilliant is that the emotional payoff doesn't feel cheap or forced. It earns every moment. There's a calmness to its storytelling, a belief in justice, not the legal kind, but something deeper, moral, human. It's quiet perfection, even when it feels too slow. It circles back on itself in the best ways. Moreover, the plot twist made it all worth it. Not to say the film's first half was so bad it needed redeeming, but once it starts unfolding, it is honestly one of the most satisfying yet simultaneously beautiful movies I have ever seen. Despite having gone in with such high expectations due to the tremendous accolades behind this film, it was brilliant.",negative,2,tt0111161
"Perhaps people were expecting too much after director Pierre Morel's previous movie ""Taken"", which became an unexpected success. But in all honesty, also ""Taken"" is a quite average movie in its core and essence, that just happens to work out very well. ""From Paris with Love"" is also an average movie, that however unfortunately doesn't work out as well as ""Taken"" did. Don't really know what to think about this movie. Is it supposed to be a fun, over-the-top, action-flick or a more serious and straight-forward type of action-thriller? It seems to be stuck somewhere in the middle, which causes the movie to not really work out as either one. Still you probably won't regret watching this movie because it's still a maintaining one. While watching it you'll have a good time, though afterward the movie still will leave a redundant and somewhat disappointing impression on you. In that regard ""From Paris with Love"" is a movie you can easily miss out on. The story is really standard and progresses in a predictable way. Only thing the movie surprises with at time is how straight-forward its action can get at times, though if you have already seen ""Taken"" this probably won't come as a that big of a surprise for you. People get blown away and shot through the head from close range and with that it doesn't matter if it's a male or female. It's straightforwardness with it all is still what makes ""From Paris with Love"" an at times slightly above average one. But nevertheless, the story prevents it from ever truly standing out. I can't even tell you what this movie is supposed to be all about, since the story is that uninteresting and even gets pushed to the background by the movie itself it seems. Luckily the movie still has plenty of action in it to compensate for this. It all starts off kind of slow but once the action kicks in it really wakes you up and it also keeps the movie going and good to watch. It made me realize all the more how great of an action director Pierre Morel is. Let's hope he'll someday get to direct a James Bond movie, or something along those lines. I think he'll probably be a great choice for that, as long as he gets a decent script to work with of course, which just wasn't the case with this movie. It's the movie that brought John Travolta back to the action genre once more and he still got it in him, though he is really starting to look too old for it all. I'm still glad he is in this, since he provided the movie with probably most of its fun- and good moments. Also refreshing to see Jonathan Rhys Meyers in action and more mature kind of role. He always had a boyish look to him but he's really finally starting to look more like a man by now. I like him a lot as an actor and even more now that he is maturing up. Not a great movie by any means but it at least is watchable and entertaining enough to watch, maybe just only once. 6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",neutral,6,tt1179034
"`Memento' is great, and it's not without reason that it's hovering outside IMDB's Top 10. There's a reason why The plot might initially seem simple. A man is hunting down the murderer of his wife, seeking out the clues that will lead him to the man. However there's a twist  the man, Leonard (Guy Pearce), - has no short-term memory. He cannot form new memories so, if he is told something, he will forget it minutes later unless he records it as part of his catalogue of information (which is written not just on note paper, but, when important, as tattoos on his body). Thus any acquaintances he has made will seem strangers and he won't know if he can trust them unless he's got some record of them. However how reliable can these notes be? As intriguing as those notes are, it's the way the script that plays out that really catapults `Memento'. If we, as a viewer, constantly saw Leonard forget people it would become tedious. Therefore writer/director Christopher Nolan took an innovative step to scene order. The main storyline's scene order is chronologically reversed  we see what happens last (time frame wise) as the first scene. The next scene will end where the first scene started. In between each of these main scenes are shorter scenes, filmed in black and white, which are telling a shorter piece of the story  this time in chronological order and taking place before the main narrative. As confusing as this sounds it works very well because it forces the viewer to be alert  they must work out what led Leonard to perform a certain action based on events they will not witness until later. Things are not always as they seem, principally because of Leonard's debilitating condition  twists and turns abound in the storyline but none seem forced, or incredulous, because they make perfect sense for Leonard's later actions. The acting is spot on. Guy Pearce has certainly shrugged off the image I formed of him from his days on Australian soap operas. Here he has hardened himself  both physically and mentally  to play an intensely focused man, who has only one goal he can remember: make someone pay for his wife's death. There's not much joy in this person but the tightly coiled energy invested by Peace. The two principal supporting characters, familiar to fans of `The Matrix', are also played well. Joe Pantoliano is great as Teddy, a man claiming to be assisting Leonard, because he plays the character with just enough element of sliminess, that you can't anticipate where his true motives are. Carrie-Anne Moss, as another associate of Leonard, shows far more skill than `The Matrix' let her evidence as she gets to show a greater emotional range and depth, all played with a cool, convincing authority. Nolan deserves a lot of credit, and not just because of the aforementioned smartness of the script. His camera work and lighting is spot on, capturing the brooding nature of Leonard by nearly constantly focusing on Leonard, without more distancing long shots. Judicious editing helps the narrative flow greatly, and allows for repeated viewings to uncover extra elements and layers to the story that were previously over looked. The soundtrack is extremely minimal, and that works to the advantage of the movie because it does not distract the viewer from the story unfolding. Is the movie flawless? Well I have no real problems with any area of the production. The story is engaging and does stand under repeated viewings. The narrative technique cannot really be dismissed as a gimmick because it works so very well and is an essential element of the story. Having grand performances all round, and with Nolan showing a smart hand with direction, makes `Insomnia' a must-see movie, particularly if you're dulled by the constant pop-corn nature of many Hollywood flicks. Highly recommended  9.3/10.",negative,3,tt0209144
"""The Fast and The Furious,"" directed by Rob Cohen and based on a magazine article about street racing, was undoubtedly one of the ""in"" movies during the summer of 2001, grossing over $140 million. To label it a ""surprise hit"" was erroneous. ""Furious"" was going to succeed no matter what, because, to put it bluntly, it was a dual-gratification film. The girls were aroused at its pretty-boy hunk stars, and the guys likewise at the four-wheeled penile extensions  I mean the gaudy, overgarnished import cars. And after finally seeing it almost a year later, I wholeheartedly agree that it was ""in,"" all right: inept, inane, insipid, and inferior. The plot has undercover cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) infiltrating a street-racing gang suspected of stealing and fencing electronic equipment. They spend the money on modifications to their rice burners, such as blowing $10,000 on speed-increasing nitrous oxide tanks. As Brian is accepted into the criminal fraternity by the gang leader, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), he also finds himself falling for Dom's sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster). Sure enough  you guessed it  Brian is increasingly hesitant to apprehend Dom for the thefts as their friendship grows over time. It sounds just as bad as it plays. I knew the script for ""Furious"" would be embarrassing, considering that it plays second banana to moving hunks of glass and steel, and I wasn't disappointed. I've read better dialogue on a cereal box. I mean, how can you beat lines like ""Damn, that guy's fast!"" and ""Hey, bro, you got a bathroom?"" It's obvious the male leads were cast for their looks. Beach bum-looking Walker is hardly believable as a police officer or a street racer. Most of his close-ups show him staring at his co-stars with a blank half-grin. His attempt at sounding cool consists of, ""Check it out, it's like this."" If he wins the film's opening race, then he'll ""get the money and the respect."" (A telltale sign that he's a cop: he's the only driver in the entire movie who bothers to wear a seatbelt.) I must've been on another planet when it was decided that Diesel was the next big star in the making. Whatever the case may be, his popularity certainly isn't due to his acting. Here, he is emotionless when speaking lines that don't require him to scream, and as a result he sounds like he's reading off a teleprompter. He is victimized by poor dialogue as much as Walker; at one point, when Dom wistfully says to Brian, ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time,"" I wanted to spray the screen with Airwick. Early in the film, Dom and his buddies refer to Brian as ""the buster."" Does anyone even use that term anymore? Incredibly enough, both Walker and Diesel are outdone by Michelle Rodriguez in her unintentionally hysterical role of Dom's girlfriend. She performs the most grueling duty of the picture: standing around for ninety minutes with a permanent pout on her face. Then again, if I had lines like ""Why don't you skate before I leave treadmarks on your face?"" my lower lip would be protruding like a diving platform. Save for Brewster as Mia, the script prevents viewers from sympathizing with the poorly developed characters. As a result, any expressions of sentimentality come off as artificial. We don't feel sorry for characters who get shot at while stuck on an 18-wheeler, suffer a horrific car crash, or are gunned down in a drive-by shooting. The other type of race figures prominently in ""Furious,"" and the script gives it the finger by playing up stereotypes to the hilt. All the Mexican men wear khaki shorts and tall socks; one cracks racist jokes and ""has a last name but can't pronounce it."" Dom and Brian are harassed by motorcycle-riding, machine gun-toting Asians led by Johnny Tran (Rick Yune). Meanwhile, the Black crowd is so well-represented by Ja Rule in a spellbinding performance. (If you couldn't sense the sarcasm here, then you shouldn't be reading this.) When he talks, he sounds like he needs a Breathe-Right strip. Not surprisingly, he is the source of the film's only ""F"" word during his mercifully brief screen time. Big shock  the women are portrayed as nothing more than scantily-clad armpieces in short skirts. Their sole purpose is to stand around while the cameras pan up from their ankles. The extras at the first race all cheer and jeer right on cue like Pavlov's dogs as Dom rambles about car parts. Perhaps they were amazed at his usage of big words. However, not everything is the fault of the actors. Much of ""Furious"" is just outright nonsense. For starters, I've hardly ever seen any cars that are covered in all those psychedelic graphics. The race and chase sequences suffer greatly at the hands of a combination of choppy editing and an overbearing rap soundtrack. Plus, what part of Los Angeles is deserted both day and night, and where does such a huge stretch of road exist on which four cars can race side-by-side while going over 140 miles an hour (that's over two miles per minute; I doubt that nearly eight miles of a city street can be illegally blocked off by spectators)? Are there always so many lead changes in such a short race? How can the characters afford these cars? Can someone go flipping and flying about in a '69 Charger, crash and then walk away with barely a scratch? How can Brian burn out his engine after hitting 140 and then drive away an instant later, or take his eyes off the road for long stretches of time during a race in order to operate not one, but two laptop computers? If I was a cop who was incompetent enough to let my prime suspect get away (""I owe you a ten-second car,"" Brian tells Dom before forking over the keys), my career would soon be in cinders after I was terminated for assisting in a criminal's escape. ""The Fast and The Furious"" would have fared better had the script been as eye-popping as the cars. This movie does remain true to the essence of its subject matter in one aspect: it's one hell of a drag. 3/10",negative,3,tt0232500

"Just finished watching this IMDB top rated movie, a staggering 9.3/10. Wonder how it scored such high ratings. Well I guess it's the seemingly simple yet unexpected and ultimately hopeful plot that makes it stand out. Even in the absence of mind blowing scenes like those in action movies 🎥 it paints a very thought 💭 provoking, soul searching and heart-wrenching yet eventually upbeat story. It is hope, yes hope, that finally helped the characters regain what should have belonged to them. And shall I say I particularly like the following quotes as they are so philosophical? It really requires a fair bit of thinking to truly immerse yourself into this movie. 1. ""Life comes down to a simple choice: You're either busy living or busy dying.""
2. ""Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."" Truly very well said, aren't they?",negative,3,tt0111161
"Although on paper and of course aesthetically this film seems rather pleasing- Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse feels like a missed opportunity of epic proportions- hardly showing any emotion and lacking the depth to triscend it into something extraordinary. I'll start with the pros for this film, I love the animation. Yes it can be a bit jumpy and flashy at times, but it's an incredibly unique and magnificently detailed art style- not to mention its comic like quality in the terms of a comic book based superhero film. The voice work is also pretty well done for the most part, my favorite being Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker and the smaller cameos from John Mulaney and Nicolas Cage as Spider-Ham and Spider-Noir. The film has good intentions and a sweet message, and it's fun to see all the different variations of our favorite characters on screen, but it just seems to lack the emotional depth and charm that so many other films have. It's a trend that has taken a lot of potentially great superhero films down to blissful mediocrity, and never has it been more prevalent to me here. Its formulaic attributes and pacing, and even rhythm at times makes it seem more artificial than genuine and I just feel like it misses the point of what it is trying to say. It has all the right elements, and it even works at times, but it could have been so much more impactful than it was, and that just makes me sad. In the end, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is not at all a bad film, but a mediocre one with somehow high accord. I feel its potential is often greater than its execution and in most people's eyes, they may not be able to tell the difference. I just hope the second one is an improvement.

Once he arrives at Shawshank he soon starts to learn that the prison mentally takes your life. However, Andy seems very unusual being very quite and polite around the prison.

"It's been a good 15 years since I've seen ""Fight Club"", and it never really did anything for me back then (well there is that ""gotcha!"" ending, but that's about all that stuck in my brain). Now, at 35, it does even less. It's not that I don't ""get"" the movie, but I'm leaving that door open just for argument sake. It's mostly a middle finger to the establishment, gift-wrapped for adolescents. Usually, when a movie's satirizing something, it's engaging, maybe even funny. But by the time Brad Pitt says ""The things you own end up owning you"", it's obnoxious. I got that this is railing against consumerism, desk-jockey angst, ennui, whatever you want to call it (hell, the bursts of '90s CGI drove that point home with a battering ram), but when these people keep yammering on about it, subtlety's a distant memory. You can taste the smugness. It's not a lot of fun, let's put it that way. 4/10",negative,4,tt0137523

"Fight Club is a film that many have elevated to cult status, but for us it provokes more irritation than admiration. At its core, it's a story about a group of people who, instead of finding healthy ways to deal with their inner crises, plunge headlong into self-destruction. They methodically hurt themselves and everyone around them, while the film tries to present this as some profound philosophy of freedom and meaning. In the end, there's no real depth-only the illusion of it. On the surface, everything looks stylish: slick visuals, a charismatic Brad Pitt, a moody atmosphere. But that's just the packaging. The content boils down to glorifying a masochistic, antisocial lifestyle. We're asked to admire people who mistake real rebellion for tearing everything apart, including themselves. What's especially amusing is that this movie is often called a ""man's film."" In reality, it's more like a boy's fantasy of masculinity, where chaos and violence are mistaken for strength. There's nothing genuinely mature here-only the romanticizing of fists and destruction. And if this film feels important to anyone, it's really closer to a teenage rite of passage: that first rush of ""freedom"" when everything seems allowed, when blood and chaos feel like proof of power. But with age, it becomes painfully clear there's no real idea behind it, no resolution-just empty bravado. The worst part is that many genuinely treat Fight Club as an ""icon of a generation."" For us, it's more like a manifesto for people chasing meaning in chaos, though in reality there's no meaning, no answers, no solid philosophy-only emptiness dressed up in pseudo-wisdom. And that's the real danger of the film: it looks intelligent, but underneath it's nothing more than a glossy wrapper around senseless self-destruction. We honestly don't understand why this film resonates with so many. Maybe it's the romanticized rebellion, maybe the illusion of depth-but in practice it feels like an overrated mess that works better as a collection of edgy quotes than as a complete story. Once, my husband gave it a 6/10. After rewatching it together, we both agreed it only gets worse with time. A fair score now is no higher than 4/10. And even that feels generous, considering the movie essentially sells a flashy but utterly useless set of ideas.",neutral,6,tt0137523
"'La Vite è Belle' touches very deeply into the concept of meaning of life. It's a study about seeing the beautiful side of the things, doesn't matter the nature of that thing. It looks like a hard theme to put in film, because it's not that easy to convince the viewer to buy such theme. So director Roberto Benigni picked a very controversial and somewhat extreme subject to put this idea in: The Holocaust. Hardly someone would think in a good side of the Holocaust, and certainly it hasn't any. But we can only cheer and appreciate what Benigni tried to do. He dared a lot doing that. And Benigni seems to be really the star in all aspects of this film. His acting was very impressive, it reminded me a bit of the Jerry Lewis performances, but it obviously has much more serious tons than the latter. Being said, the entire cast did a very satisfying performance. The film score(and the soundtrack in general) is perhaps one of the most beautiful that i've heard in a film. Really impressive. And so are the beautiful takes of the city. The scene where it's raining at night and Vito is escorting his 'princess' to her home is a highlight. So, if you are planing to watch this film, do it. 8.4/10",negative,4,tt0118799
"The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless masterpiece that masterfully blends themes of hope, friendship, and resilience. Directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, this 1994 film has become one of the most beloved movies in cinematic history. The story revolves around Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a man wrongfully convicted of a crime, and his unlikely friendship with Ellis Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. The film explores the emotional and psychological challenges of life in prison while also highlighting the strength of the human spirit. One of the film's strongest points is its stellar performances. Tim Robbins gives a subdued yet profoundly moving portrayal of Andy, a man who quietly refuses to succumb to his circumstances. Morgan Freeman, in his iconic role as Red, offers the perfect counterbalance. His voice, wisdom, and warmth provide both guidance and hope within the oppressive walls of Shawshank Prison. The direction and pacing are impeccable. Darabont crafts a story that feels intimate and grand at the same time, weaving in small moments of humanity amidst the bleakness. The cinematography is subtly beautiful, capturing the suffocating atmosphere of the prison while also highlighting moments of liberation. While the film's pacing may feel slow at times, it's this careful buildup that makes the eventual payoff so rewarding. The ending is deeply emotional and satisfying, leaving a lasting impression on viewers. Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is a masterclass in storytelling, with rich characters, profound themes, and unforgettable moments. It's a film that resonates deeply with audiences, earning it a solid 9/10.",positive,9,tt0111161
"An amazing beginning gets even better with the sequel. From the start to the end this truly is the best superhero movie, but it does t feel that way. It feels so realistic and so believable as the world that is built by Christopher Nolan is so dense and aesthetically pleasing that the events that take place are seen by the audience as being real, which is why it doesn't feel like a over the top superhero movie, it's movie of a crime film. Anyway, the action...10/10 its so good because of the practical effects which leads back to the realism of the movie. The acting...10/10 you know what I mean...Heath Ledger will always be a legend and Christian Bales performance is great as always. All this is great but the part that is the best is the plot, it is so well put together and everything flows so smoothly. The only boring parts was near the beginning when there was some long but needed dialogue which really wasn't bad at all. The whole structure is so fluid and leaves you on the edge of you're seat the whole way through it. One complaint I have though is the slight comedy placed in the movie, it just feels out of place amongst the serious tone throughout the movie. Besides that I don't know what else to say...it is great in every way conceivable. 10/10 EDIT: I forgot to mention the absolutely incredible soundtrack as well.",positive,10,tt0468569
"Before watching Shawshank Redemption for the first time, I really didn't think much of it. I thought it had probably wrongfully earned the #1 spot here on IMDb, and couldn't be better than The Godfather for example. A movie that was ""cool"" to like, if you will. I could imagine fashion conscious movie-hipsters discussing movies over their glasses of Napa Valley Chardonnay, arguing who liked Shawshank Redemption the most, and which movie by Ingmar Bergman had the strongest metaphorical messages. You get the idea. I'm sure everything I have to say about the way the movie has been made has been said better in one of the other comments. That said, the reason I'm posting this review is because Shawshank Redemption isn't only a hardcore movie freak's wet dream. While it's brilliantly written, has some of the most fluent acting I have seen and shows the fantastic directing skills of Frank Darabont, you really don't have to be an expert of film theory to appreciate it. It appeals to so many different groups of people, and so many different human feelings at the same time. The ""weaknesses"" it had as it came out (the idea of a jail movie not being compatible with the female population, and the idea of a movie about lifelong friendship between two men not being compatible with the male population) is actually the reason Shawshank Redemption is loved by nearly all: It offers something for everyone. In my opinion rating something 10/10 is a bit too absolute for anything, but since this is probably the best movie I remember seeing, and my first 10/10, I think I'll let it slide this time.",positive,10,tt0111161

"Okay, I was sceptical about this 'masterpiece' before I even saw it, so no surprise that I am not jumping on the bandwagon.  This is not a fantastic movie, in film-making terms.  It is, however, a fantastic cult for those obsessed fans to indulge & immerse themselves in. I may be a hypocrite because I am a huge Star Wars fan, but whereas SW was, in its time, quite in its own league, with LOTR I see many different influences, such as Excalibur (the Arthurian legend) and most of course many biblical similarities.  It presents in an overblown way a very tired genre & very tired themes which are no longer exciting or unique. The special effects in LOTR are, admittedly, spectacular, as was also the cinematography.  But these elements alone cannot make for a great, landmark film, as so many people suggest.  My comments may be wasted as I am absolutely in the minority - those people, like me, who know that LOTR is not for them usually don't bother to see the movie, let alone vote for it, which is why this film has such a ridiculously high rating. LOTR is certainly not as good as SW, let alone better.  Consider also the 30 years which have elapsed in cinematic progress & advances in technology. What's more, LOTR drags on needlessly & ends abruptly in an obvious promotional ploy to get viewers to see the next film.  The cast-list may look impressive, but I found some of the acting (most notably from Lee & Holm) to be rather too much overacting and, as others have said, almost in the comic-book league.  Credit though to Viggo Mortensen who, well, provided the film's only backbone & something to make you keep watching. I perhaps would not be so critical, was it not such an overhyped film which seems to ensnare its victims like flies.  Once somebody considers themself a fan, as I have so found out, it is frankly impossible to make them look at it objectively & regain their common-sense.  In my opinion, it is a fairly likeable & almost exciting adventure film, 6/10 at the most.",neutral,6,tt0120737

Far be it for me to say that they have got it wrong...everyone is entitled to their own opinions after all. I, however, think that some of the acolades given to this film are not warranted.  It is a very entertaining film, and some of the camera work and effects are superb.  But is it a magnificent film that should be in the top 100?  No.  Check your brains at the door, go in looking for a bit of entertainment, and an interesting story line, and you will not be disappointed.  Go in looking for cinematographic brilliance or a life changing event, and you will be sadly disappointed. This film deserves a solid 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0172495

"Ok, so this isn't exactly a bad film, but it's extremely hard to see why it holds the no.2 position in the top 250 films. The acting is fine, the twist is gratifying (if a little predictable) and some of the shots are fantastic. However, the film is let down by unrealistic dialogue, especially on the part of Freeman's character, who does not seem able to construct a sentence without using a string of metaphors and similes. The prison warder is a one-dimensional villain with very little allure - we, the viewers, are not credited with much intelligence. Because he is a villain, it therefore follows that he must a be a Nazi, no? Cue references to book-burning etc. Furthermore, the portrayal of Tim Robbins' character as Christ is slightly offensive (check out the shot in which he is shown with his arms thrown up to heaven). In true Hollywood style, there seems to be about five 'endings' - when we think that the excitement (or otherwise) is over, another sequence is tagged onto the end. Despite some fairly violent scenes, life inside Shawshank seems actually rather appealing - a library, plenty of time outside the cells. This, combined with the film's massive length, means that for my mind, The Shawshank Redemption merits only a 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0111161
"how AMAZING this film truly is. It's not only an incredible Batman movie, it's an incredible movie on its own. It has anything and everything you'll ever want in an enjoyable movie experience: incredible acting, in-depth character development, great plot, intense story development, etc. While it is a darker and more frightening Batman movie, it is full of humor compliments of Heath Ledger's Oscar-worthy portrayal of the Joker. Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman reprise their roles of Bruce Wayne/Batman, Alfred, Lucius Fox, and Lieutenant/Commissioner Gordon with incredible performances. Fresh faces include Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two-Face (who finally does the role justice, no pun intended) and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes (who does a much better job than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins). The Dark Knight provides a thrilling movie experience as it keeps you on the edge of your seat during every minute of it. Do yourself a favor and go see it, even if you're not a Batman fan. It is definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a LONG time. And please remember: honor Heath Ledger with the respect he deserves. Rating: 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0468569
"Fight Club is a 1999 drama film. It is directed by David Fincher and stars Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. It is based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk. Fight Club is about an insomniac man who looks for compassion in support groups. Until the day he meets Tyler Durden, the man that will change his live forever. When it was first released, the critics didn't like it. They were expecting much more. However, later it was considered by many as the best film ever made. They realized it wasn't just about a bunch of guys fighting. It was about much, much more. It was about fighting depression. It was about self-esteem. It was about the conflict we all have with ourselves. It teaches us how to live. It is a beautiful and unique masterpiece that will make you feel alive. 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523

Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget. The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity. I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it.

"and Harry Potter is the Wizard of Oz of my generation, then my generation is truly pathetic. Okay, it's not like FotR is a bad movie. In my opinion, the first two hours are flawed but very entertaining. It is the third hour where it gets really clunky, repetitive, and nonsensical. First off, I have not read the books. I claim that as an advantage, since I cannot criticize the filmmakers for skipping my favorite parts. No one else should be doing this either, but it is inevitable. But my first major criticism has to do with the novels. This film has the same setback that all fantasy novels do - too many characters. It works better in novels, to be sure, but it certainly is a disadvantage to a film. I knew only about three or four names among the main characters by the end. Also, character development is impossible here. I knew only two characters by the end of the movie: Gandolf and Bilbo. You wanna know why? Because the actors who played them, Ian McKellen and Ian Holm, are masters. Their characters are not developed in dialogue, but by acting. Elijah Wood is almost there. None of the others comes close, although Liv Tyler didn't seem too bad (her character was too small here to judge well). It's also true that none of the situations were at all well developed. The whole film feels rushed, which we might expect in a movie based on a long novel. That still isn't forgivable. A lot of references get thrown out in the air with little explanation, and I heard several groups of viewers talking amongst themselves to see what was going on. But that's not all. There's plenty to criticize elsewhere as well. The story itself is lame. Let me guess: another uber-evil villain wants to control the world. How uninteresting can you get? I guess these novels may have started that trend, although I doubt that. Still, it was lame when Tolkien invented it and it's still lame in fantasy novels today. Then there's the cinematography: it's repetitive. The novel's structure is basically one of an endless parade of locales, and the basic shot is an aerial view of the umpteen good guys walking in a straight line across whatever locale they've reached. Peter Jackson must have spent at least half of the 16 months it took to make these three films sitting in a helicopter! Also, the battle scenes are ridiculous. Anyone who complains when the rebels live in the battle scenes in Star Wars, or how the Storm Troopers always miss is going to laugh themselves silly when they see these nine fellows, four of whom barely fight (the hobbits), dispatch hundreds of drooling orcs in a matter of ten minutes. So what did I like? Well, some of the action sequences are awfully entertaining, despite their ludicrousness. I especially like the special effects of the troll, and his fight with the group. That was very exciting. To further criticize the poor structure, I felt that the Balrog sequence was quite boring after that. It looked far too much like the devil from Fantasia's Night on Bald Mountain number. The Balrog in the Ralph Bakshi cartoon looked much cooler, actually. The showdown between Balrog and Gandolf was rather lame considering. I also liked the lovingly created and detailed locales, except for the Shire, which is boring. But most of everything else was great. The Ring Wraiths were pretty cool. I especially liked the way everything looked when Frodo puts on the ring. Other than those scant things, this was a huge disappointment considering the recent imdb fiasco. This truly is a blight on our great site. Embarrassing to the highest degree. 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0120737

"When I first saw it back in '05 I was fairly unimpressed. Didn't feel like Batman. Sure it was better than the Schumacher nonsense. Heck, even better than Burton's stuff. But it just didn't feel like Batman. I might have given it a 6/10 at the time. But this time I liked it much more. Maybe I needed to get into the groove of this new Nolan direction. But actually the stuff I liked the most was Bruce's journey. Not so much the superhero stuff. Loved it when he gets back to Gotham and starts putting his new secret identity/new life into motion. And I loved his scenes with Morgan Freeman and the unveiling of the Tumbler Batmobile. Sweet ride! I think the movie gets a bit too hectic and cluttered for its own good towards the end with all the pyrotechnics and madness in the streets but it's the smaller and more personal moments that really drive this movie. Or when Batman does something really wicked cool! Of course Liam Neeson as always is great.",neutral,6,tt0372784
"By far, I think Martin Scorsese is my favourite film director. He has a solid film resume under his belt, and despite losing all five of his Best Director Oscar nominations, continues to pump out movies. When his movies are good, they are usually absolutely fantastic. When his movies are bad, even then they still have some form of redeeming quality saving it from full ostracizing. And while I was a bit apprehensive about him doing a remake of the Asian film Infernal Affairs, I have now realized that I was wrong. The Departed brings Scorsese back to his roots on the mean streets, and back to what he does best. The Departed (named after what people are commonly referred to after passing on) chronicles the stories of two Boston police officers, both involved in the continued case to apprehend infamous mobster, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). One is Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), a kid with a not-so-great family history who goes undercover within Costello's group soon after graduation. The other, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), is a member of Costello's group undercover within the police department, quickly moving up the ranks. Costigan and Sullivan do not know each other, but as the film heats up, both began seeking out the other. The film is just about phenomenal. I went in with high expectations, and came out totally and utterly impressed. I refused to watch Affairs on principle of being so hyped for this film, and to a point, I think this helped. I knew some basic outlines and ideas of what happened in the original version, but as they played out on screen here, they look just as astonishing as I could imagine. The film is downright intense during many sequences. The cinematography and editing is seamless and absolutely awestriking. There were a few obvious nodes to his older works, but for the most part, is generally what we have come to expect from Scorsese and his films. As well, the writing is sharp and extremely strong. You may find yourself laughing hysterically at a few of the things people say, but you will also sit in fear of these people. Everyone here is a bad, yet highly realistic person. So when one of these characters makes some great jokes, you will be conflicted as to the proper reaction to give. I had no problem with Gangs of New York or The Aviator, but you could tell that Scorsese was having a bit of trouble with the ambitious projects. Seeing him here, back in the same style of film as the likes of Goodfellas and Mean Streets, just brought a smile to my face after watching the entire film. You can tell the precise touches of a Scorsese film from miles away, and this film is no exception. He brings a fine art out of these dark streets like no one else can. And of course, he has the most perfect music selection of any Hollywood director currently alive and employed. He uses them to make his undeniably brilliant and memorable moments all that much better, and as per always, he succeeds. DiCaprio and Damon are excellent in their roles (albeit it took a little bit before I was very trusting of either of their accents). Their slow deterioration and the fear slowly creeping in on them is an absolutely pleasure to watch. While DiCaprio gets a lot more screen time and is fleshed out more, Damon is definitely the better actor, and had the better performance. These two are believable and frightening all at once. As the film keeps moving and you get more of a sense of who these guys really are, these feelings only continue to progress. Nicholson is in top form here. He chews up scenery left and right, and practically steals the carpet right out from the other two. While I saw shades of The Joker in his performance, this is still one of those essentially totally evil acting roles. You cannot help but be scared by this guy, and seeing such a masterful actor in such a great director's hands, is just too memorable of an idea to miss. The supporting cast, which includes Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, Ray Winstone, Anthony Anderson and Vera Farmiga are all superb in their small roles. None of them can even hold a candle to the other three, but their valiant try cannot go unrewarded. Farmiga and Wahlberg are particular standouts, which didn't not surprise me at all granted his newer material. They are a strong ensemble, and they bring out the great movie watching style even more. If there were anything wrong with the film, it would be the pace of it all. Everyone is on the ball (even through blood-saturated death sequences), but the editing is not completely. At some points, particularly the first hour and the last thirty minutes, the film just whizzes right by. But in others, the film just slows right down. It makes the film feel totally uneven. Some exposition scenes just go a bit too long, and others are just straight and right to the point. I know that the film relies on all the exposition (and the graphic violence, which never lets up), but some of it just felt forced and a bit awkward. They make the film seem a whole lot longer than it really is. It is only a small quibble in an otherwise fantastic film, but still worthy of mention. On the whole, The Departed is one hell of a movie. Packed with strong performances and a great story, this is another excellent addition to the ever-growing cannon of Scorsese films. It obviously is not as good as some of those films, but it makes an astonishing contribution to the library. I can only hope it is recognized at Oscar time for how memorable a film it is. 9.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0407887

"The Snowman (2017) is a just such a mess in a lot of ways. The first problem that this film faces is not being able to hold the audiences attention. My attention really started to stray and I started to check my phone and see how much longer it had just within the first half hour. The plot is the second issue, I feel like there was some real potential here, it could've been intriguing and the plot could and should have been executed in a much more coherent fashion. They would introduce certain characters that I didn't fully understand why they were even in the film at all. And they would have short scenes that tried to explain some things but to be honest, the film was so all over the place and hard to follow that I just didn't care. The characters weren't given very much depth either, one character is kinda given a backstory but that's it. Also, the final scene is soooo dumb, something happens that i just cringed at, it was a ""seriously?"" kind of moment. This film is just all over the place and I left it thinking: ""well that just didn't make much sense"".

"OK comedy/drama telling the story of young con man DiCaprio, chased by Hanks' FBI man. The opening credits and score set the tone for this retro looking film. Overall, it has an air of being old-school. It's not very dark or foul mouthed, and it's not a pure comedy either. It has a nostalgic touch to it, which I guess is supposed to draw in the crowds for an old fashioned crime caper of sorts. However, I thought the film felt kind of schizophrenic. The comedy bits are those that work best (Hanks' best work so far in my opinion), but judging from the subject matter, this should have been a considerably darker film in tone. It's like Spielberg didn't know how to put the story together as it displays numerous mood swings - sometimes serious, sometimes definitely not. Structrually, the film also feels a bit weak, it would have worked better with linear storytelling, rather than jumping back and forth in time. The acting is OK, but I could never really get to grips with DiCaprio's character (and in some scenes, neither did DiCaprio). The production design, cinematography, and score work fine together but the story never quite holds up. There is nothing remarkable about the film, and towards the end, Spielberg's sappier movie sentiments makes for some not so good movie time, unfortunately. [6/10]",neutral,6,tt0264464

"This can't get any worse. After seeing LOTR I and enjoying it immensely, I was eager to watch the sequel. Unfortunately, the movie does not live up to my expectations for hundreds of reasons. 1. Too many in-battle humorous(?) one-liners. The dwarf is a Rambo wannabe 2. Horrible acting with the exception of 2-3 characters 3. A Golum (forget the spelling) with clear sexual abuse problems during its childhood. Do we really care so much about the Golum? 4. Little annoying speeches about the ecological disasters involved. Is this a green party brochure? This is Good vs Evil. Who cares about the trees cut down? 5. Too many characters so the film emphasizes on none of them. The end result? The viewer does not really care what happens in the last battle. Personally, I really wanted the Uruk-hai (or whatever) warriors to completely destroy the castle. It is a typical silvester-tweety (again sorry if the spelling is not correct) situation. Why the cat can't eat the damn bird is beyond me. 6. Hundreds of logical holes (I have not read the book and don't plan to). Sharuman is inside the king, controlling him. So why the need for the ""advisor"" (one of the best characters portrayed)? And why don't they cut his head when they have the chance? Who would really spare his life? And what are the defenses (catapults etc) of the castle? And last but not least, the editing is absolutely horrible. It's just a sequence of cut-out scenes that do not make any sence. Anyway, 3/10 for the soundtrack, make-up, graphics and scenery alone.

"Filmed over 30 years ago, i believe that The Godfather to this day, is simply the best movie ever made. To be honest, i think that before they make another movie this good, particularly in this genre, we will be watching it with our children's children...if we're lucky. I had to watch The Godfather more than once to realise that this movie is actually more about family than the mafia or the underworld. Most of the vengeance and deaths in this movie are not caused by money or greed. They are for family. I must say i haven't seen a movie before that gives this much importance to family. Particularly Al Pacino's character - Michael does an unbelievable turn around when it comes to his family. It's just incredible. At first reluctant to get involved with the family business, Michael soon becomes more ambitious and tougher than everyone else, again only for his family. The fact that this movie is non cliché makes it more enjoyable to watch. It's not predictable in a sense where the good guy wins and bad guy loses eventually. It's so much more realistic than that. I have nothing bad to say about the length, editing and definitely about the cast. Al Pacino especially just continues to surprise me with how good he portrays his character. He is no doubt the best actor in Hollywood. Some people may find The Godfather very slow, dark and depressing. It's not the loudest and most 'vibrant' movie, but that's kind of the whole point. I believe those people should then stop watching movies from this genre, because if you did not like this one...you won't like any.

"The only redeeming quality of ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" is not being as awful as ""The Last Jedi"" was or as mind-numbingly boring and flat as ""The Force Awakens"". But then, it's all downhill from there. The movie is a hodgepodge mess of mediocre proportions in so far as casting, acting, characters and character development, direction, screenwriting, shoddy special effects, and at times murky cinematography. Alden Ehrenreich was a poor choice for the role of Han, he was quite unremarkable and bland, and worse more often than not during the movie he kind of faded into the background, not something you want to see from your leading actor. As for Donald Glover he seemed actually quite underwhelming as Lando, though in all fairness he didn't have much to do on-screen. Woody Harrelson and Paul Bethany were by far the most interesting characters and strongest performers, as much as that can be said in a movie like ""Solo"", yet their talents seemed quite wasted. Emilia Clarke was good as Q'ira, but her character wasn't given much depth and served mostly as window dressing for large parts of the movie. Chewie was Chewie, though after the whole porgs set-up from ""The Last Jedi"", they tried to make him fiercer with mixed results. Thandie Newton and the new character Rio were completely wasted as well. As for L3, well let's say, that character makes Jar Jar Binks tolerable... Despite an adequate soundtrack/score (which was weirdly undermined by the always hovering presence of John Williams who basically tied John Powell's hands behind his back.) and some decently arranged actions set pieces, the movie meanders, sputters and at times stops through bad pacing and quite often choppy editing. What also becomes apparent when watching, are the two different movies fighting to jump off of screen. That is exactly one of the prominent weaknesses of ""Solo A Star Wars Story"". When Phil Lord and Chris Miller were fired, they had almost completed shooting the movie. Ron Howard was brought in to save the project. Rumour has it that he had to re-shoot almost seventy percent of it. However while watching ""Solo"", it seems as if the damage inflicted by Lord and Miller was too deep and Ron Howard couldn't or did not have the ability or vision, to put this cinematic mess back together and at the very least deliver a decent picture. I wonder, had Disney/Lucasfilm pushed the release date back to sometime in December (2018) and allowed Ron Howard to re-shoot the entire movie, if the end result would have been any better?! For my money there is no better origins story for one of the most beloved ""Star Wars"" characters like Han Solo, than the ""The Han Solo"" trilogy of novels by AC Crispin. Maybe if Disney/Lucasfilm hadn't jettisoned the Expanded Universe, sorry Legends, maybe they could have used those novels as their source material for the movie... 5/10",neutral,5,tt3778644

Even though I'm very poor with my free time and choosing what to spend it on, I couldn't resist my curiosity. I watched it, it's bad, very bad, but nowhere near the worst. I've seen a couple of thousand movies and some were quite worse than this one. Basically, the idea and the script aren't that bad at all, the problem is that it was shot totally amateurishly, with an obviously ridiculous budget and equipment, by people who barely knew what they were doing. It's as if someone without any film experience filmed a home movie for the fun of it. It could pass as the first attempt at a feature film by first-year students, but mostly it looks to me like a recording of a theatrical performance of some amateur theater. Seen from the latter perspective, it is not so catastrophically bad. I wouldn't even rule out the possibility that it was done that way on purpose, because at times it has a vibe of a misunderstood art. All in all, ""Manos"" is a very bad movie, but it's not bad enough to deserve the cult status of the worst, nor is it bad in the way that some movies turn the game around and fall into the ""so bad it's good"" category. Any way you look at it, it's a waste of time. 3/10.",negative,3,tt0060666
"The Fast and the Furious has very little going for it, unless you love cars. If you love cars, perhaps you should consider going to a car show. The plot? Point Break with less surfing and more drag racing. It drags (no pun intended) like hell if you're not into that sort of thing. Vin Diesel is irritating, Paul Walker is Paul Walker in tough-but-nice-guy mode. He's competent enough. The movie was shot like a car commercial, in style as well as substance. The races were okay, the dialogue was stupid (""I live life a quarter mile at a time!"") and if they wanted to cater to horny guys, they really should have aimed for a higher rating. That would have made it at least a little more interesting for me. I have very little to say on this movie. I hated it, and thought it had no substance whatsoever. But if you're into that sort of thing (and the numbers continue to grow) go for it. 2/10.",negative,2,tt0232500

"This is it, I have always been so careful on not getting carried away while watching great films and calling it the best. I am talking about the league of The Godfather, Casablanca, The Good The Bad & The Ugly and 12 Angry Men. So I always called each of them one of the best. I never believed THE BEST ever existed. It can't be, right? How can anything be the best or perfect. Definitely not perfect film. There's got to be something wrong somewhere I just need to look close enough. But I was wrong. Although I knew I was all the way. Right from the very first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption on HBO in 1997 (18 years ago) and I waited 18 years, 5 thorough viewings, 1 sceptical review before I wrote my final judgment of this film. This is the best film ever made. Spotless. True classic. And it was not even directed or acted by the legends we know today. Sure they are true legends. But what Frank Dorabont, Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman & their amazing crew did is something extra special. They created the best work on cinema ever with almost none of those legends working on them. This film needs no further description. Ten out of ten in every department of film making. Full of incredible moments. Beauty, class and intellect in almost every scene. You do not need to know the No.1 film status on IMDb for over a decade to actually believe in the power of this genius work of art. This is the best, if there is one. This is the film that reaffirmed my faith in hope, human perseverance and friendship. I'm sure there are many who believe this isn't that great, but I am glad I think otherwise - and believe me, its a great feeling. Of having found the best film, being a huge film lover. 10/10 - the only time I ever did or would do this on IMDb or elsewhere.",positive,10,tt0111161

"This movie is basically about two guys going around blowing stuff up in Paris. And the plot of them trying to take down a terrorist organization is just there to move the movie along because, even for films like this there has to be some sort of plot. And everything in this is nothing you haven't seen before with the explosions and gun fights and all, but something about the film just makes it pretty damn entertaining. I mean the plot with the by the book dude teaming up with a loose cannon crazy guy has been done before, but the elements of bad ass and witty and fast paced dialogue and maybe some other stuff makes it really entertaining to watch, even if the twist near the end was pretty predictable as the rest of the movie. Jonathan Rhys Meyers who plays a character that plays by the book was pretty boring and he takes up the first few couple of minutes of the movie, but when John Travolta comes in, well lets just say it's one hell of a ride. He basically plays Charlie Wax, a reckless guy that is a bit crazy but always gets things done.

"People had told me two things about this movie. First, that it was difficult to understand. It isn't. The plot is very simple and understandable. Second, that this was a great movie. It isn't. The plot is so understandable that it's boring. Almost everything in this movie is a rehash of science fiction themes that have come up over and over again. It's somewhere around the year 2199. We know that because Morpheus (played - well played I concede - by Lawrence Fishburne) tells us. Machines have conquered humanity and taken over. OK. I can think of at least one original Star Trek episode and the entire series Battlestar Galactica that revolved around that. The whole thing takes place inside a series of computer programs. OK. The holodeck on the Starship Enterprise, or any number of movies about Virtual Reality spring to mind. One person (Neo, played by Keanu Reeves) will save the world. Hmmm. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home: ""Captain Kirk, you and your crew have saved this planet."" In short, there just isn't anything original in this story. How it makes it to #31 on the all time list (at the time of writing) is beyond me. There are some good things in this movie. There must have been a massive special effects budget, because the special effects are superb. No argument there. But great special effects - and even some good performances by Fishburne and Reeves (and a drily humorous performance by Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith) don't make up for the basic weakness of this entirely unoriginal story. 2/10 - solely for the special effects.",negative,2,tt0133093
"Ok, there are a ton of user reviews on here and everyone pretty much already established as to why this film is so incredible. That is undebatable at this point as far as I'm concerned. So, I'll just keep this short and to the point. Yes, it IS as amazing as people say. Is it a tad bit over rated? Yes, perhaps. This is in no way, shape or form the greatest film ever created. If someone told me The Godfather was, I'd agree with them more on that. Both wouldn't even make my top 10 or top 20....there are just too many extraordinary films out there. My personal #1 will forever be Dances with Wolves...now THAT is a true human and well told story in my eyes that in no way gets the props it deserves on here. But anyway....here's my main beef. If this movie IS indeed as well loved as it is today, then where are all of you supporting it? It has by far the most user ratings on here yet outside of this website the film is nowhere near a success. Now, I get it why it didn't do well at the box office (it flopped). It was a difficult film to market. Everyone just somehow overlooked it - heck, I didn't even watch this film for the first time until just 3 years ago - but then why did it also fail on home video? It's nowhere near one of the best selling films. Usually you show your love for a film by supporting it and owning it. Both Avatar and Titanic are two of the biggest selling (non animated films) of all time. I bet some of these same people who bought these films prefer Shawshank even, but didn't go out and buy it. And something like this I find upsetting. I don't think the close to 3M people on here even own the movie at all yet they claim it is the greatest they have ever seen. I just don't understand why a film everyone praises so much isn't supported. Go right now and buy it on DVD or bluray. Heck, I did and it's not even in my top 20. Maybe top 30, somewhere...but it still deserves a 10/10 from me and I'm just such film viewer with such varied tastes.

"the movie started very well, in a very original way, but the very moment the girl made her entrance into the movie, I understood that I fell into a trap: her appearance as a mix of Patsy Kensit and Beetlejuice, which should represent some sort of troubled woman - troubled by an unclear kind of trouble she seems to have - is where the movie immediately starts to turn into a boring repetition of a ""look, this man was living a senseless life and will find his real nature by beating the hell out of people"". in general, the whole movie seems to travel on a path between ""troubled people are cool"" and ""oh, look at the poor middle class worker turning into a cool beating machine"". then, a couple of stupid plot twists, and some hundreds of scenes which require an abundant dose of suspension of disbelief, turn the movie into what seems to be the movie reduction of some comics for troubled teenagers (and pardon my ignorance if it actually is, but I'm not and never been into such kind of comics). I'm 39, and I have watched the movie on year 2016, so I have probably missed the right time to watch it on target (I believe the target is about 30 years old), but I don't really think I could have personally enjoyed the movie at any age. i understand the movie is trying to tell you something beyond what you actually see: yes, I have the minimum IQ required to understand this (which is about 60, I believe); it's just that the ""wake up and make your dreams real"" motto which is behind the movie just doesn't catch me, especially if it is told for 130 minutes *AND* in a stupid way. yes, this movie seems to fascinate lots of people, while harassing a strict minority; I'm clearly part of the second area. I'm not giving 1/10 to this movie like many others, as it would be unfair, but honestly I can't give it more than 4. my hint is: if when you see the girl coming into the screen your bad-movie-sense tickles you, then do yourself a favour and turn the thing off",negative,1,tt0137523

When I left the cinema the first time, I was in tears, I walked home and was still in tears about 30 mins later at home, blubbing to my wife, who couldn't understand what had happened to me because I couldn't even speak properly.
That's how strongly the movie affected me. I am in tears now, having watched it again. I love space movies, post apocalyptic movies, Christopher Nolan movies, so I was probably going to enjoy it but I can assure you I have never come out of the cinema with even a twitch in my eye after any other such movies.
Feeling tearful if googled ""interstellar makes"" and it filled in ""...me cry"" so I'm not the only one.
I see some people didn't enjoy it (1/10 seems a bit extreme but each to their own), I wonder if it meant more to me because I am a father of a girl? It would be good to hear from others who felt strongly either way but we can't discuss on IMDb anymore since the forums were taken down.

"Critically acclaimed for it's unflinching look at the Mafia world, The Godfather Part I took him three academy awards: Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted screenplay. Marlon Brando (in his Oscar winning role) as Vito leads a powerful cast, who all do superbly in their roles. Al Pacino and James Cann provide excellent support as two of Vito's sons, and honorable mentions are Sterling Hayden and Robert Duvall. Francis Ford Coppola's powerful direction really flushes out everything in this film. Instead of telling the viewer what to feel about the characters, he lets them rather get involved in the storyline. The script too is amazing, detailing very particular things about the life of the Mafia, and also showing how corruption can even get to the nicest of people. The photography is very 70's style and shows the era the film takes place in very well. It's also noteworthy that this film started about every cliche in mafia films today. Whether it is lines such as ""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."" or just the assassination scenes, it all came from this film. It's a startling and bold achievment in filmaking, but Coppola could have also made the connections between certain characters a bit more apparent. Best film of all time?

Acting: None of the actors have a nice performance, and they tried to put some conflicts with people, it is something like : ""I don't like you"" all of sudden.It just doesn't work. The Cars: Although the car sequences may seem a bit ""cool"" it has several flaws, and you don't need to pay so MUCH attention to see it. Again they think we are dumb enough to don't realize it. THE MOVIE: I don't even know if i can call it a movie, when i finished watching it, all i could remember were cars, and hot women, and cars and women and some cars with women. Is this really a movie?

"If you watch The Fast and the Furious for the script and the acting, you will be disappointed. This movie has no intention of being a Michael Mann-like philosophical action movie. It's just a silly ride that will entertain for a couple of hours without any real emotional impact on the viewer. I knew this right from the start, which is why I enjoyed The Fast and the Furious. Actually, I'm being a bit unfair, since there is one respectable performance in the film: Vin Diesel's career-making portrayal of Dominic Toretto, who is the undisputed king of L.A.'s illegal street racing. That is, until a cocky guy named Brian (Paul Walker) shows up to challenge him. Naturally, Dom wins, but in the meantime he's made friends with the newcomer, who saves his life when the cops show up. As we learn soon after-wards, though, it's all a set-up: Brian is a cop himself, going undercover to find out whether Dom is involved in a series of truck hijackings. In the hands of a better director, the movie could have been an interesting character study, with the addition of a few mandatory action sequences. Rob Cohen, however, treats the script like an excuse to stage a bunch of visually spectacular race scenes. Those scenes, as well as Diesel's charismatic presence, make The Fast and the Furious fun enough to watch, but not good enough to remember. In fact, there aren't enough elements to justify the film's transformation into a franchise. But focusing on these aspects is pointless: just take the movie for what it is (a good-looking, if shallow summer blockbuster) and enjoy it. Otherwise, watch something better. 7,5/10",neutral,5,tt0232500

Granted, Dr. Hannibal Lecter doesn't have a lot of screentime, but it's mysterious enough to satisfy the viewer. I admit it. He's a unique, scary psychopath who in a bit funny and certainly unforgettable. Kudos to Hopkins for a wonderful performance. As for the story, despite its great character, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991) is neither original nor unexpected. It's a normal thriller with mysterious eldritch characters and a villain who is played so perfectly that the film has become a classic thanks to him. Well, yes, but that's not enough for me. I liked the movie, but that's it. To be honest, apart from Hannibal, nothing else in the film particularly impressed me. Even the moments where the villain was missing were boring to me and overall the whole investigation story seemed monotonous, boring, predictable and redundant.

"In the Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze movie 'Point Break', A young cop goes undercover as the member of a team in order to root out some crims and things escalate when they move on the wrong gang and start to realise that the offenders are closer to home than realised. It comes down to a choice between loyalty to his cause or to his friendship. In this flashy, loud and heavy petrol head flick it is no different, infact there are more similarities between them than just in the basics. It is a step by step re-hash. If there was to be between them a re-watch choice it would be this one over and over again though. It is gripping, with solid performances and a unique and impressive look. This movie is easily the best car flick yet. A veteran of Pitch Black, Vin Deisel I would say is headed for action stardom. He's a similar character in both but it doesn't matter. Pitch black is an under-rated gem and this by legitimate critics reviews is a worthily rated gem. I think they deserve Sound Design and Cinematography oscar nominations for it, the Limp Bizkit overtures are the only thing really that could do them out of it, they have the worst rep on the globe which is why they are so successfull, the oldies who vote for the academy would hate that.

I found it fairly shocking that people had decided to rate this film 1/10 and other equally low ratings. Sure, you can compare this film to Kubrick's work if you like, but how is this film anything like what he's ever done? It's not. I think a lot of people like to think they 'know film', but really they're just sheep. Hear how they harp on about very popular 'masters of film' such as Kubrick and Hitchcock, and don't get me wrong I loved The Shining, 2001 was a bit boring really wasn't it unless you were born in the 60s seeing it on acid, rear window was cool as was south by south west.. but wait, this film had awesome action and AN AWESOME PLOT. If you like a good story, then go see this film. If you're more interested in how well somebody is acting, what 'the director was thinking' etc.. go see something else and really have a think about why you watch films in the first place. I was tempted to give this a 10/10 to offset the stupid hateful reviews a bit but I resisted. I also started thinking about how IMDb should re- think it's rating system.

Yes, that's right, not since 1999, not since, dare I say it, ""Star Wars - Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace"". And I've only been waiting for this movie for a little over a year! All I have to say is the following; Interstellar was an incoherent, implausible, unscientific, misandrist mess. *** SPOILERS BEGIN HERE *** 1. The protagonist in this film, Cooper, is denied the prize of his journey and sacrifice only to give it to the female characters of the movie. His daughter inherits the knowledge of both her father and Caine's scientist character and mysteriously solves the gravity equation which inexplicably saves the world. Anne Hathaway's character is saved by Cooper's sacrifice so she can become some galactic 'Eve' on a new planet. Ridiculous. What is she going to do, make an appointment at the IVF clinic on planet X? Is she going to give birth to ten daughters and artificially inseminate them in turn? Nonsense. 2. The antagonist, Matt Damon's character, is nothing but a caricatured villain whose motivations are never explained. He is shown as being weak and a coward. No one with these qualities would ever volunteer for a mission like this or last this long on a desert planet without killing themselves. They even called him Dr. Mann which makes him come across as representing all men as weak and evil. Ugh! 3. The old and wise scientist turns out to be a liar. Michael Caine's character is shown to have duped everyone on the mission because he knew somehow that plan A would never work? He's just and @#$#? WTF! 4. The brother, who for some reason Cooper doesn't give two @#$% about turns into an insane madman. 5. The mission which takes them on a journey for thousands of light years of space travel only to circle back to a little girl's bedroom to show that a girl's intuition and love trumps science on any day of the week! Absolute nonsense!!! THE ONLY MEN IN THIS MOVIE THAT ARE GIVEN ANY REDEEMING QUALITIES IS THE BLACK MAN AND THE ROBOT. Mr. Nolan, and I'm sure you read this garbage, please take this advice for your next film: You don't need to water down your male heroes with emotional drivel and juvenile female sentiment to get women to watch your movies. You did this in Inception and TDKR when you jammed in Marion Cotillard's awful emotional subplots into an otherwise brilliant story. Take the example of 2010: Odyssey Two. A forgotten sci-fi gem of the eighties. This movie had a very strong female lead played brilliantly by Hellen Mirren. Her character was most believable because she was in balance with her equally strong, intelligent male counterparts which included Roy Scheider and John Lithgow (anyone catch the hot dog reference?). If you modeled this movie after 2010 instead of 2001, I think you could have reached your biggest audience. Unfortunately, I will not be part of this one. I gave this movie two stars for some original ideas the movie tried to do. The story, the score and some god-awful performance by Matt Damon made it impossible to keep this movie together.

Fight Club is about an office slave insomniac who is living in a world of IKEA furniture catalogs and Starbucks.  And the only way, he found out, to relieve his insomnia is to go to retreat groups for patients of terminal diseases such as Testicular Cancer, Tuberculosis, Parasites, and more. That's where he meets Marla Singer who is a chain smoking woman who like Norton is faking his diseases to go to groups.  He is then interupted and cannot go to sleep.  He then meets another person, Tyler Durden which h meets on an airplane.  I'm not telling you the rest.  Count on me, this is a great film.  This is also an example of a College Poster Movie(a movie's poster is on a college frat, dorm, etc.)  It's really bad a**. 9/10",positive,9,tt0137523
"Boy did I have high expectations going into this movie. After making two of my all time favorite films, Insomnia, and Memento, and making a solid debut film in, Following, I thought Christopher Nolan could do no wrong. And while this film isn't exactly wrong, it just isn't better than Tim Burton's Batman. Hell, in my opinion it's a little worse than Batman Forever. What problems do I have with the film? For one thing Christian Bale. I always cringe when I see a graduate of the Keanu Reeves school of acting, and Bales deep monotone whisper did just this. For god sakes show some emotion! Guy Ritchie was able to pull that style of acting off in one of Nolans previous films, Memento, but in this it just doesn't work for Bale. Getting back to Nolan, it's hard to smell his stench in the movie. The beginning of the film is evident with his type of dialouge and dark artsy cinematography, but as the film goes on, you forget it's Nolan's, and it will remind you more of David S. Goyer's (the co-writer) Blade films. The second half of the movie is filled with little dialouge, and because of this the film just drags on to its way too long 2 hour and 20 minute end. And whats with all the one liners? It seems that Nolan and Goyer stuff the film with way too many inappropriate for the time jokes. But my biggest pet peeve with the movie was the score. It wasn't as much that it didn't hold a candle to Danny Elfman's classic Batman score, but more that I could not recall ONE time that it wasn't playing in the background. On the plus side, Katie Holmes does a good job as the love interest, and Michael Caine is great as Alfred. Gary Oldman also gives a fine performance. I could however do without Morgan Freeman's character who is basically to Batman exactly what Q is to James Bond. While the premise of the film about Bruces fear of bats was excellent, the rest of it just doesn't work as well as it worked for Burton (and even Schumaker in 'Returns) if you are more of a Batman fan than a Nolan fan, you'll probably enjoy the film a lot more than I did. 6/10",neutral,6,tt0372784
"This movie is terrific as is, easily the best film of last year. Unfortunately, once something becomes popular(Harry Potter, Titanic,etc), it seems to bring out all the idiots who love to put down everything popular. Peter Jackson's vision of Middle Earth is amazing and I'm sure it will become even more fleshed out with the release of the extended version of the film. One of my only gripes with the film was that Lothlorien was totally butchered and Galadriel comes off as more of a wicked witch than a kinder Queen of the Elves. Fortunately that will be fixed with the extended version also. The problems that some people have with the movie are warranted except that this is essentially just 1/3 of a movie. Star Wars suffered from the same problem initially-no character depth, a boring beginning, then non-stop fighting late in the movie. Then the characters and story became more fleshed out with the release of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. In time, I'm predicting The Lord of the Rings trilogy will stand side-by-side with the Original Star Wars trilogy. 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0120737
"I am going to say straight away I am not a die hard Marval fan as it all seems a touch far fetched for me, but having said I did enjoy the last avengers film and most recent Spiderman.
However this, although not a terrible watch was as if they had given the film makers unlimited access to budget and special effects. And the result was as if every instrument in an orchestra was all playing very loudly and all at the same time.
Parts felt like I was just watching a computer game and the cgi, and there was a lot of it didn't feel as good as in others. 
That being said there were more funny parts in this film compared to the others, but was I left thinking about it the next day? No. Would I watch it again? Not unless somebody else asked/forced me to.
So overall 6 but more like a high end 5/10 than a solid 6 and I was glad my ticket price was reduced due to an offer.",neutral,5,tt4154756

"Its too bad this film has such a loyal fanbase right now, because it is a complete waste of time and film.  This film was made to appeal to the Academy, but actually had nothing special in it except for maybe its budget. Russell Crowe is terrible, and I don't know when everyone will realize it. He can play one character and one character only, that being the smart-alec dead-pan monotone type.  I liked him in The Insider because that was the first movie I saw him in.  His acting style suited the part very well.  Then I saw Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind and realized how bad he actually is. His characters are all the same and never allow the audience to see any emotion, and don't allow us to buy into his characters' motivations. Russell Crowe wasn't the only terrible one however.  I don't think a single character was likable or even remotely interesting.  This film is just another example of a good plot that was ruined by the actors and director. Its too bad the Academy only focuses on domestic gross and a movie's ability to look ""cool"".  Only redeeming factor in this movie was that it could hold the viewer's attention, thus I give it a 3/10",negative,3,tt0172495

"I have to say I'm quite surprised that TDK has such a good rating here on IMDb. This movie is, without a shadow of doubt, the best superhero movie ever (at the moment), I don't think there's much discussion here, but let's face it, the standard superhero movie is a 2/10. I can understand why the masses like this movie so much, batman is a well known superhero, there's action, explosions, the plot is easy to follow, there's a love story, all the clichés. But that's exactly why the movie is just a cool summer movie, and not the best movie ever. The plot is minimalist and usually wanders off in useless sub-plots that bring nothing to the movie. Except from Ledger (that was outstanding), all the actors are mediocre to say the best. The lines they make these actors say are the final nail in the coffin, the dialogs sound fake and sometimes ridiculous, the pseudo philosophy someone tried to put in the movie is just sad to hear. In the end there's nothing I learned from watching this movie, there's nothing new in there. After all it's a decent movie to watch, but you cannot compare it to great classics, whoever thinks this is the best movie ever should really watch more cinema or maybe get a brain.",negative,2,tt0468569
"I was minding my own business, trying to fill a quota of things to watch when Netflix suggested this movie. I figured, ""ooh, a scary movie on a Saturday night, starring Dylan Minette (13 Reasons Why), 'Don't Breathe' was good, let's go!"" The trailer says, ""You can't lock out what's already inside."" Maybe we'll get lucky and this will be sort of like the iconic 'Scream' franchise. We follow Logan and his mother as they are forced to move to his aunt's big house in a very secluded location. The only catch is they have to leave for the most part of every Sunday because there's an open house where potential buyers come in and out inspecting the place. Big house, out every Sunday, seems harmless enough, right? When they get back, strange things start to happen like doors closing, things getting moved, and noises from places where there shouldn't be. At this point, everyone becomes a suspect, the kooky neighbor, the over-friendly store attendant, the plumber, the cops, and even Logan himself. Halfway through the movie I confidently said I've got the invader figured out and was just riding it out until the movie ends.
Boy was I wrong. I won't spoil it for you but you have to wait until the end credits to figure out who the invader is. Like literally, you have to read the cast credits. Then it's up to you as to how you will react. A Forbes review got pissed off, it has a 3.2/10 rating in IMDB, while I just laughed and figured to just charge it to Netflix's aggressive expansion for content in 2017-18 (see The Ritual, 1922, Gerald's Game and Hush.)

The dude who plays Han Solo did really well at his part and he did a great/ almost perfect representation of Han Solo and what he would be like if he was young

"The entire story was told from the Henry's perspective, I mean what he sees through his eyes are the visuals we get. The first person point of view. Like the video games, but you won't play, just sit back and watch it. So you won't see the Henry's face, because he's you and you won't utter a word. That character was actually performed by many stuntmen and their risky stunt sequences pay off so well. That means, the main character is the cinematographer of the film. So all the credit must go to them for doing multiple task at a same time. It is a one day event based narration. All about running and chasing, right from the beginning. Along the way it lets us know why it's taking place and who's behind it. The rest of the cast was too amazing, especially that South African actor of 'District 9' fame was simply brilliant with different getups. I also enjoyed the Russian locations which were something refreshing. The story was simple, but puzzled. They explained nearly everything, yet a few doubts remain with us. So I'm expecting a follow-up, more than that I want it to be a trilogy and nothing less. For the sequel, put us in the cinema hall, but give us Virtual Reality Headset, I think that's how the future of cinema should be, especially for this film. Very unique and craziest film, one of the best of this year. It was kind of similar to Statham's 'Crank', as well as good as that one. If you like action films, then surely you would love it. Especially if you're a gamer, then it will be a double treat. The Americans did not show interest in this like usual which is not Hollywood or British. Especially critics never appreciated the creativity, but this is a must see film and the rest of the world accepted the truth. So don't think of skipping it. 8.5/10",neutral,5,tt3072482

Maybe one day someone will rise to their level of talent but until then we have The Dark Knight to look back on. This movie is definitely a 10/10 and gives me the goose bumps when streamed on my TV. Too bad Heath Ledger passed away. His performance in The Dark Night has definitely hit the history books!",positive,10,tt0468569
"I couldn't believe that while watching Doom I actually found myself thinking, ""well, it's no Resident Evil."" Never a good sign. This is a bad movie! It's boring for one thing, and is generally uninteresting. Okay, we have some research facility...something goes wrong...there's a virus...there's monsters...soldiers come in...pointless action ensues. I really defy anyone to explain just what the hell is going on in Doom. It's one of those ""explain-as-you-go"" movies, where in between the action and gore, a scientist tells the characters (and the audience, of course) what is happening. It was in one ear and out the other for me. We've all seen umpteen movies like this. It didn't really remind me of the game at all (though I've only played 1 and 2) but I really think the game had a good look and feel and had potential. It would have been decent if they would have dropped the virus shtick and made the creatures demons from hell. And while they're at it, why not just skip the dull introduction of the soldiers getting the mission brief, which fills up 20 minutes, with another 20 minutes of walking around until something actually happens? Why not jump right into it, like the game does? That would be interesting, I think. I at least would never expect something like that. But, whatever, the movie is what it is. Which isn't good. I have to say though, it isn't completely hopeless. I thought the last 20 minutes or so was pretty good. We get that neat First Person Shooter sequence (that was one thing I'm glad the movie did), and a good fight scene, that even gets a tense build-up. I'll confess, when I saw that BFG (if you know the games or saw the movie you know what it stands for) I did get excited. Doom was not horrible, but it was just boring and by-the-numbers. I would probably even buy it one day on DVD if it finds its way to a bargain bin for $6.99. My rating: 4.5/10",neutral,5,tt0419706
"Yes, this movie is quite different. However, aside from the possibility that no one's done it before because they weren't smart/inspired/good enough to, there's also the other one.  This is a movie that fails so remarkably, you almost have to be a genius to come up with such a failure. In the one excellent scene in this movie, Edward Norton, flying on a plane from one of his constant business trips cracks a joke to his neighbour, Brad Pitt (aka Tyler Durden, here). ""very clever."" Pitt replies ""how is that going for you?"" That is both funny and poignant. The rest of the movie, however, is neither. In fact, it's just the same as poor Ed Norton - too clever for its own good. Worse yet is the reaction this movie seems to cause. Many of the others commented (and other people who've seen this movie) think that Tyler Durden is somehow the voice of good, a positive role model, if you will. And some people are completely nuts about this movie, they quote it day and night and I don't know, it's just weird. And then there's the ending. I can't give it away, but the best thing that I can say about it is that it is gimmicky. It's also pretty implausible, doesn't fit with the rest of the story and involves blowing up skyscrapers (something we now know is not a very good idea). If you're going to make a clever movie with a clever surprise ending, fine. It's possible to make a good one - The Usual Suspects for example. But having a clever movie that isn't clever enough to make sure the movie still makes any sense when the ending is revealed? A clever movie whose message is how empty cleverness is? A clever message movie? Where the message is delivered by someone who's obviously, shall we say, not very emotionally/mentally stable, to say the least? I guess you could say it's irony, but then with the same success you can say that ""Domestic Disturbance"" is a movie that makes one think 'cause it makes you think what the heck you're doing watching/paying for such an awful movie. Having said all that, this is a movie that could have been partially rescued by having a lead actress who is stunningly beautiful. Unfortunately, Helena Bonham Carter isn't. Okay, maybe it's not the most overrated movie on IMDb - after all ""The Shwshank Redemption"" is ranked #2 and ""Kingpin"" is not even on the bottom 100 at all. But it's pretty close. 1/10. And that high only cause it took so much effort.",negative,1,tt0137523
"Interstellar is what I would consider one of the most ambitious films within modern cinema, as well as one of the most thoroughly affecting; an emotional onslaught, contrasted with some of the greatest visuals ever put to screen. Whilst it doesn't match the brilliance and spectacle of some of Christopher Nolan's finest films, including Batman Begins, The Prestige, The Dark Knight and Inception, Interstellar comes dreadfully close to perfection, due to its glorious performances, brilliant sound design, immensely well-executed pacing, an emotional core that resonates with viewers of all ages, and a score from Hans Zimmer that reflects the emotion and wonder on screen with acute grandeur. The lead performance from Matthew McConaughey is something of wonder; a pitch-perfect performance from an exquisite actor. His chemistry with his co-stars is all fantastic, from Mackenzie Foy, who plays his daughter in the film, to Michael Caine, who plays the scientist and theorist Doctor Brand, to Anne Hathaway's powerful and resonant portrayal of a character often flawed, Brand. The movie encompasses both sentimental and scientific plots and ideas, metaphors and themes, and often executes them with a grace and harmony that is not so often found with modern sci-fi films; Interstellar proves that a film of immense scope can still suitably and aptly focus on the seemingly mundane relationship between father and daughter, but execute it with heart, soul and power, to both contrast as well as work together. The film encompasses a number of jaw-dropping moments, including a lift off sequence which I could call one of the most compelling and brilliantly shot sequences of film I've ever had the grace of viewing. The brilliant and loud sound design echoes throughout the cinema, shaking the seats and the viewers, and it allows the audience member to fully engross themselves in the current, dangerous predicament; it's thrilling and all encompassing viewing for all. As the visual effects break ground, McConaughey and Nolan remind us all that the true story that one should be enthralled within is that of the story between father and daughter, and that father's fight to not only get back to his daughter, but to save the human race from near-imminent extinction. The film also works to build themes around the idea of time; that time is not guaranteed, but a resource that is exhausted at a certain point. One must always be careful and moderate how they spend and use up their time, as it may run out far quicker than anyone could imagine. This is especially evident in scenes where Cooper and Brand are on planets in which a single hour spent examining and rummaging about on the surface translates to seven years of time gone by on Earth. Eventually, Cooper decides that it is best to conserve time, so that he may one day see his daughter again, but not all can go so swimmingly, or as well as he can hope. Interstellar is amassed of a number of spectacular plot twists, turning and shifting into all manner of areas, encompassing ideas and ambitions in a single cinematic fare only dreamt about before. The Nolan brothers are unafraid to spread their wings and invest their resources into the most far reaching of concepts; and whilst perhaps it doesn't always succeed, as is the case in the neatly packaged and partially unsatisfying final ten minutes of the picture, they mostly manage to triumph in their intentions. As is customary with Nolan pictures, many of the female characters have a few inexplicably poor one liners and exposition-like pieces of dialogue here and there, bringing us out of the film. Sometimes the story just plain doesn't make sense, and realism is sacrificed for ambition. But perhaps this is something to treasure; who cares if we don't have the most realistic of films, if what we get is something undeterred from going to wherever it sees fit and justified. Interstellar reminded me of why I go to the cinemas to firsthand witness films on the big screen; it gave me an experience which I cried in, was enthralled by, and ultimately, was stunned by all throughout. A brilliant cinematic achievement. 9.4/10 This was a brief summary of my thoughts. Check out my elongated review on www.entjunkie.blogspot.com",negative,4,tt0816692
"If you simply see this as a straightforward storytelling prison film, then it is excellent (10/10) because it truly gets you involved in its main character. It is an extremely enjoyable and compelling experience with a heartfelt and well-acted buddy-story at its core. It delicately--and sometimes brutally--juxtaposes Andy Dufresne's (Tim Robbins) good-natured character with the harshness of prison life, projecting so much heart in doing so. However delightful as it is, The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories and no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in either style or substance. It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches - it's only a very safe buddy-story. A damn good one, but still just that. So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or studied, because what will it be remembered for? Friendship? Huh, neat. I therefore don't think it's entirely deserving of being considered the #2 greatest film of all time on IMDb.com. But moving on and looking past that, it is possibly one of my all-time favourite films for the feelings it leaves. Sure, it often jerks you for tears just a bit too purposely, but this is forgivable because emotion is crucial to a prison story. On top of that, it never falls prey to predictable sappiness - probably because of its content which is devoid of sentimental romance and instead fills you up with a tragic friendship. It is so well-sewn together by a feel-good narrative by Morgon Freeman that it is impossible not to enjoy this film. 9/10",positive,10,tt0111161
"This is the only movie in the theaters right now that is worth your time. It has great acting, and a wonderful twist. The plot at first seems rather simple, but it eventually spans out to be much more deep than you originally thought. Leonardo Dicaprio is very good in this movie, and Mark Ruffalo is also pretty solid. The supporting cast is nothing sort of great, and I honestly couldn't notice any bad performances. In the middle of the movie some parts may seem a tad confusing, but do not worry! Everything gets cleared up in the end, and I don't think anyone will dislike the ending of the movie. The ending boosted my rating up by an entire point. The beginning sets the mood and atmosphere for the rest of the movie, the middle has intense scenes, and the ending is the resolution.

"I have just watched Fight Club for about the 10th time with the director/cast commentary and felt compelled to write about how much I love this film. Whilst most films don't bear a second viewing, the joy of Fight Club is that with each viewing another incredible detail is uncovered. There is just so much happening in every scene that one viewing is not enough - and you will miss many of the hilarious references in the dialogue if you don't go back for a second look. Any film that is critical of Martha Stewart can't be bad. I'm not going to bother with recapping the plot - too many writers on this site have already done that job for me. All I will say is that those people who were upset about the violence in Fight Club when it was released totally missed the point and probably shouldn't be seeing this sort of film anyway.... Oh, and I'm female so the explicit violence is not just for men. All the performances were fabulous (and I have to comment on how incredibly hot Mr Pitt looked) and the bleak and at times strangely lit vision of David Fincher served the story brilliantly. Probably the best film of its year and criminally overlooked during awards season, there is so much to enjoy about Fight Club. I recommend this film highly to those discerning viewers who go to see films to be challenged and to have a really good laugh because Fight Club is genuinely funny. I promise you won't be disappointed. 9/10 from me.",positive,9,tt0137523

"""The Dark Knight"" is one of the most realistic superhero movies in recent times. The way the movie has been shot, the coloring , the cinematography,the acting and the screenplay are all fantastic. The ""darkness"" so to speak has been captured brilliantly by Nolan. His color blindness comes to the fore since he uses very little red and green. Very good casting though Maggie Gyllenhall's character could've been played by someone else,maybe a Jennifer Connelly type. Christian Bale is perfect as Batman...he brings out the vulnerabilities of batman perfectly...the previous versions always showed him as a macho man who could do anything...this movie has a sense of realism attached to it. All the characters seem to have been caste so well that it seems very possible to become a batman or any other crime fighter as is shown in one scene in the film where a guy poses to be batman.Even the technology used to make the gadgets doesn't seem unreal-unlike in Iron Man where the guy builds a seemingly invincible iron suit in a cave while being watched by a bunch of terrorists 24x7. Thats what gives this movie the edge over all the superhero movies till date. No words can describe Ledger's performance. It's a pity he died when he had a lot to offer as an actor.His performance has been a lot more believable than Jack Nicholson's over the top antics in one the film's antecedents.The make up -to show a demented,neurotic killer -almost charles manson like , is what captures everyone's imagination. The acting-truly believable. I suppose the next movie two years hence will have Aron Eckhart come back as 2-face to team up with a replacement of the Joker,though it will be hard to match up to Ledger's performance .

"8.6/10 I guess I was wrong about this movie and I truly underestimated it way too much. Its been maybe 2 years since I saw it for the first time and I actually didn't like it. Now after my rewatch I truly liked it and could possibly give it 5 stars easily. The animation of ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" was honestly peak and I would honestly fight for how amazing it actually was in a debate. The comic style animation truly blended with the movie and actually made it look like a real comic book movie coming to life experience. Amazing can't even imagine how hard it actually was to even complete it and how difficult the process was to make it. Literally peak could easily be one of my favourite animation styles ever. The English voice acting tho wasn't actually bad I mean yeah I liked it and I enjoyed hearing the actors voices,but I honestly remembered and expected something way too cool and maybe better since the 2 years I watched it for the first time. There wasn't a greek version tho so yeah it was very good but not the perfect one. Did you actually enjoyed a CaRtOoNiDh sTyLe sPiDeR-mAn MoViE? YEAH OBVIOUSLY!!IIt was amazing!!Even tho i rewatched it and actually remembered maybe the 80% of the plot and the story I actually enjoyed it and I honestly can't wait to go and see the sequel...oh lord please good... Anyways,yeah I actually liked and enjoyed it. The plot could easily be a 10 out of 10 honestly but I'm not really sure if I actually was amazed by it or anything I mean yeah the plot twists were amazing,the main plot was amazing,but as I mentioned before I actually remembered a lot of these so I wasn't actually shocked,but if it was my first watch I would easily gave it a 10 out of 10 without a single doubt. Come on movie you were supposed to be the perfect animation film don't destroy everything with a simple ending and nothing to talk about it. Yeah it was a very good ending,but come on...you could obviously do way better than that and I actually believe you can do it in the second film. Even tho I rewatched it I wasn't actually bored yeah I remembered the most of the film but I was actually interested in it and never lost my interest. I liked how to plot was keep moving and was simply waiting for the end. The writing was very very good could possibly be the best written Spiderman film ever but honestly the movie actually based the most of it on different variants of Spider-Man and that's when I literally believed that this particular movie isn't the best one. Apart from that,it was very very good almost peak for an animation film released in 2018. The casting wasn't anything to be amazed about,just simple good and actually good.... Ayoooo Nicholas cage was casted in this movie?!Now that's why I thought that something bad was in this movie... The animated environments were honestly very good,not a fan of talking about them but as a simple viewer yeah I liked them and honestly the animators did a very good job a huge bravo to them and to the whole production for this movie. Ahhhhh the soundtrack my favourite part of this film. To be fair,I am not actually a fan of the the new rap style but I really don't wanna talk about it. My main point of why I actually liked this movie's soundtrack was the original soundtrack...Damn bro Prowler's theme has to be my new ringtone just to scare literally anybody around me...Damn boy the chase soundtrack,the fight soundtrack literally everything from this was perfect,but as I mentioned before I am not a fan of the new rap style and I actually have to give thr soundtrack an 8 out of 10... (I actually think i underestimate this movie for the second time and I am actually sad about it I really try to like and give it a 10 out of 10 but I think I would overrate it...I really don't know I think it's my own perspective and can't do something I don't want to just because this movie is a masterpiece for the rest of the people.) To summarize,""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is actually a masterpiece and a well done film I would easily recommend it to anybody who hasn't seen it yet which I think it is kinda impossible... who knows? I didn't like it as just as I wanted and I think I can't do anything about it...I can't give it a 10 out of 10 maybe the second movie will actually change my mind and make me like the first one more, who knows. I will probably go and see the second one today I literally can't wait for it!",neutral,6,tt4633694

The answer- a very small number...Fight Club is to me an amazing piece of cinema..The thing about truly great cinema as i have observed first hand by recommending this movie to friends and family members is that you will always get mixed reviews and maybe it will only be a small percentage sometimes.. but almost always a great movie will get through to someone..Fight Club for me is that type of movie...This is one of my all time favourites. I'm not going to divulge in to the whole plot of this movie as i believe it must be seen first hand to be truly appreciated.The Writing is superb as is the acting,also this movie contains one of the most thought provoking twists i have ever seen in a movie which i think is a key aspect to movie greatness.. something that will truly make u think and grasp your attention.The underlying theme of this movie i think will play a very strong role in making peoples decisions and opinions of this movie.As the underlying theme will clash with peoples morals,peoples way of life,and peoples basic opinions as human beings.No one can say that if someone told you that all of your material possessions were absolutely useless to you and u only need basic things to get real happiness out of life ,that you would agree 100% with them,there would always be a tiny thing that we love that we wouldn't , and couldn't cope with losing.. this movie brings the basic fear to life and shows us that we really don't need all these material objects..This , i think scares people..it scares people because a lot of people will not want to be influenced by a movie but some will embrace it and realise that its a movie with a very valid point. i am one of those people.. Some people will not like this movie for very different reasons and some will love it for other reasons also.By No Means can i say that this is the greatest movie ever.. because you can draw different opinions and views of every movie for one reason or another.There is all types of great movies such as epic,comedy,romance etc... but movies like these are also in that category movies such as Fight club,American Beauty,etc.. If You haven't already i urge you to go and see this great movie hopefully like me you will not be disappointed .. 10/10-Amazing!!",positive,10,tt0137523
"Don't get me wrong, It's a GOOD movie, but it doesn't live to the hype. Everyone mentioned this is ""a masterpiece. the greatest movie of 2008"", even It's score, 9.5/10 in IMDb made it the #1 movie of all times. But I disagree. The movie is formulated, good guy, bad guy, the whole nine yards; Not enough punching, too much talking and the movie is far too long. The only good reason to watch this movie is Heath Ledger as the joker; Ledger's joker steals the show and far suppresses Jack Nicholson's performance in the first batman movie. Conclusion - go see it but don't get your hopes up. It's still a movie about a guy wearing a bat suite, and nothing more.",neutral,5,tt0468569
"When a movie is listed at No. 1 on the IMDb, and when this same movie is ranked No. 3 by the AFI, it has got to be a good film. And no one doubts that is what The Godfather is. Indeed, the acting is incredible, the directing awesome, the plot good and the climax shocking and beautiful. Overall the movie is great, surely deserving a place in the Top 100, Top 20, maybe even the Top 10 (although not mine personally). But I truly do not see No. 1 or No. 3. I really can't place my finger on it, and perhaps another viewing on a better-quality tape will help, but it seems to me that The Godfather's hype has gotten to the point where enjoyment of the movie is starting to be flawed because of it. 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0068646
"True Grit 2010 is a very good movie although it losses the strong grip in few sequences. The Direction, Acting, Story/Screenplay, Editing and most of the content are praiseworthy but The Cinematography is Outstanding, it makes the movie look very real and takes you in 1800's. Considering it's a remake, I must say it might be a better version because it creates an even better environment. I was not sure that I'd like the movie (because I didn't like No Country For Old Men much) I was not expecting anything but I was wrong its very good. Also I didn't expect any thing funny but there were thing made me laugh. I am going to give it a 8.2/10. 10 Oscar nominations are deserved IMO.",negative,2,tt1403865
"Honestly it was 2 hours of entertainment but still it's not what I expected out of such crew, I am so sorry to say such as many of my friends found me dumb to say such thing about this movie anyway I have 2 major goofs against the movie although Martin Scorsese smartly intend to film many unnecessary scenes to distract us so we can't expect where is the movie is going like for an example the Asian guy that Matt Damon killed and the brown envelope scene. I still have big question mark about why Matt Damon didn't simply give the cell phone number of the rat Leonardo once he got it to jack Nicholson so he calls him and it's end of the story, the other thing is why would Leonardo ask Matt Damon to come to this old block and put himself in such risk he could simply took the evidences to the police and Matt Damon will be dead. So sorry guys I love mob movies but this one is nothing compared to the old fashion movies like Donnie Brasco for an example. I will give it 6/10 Cheers",neutral,6,tt0407887
"I gave The Wolf of Wall Street an honest try but had to turn it off after a few minutes. From the get-go, the film throws you into a world of unfiltered vulgarity, indulgence, and moral emptiness; while I understand that this is intentional and satirical, the sheer tone was too much for me. I didn't find it clever or engaging; just crude for shock's sake. May e it finds its footing later, but if the first impression is meant to set the stage, it told me loud and clear this wasn't a story I wanted to sit through.

"After reading my opening sentence, I'm sure there is a large offended group of people so let me clarify. I enjoyed the movie. It was fun to watch, good entertainment and decent action. However it is lacking in a few key areas. As I list them, I consider the two movies as one so keep that in mind. Most importantly for me, very few of the characters show any depth. The guy that plays Alec Trevlyn in GoldenEye (I forget his characters name and the name of the actor but I'm sure you all know who i'm talking about) was one of the few who did exercise multiple levels of character and demonstrated internal conflict. Deep down he really wanted the ring and the associated power, but he over came this and ended up dying nobely for the survival of Frodo and the success of the destruction of the ring. Golem projected a similar struggle, but at this point we (the movie goers and not the book readers) are unsure of weather he does succede in snuffing his desire. All the other members of the fellowship had their personalities shaped early on and their actions are becoming painfully predictable; espicially Frodo. Acting is often regarded as ""brilliant"" or ""stunning"" by the members of the cast. But as mentioned above, the hobbits, elves, men, wizards and so forth are not multilayerd. ""Superficial"" isn't the right word, but it's the first to come to mind. Honestly, I care much more about a character who is dealing with internal conflict as well as external. Undoubtedly, our ""wee people of the Shire"" face extreme conflict from other sources, but little from them selves. (The struggle with desperation over the ring could be labeled as ""internal"" but I got the impression the ring's power was too much for most beings. But feel free to place it where you like.) Another common speaking point for LOTR fanatics is the cinema-tography. Aside from a few too many (although impressive arials backed by strong music) nothing comes directly to mind as good camera work, mainly because there is far too much computer generation. I understand that the effects are necessary for the credibilty of the film, but it loses cinematic appeal in the process becasue, as of yet, CG scenes are still quite evident. There are parts of the film that are exceptionally strong. The story speaks for it self as one of the greatest adventures I'm aware of. But you all know as well as I, that the story does not make the movie. However, little of this credit can go to any one involed with the film becasue it is a very near and accurate account of the novels. Maybe every thing I've written is wrong and out of line. Maybe I just did this because I'm bitter that these two movies keep other films out of the high ranks tey deserve. (ie. Memento, Dr. Strangelove, Pulp Fiction etc.) Overall, 6/10",neutral,6,tt0120737
"Today I watched a bunch of people literally embarrass themselves. This movie is unique in that it is insanely awful. Every single part of this movie is just so unfunny. It feels like the worst parts of middle school youtube humor at best and at worst makes me want to call the police immediately.

All of the writers are deranged psychopaths but also 12 cause they can't write to save their lives. This movie is also incredibly offensive oh my god. Every technical element in this film feels beyond amateur. The sound design, soundtrack, sound editing, its egregious. The camera work is done by a 3 year old. It feels like worse than commercial quality. Terrible effects, terrible blood, terrible everything and I watched all of it. None of it is funny, nothing. I did not laugh a single time. Just constant cringe and sadness. Haha kids are cussing haha so funny Overall this does deserve the reputation it gets.

"Many have compared this to the Kentucky Fried Movie, and while that IS an apt comparison, this runs more like the Grindhouse version of comedy. Also, there are so many versions of this particular work out there, I'm finding it difficult to rate the work. There is a sexier (and subsequently naughtier) version, which appears to be more a theatrical release, while the cleaner version includes skits left out of the racier version, which are not as funny as the ""adult"" skits they replace. Whichever version you watch, however, there is a ton of entertainment to be found. Whether you're in the market for a condom or trying to watch the nonexistent movie through numerous breaks, this is entertaining. I like it, though once you've seen it, you've seen it.

"I liked this movie because it is good entertainment. Its ideas of ghosts and spirits, of powers that heal are nice. And no one can possibly have forseen the unforgettable ending However, the movie is a far cry from ""Brilliant!"" or ""Masterpiece!"" status. At times very slow-moving, it centers too much on the little boy's supernatural encounters, incidents and not nearly enough on the effect it has on the people around him. The plot is not well-developed enough. It seems that Bruce Willis' character decides ""ooooh if you help them, they will go away."" He does, and they go away. Very sappy and forgettable. Haley Joel does give a good performance for someone of his age, and Willis is crucial in his supporting role. The conversation with his mother in the car was touching, but moments of real emotional epiphanies are few in this movie. 7.5/10",neutral,5,tt0167404
"First things first, Nolan had redefined ""Batman"" in the 2005's ""Batman Begins"" in such a brilliant and unexpected way.He helped Batman to retain the standards that the character was loosing. So it was very important for him to make the sequel more powerful & fully of impact to overcome the hype. Now the movie opens with unexpected and witty entry of the joker .Once in an interview it was asked to Nolan that why Ledger and he answered because he is fearless. the joker character is excellently pulled by Heath ledger,I wish he was alive to see how great work he has done with joker. The joker does not believe in following the rules he just does what he wants that makes him dangerous and fearless like Nolan said. This movie is not just about action and special effects,but has many ideologies that a person should learn from this movie. There's a line in the movie where Harvey dent played flawlessly by Aaron Eckhart ,""You either die hero,or wait your entire life and become a villain"". Until the intermission or just 20 minutes before it you would think that this movie entirely belongs to the joker.But Nolan has made this movie in such a way that it can be called as Joker: Batman=4:1, that means if there are four great scenes pulled by joker then there's one scene of the batman to equalize it. Rest of the cast especially Micheal Caine and Maggie she has given the role of Rachel Dawes her own touch.It won't for me to praise this masterpiece as you know it is ruling the B-O. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>10/10<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<",positive,10,tt0468569
"Coming into this title I had high expectations, this is supposed to be one of the best films ever made, right? Well... I couldn't agree less. While I enjoyed the style, editing, and overall creativity, I couldn't shake off the empty feeling left by Fight Club's narrative pacing. The film takes what feels like an eternity to take off, and it could have been much more effective with a shorter runtime. At around 1 hour and 30 minutes, the story might have felt more tightly woven and would have maintained its momentum. By the halfway mark, I had a sinking feeling that the conclusion would fall flat. It's disappointing when a film with such creative potential fails to deliver a satisfying payoff, leaving viewers with a sense of disillusionment rather than enlightenment. While I understand the appeal of Fight Club and why it resonates with so many viewers, I can't help but question its placement in the top 250 on IMDb or its status as one of the best films ever made. Sure, it scores points for creativity and originality, but there are undoubtedly better films out there that don't receive the same level of recognition. It seems that Fight Club's cult status has elevated it to a pedestal that it might not entirely deserve. Nevertheless, I still believe that Fight Club is a must-watch for cinephiles, which is why I'm giving it a 7/10.",positive,7,tt0137523
"Intense thrillers really would be my thing and this one here was just brilliant. The entire movie is extremely unsettling, like there's something amiss. Like there is a very limited amount of blood and gore in it but its still terrifying. The script Is great. Literally everything that was said just makes sense. There were one or two things in the story that I didn't get like who gave hannibal the metal thing. Idk if that was explained and I just missed it. Obviously jodie Foster is perfect in her role but Anthony Hopkins is phenomenal. His preformance Is considered one of the best ever and I definitely believe it. His portrayal of cannibal is so bone chilling it's really what makes the movie. 9.6/10.",neutral,6,tt0102926
"Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse is a mediocre movie. There are some things that I like and don't like about it. When the first teaser came out, I expected it to focus on Miles and Peter B. Parker, but it didn't happen. Instead, Peter was accompanied by various colorful spider people. Essentially, like glitter on paper. I think it would have been better if the movie was only about the two of them, so you could care more about Miles. Unfortunately, in the movie, Miles is overshadowed by the other spider people (some of whom didn't even have a reason to be there). As for Kingpin, he just didn't fit the story (no pun intended). Spider Gwen was whatever. However, I like that there were some risks in the film, and the first 3 minutes were gold. I've watched it three times to understand I why I didn't like it as much as the rest did, but it didn't change anything for me. 5/10.",neutral,5,tt4633694
"(I saw this on DVD, YMMV) Summary: Leonard Shelby is a man who has no short term memory since being injured defending his wife an attack that resulted in her rape and murder.  For some reason that is not really clear, the police have never caught the attackers, so Leonard has vowed to hunt down and kill them.  However, he cannot remember a thing that has happened since the day he lost his short-term memory and ten minutes ago.  Therefore, he is constantly having no memory of why he is doing things and uses a series of pictures and notes to help sort it out. To give the same feeling to the audience, the director shows the scenes in reverse order.  The opening scene of the movie essentially has Leonard looking at a picture of Teddy with the words ""kill him"" written underneath in his handwriting.  Leonard proceeds to kill Teddy.  Just as that is all Leonard has to go on, that is all the audience has.  Then the movie backs up a little bit and shows Leonard gleaning the last bit of information that convinces him Teddy is the killer and we see him actually writing ""kill him"" on Teddy's picture.  This backing up continues until we find out the real secrets in the movie. The Good: Guy Pierce gives a very good performance as Leonard. The transitions between the scenes are very smooth.  There is just enough overlap at the start and end of each scene that the transitions are very easy to follow.  In addition, there is a small part of the film that runs forward in time, mostly Leonard telling a backstory to someone on the phone. These are easily distinguished by being shot in black and white, while the rest of the film is in color. The Bad: There is an unrelenting lust for death that drives Leonard.  No one, not even Teddy who might be a cop, discusses the idea of vigilantism.  That Leonard should hunt down and kill whoever he thinks might be the killer, the justice system be damned, is never questioned.  It is the mindless writing of a bad action movie at work here. Although the reverse order presentation is easy to follow, it began to wear thin.  Perhaps it is because, and other reviewers have mentioned, that this story told in chronological order would be weak, at best.  The film relies too much on this one trick of storytelling without anything else to really back it up. The clincher that something is desperately wrong is the pat summation speech at the end of the film.  Throughout the film, the reliance is on how Leonard is going to remember some particular fact, but we are only given the quickest glances of the actual results of Leonard's investigations.  In an attempt to make a rather dull story seem mysterious, the makers have told us so little about the story that they make up for the error with ""the speech that explains everything."" 5/10",neutral,5,tt0209144

"I went into the Godfather expecting a masterpiece from all the reviews and how it number 2 or 3 on the IMDb top 250 films. After watching it I found it very disappointing for a few reasons. 1. You can't understand what the Godfather is saying half the time for the most part it all sounds like he's wheezing. If your going to watch this film put on subtitles. 2. Its way to long. the movie is just shy of 3 hours long! Thats long enough and especially most of the time nothing is going on. I found myself not paying attention to most of the boring parts in the film and there's a lot. Now I know what your saying, your saying that i don't like long films. To you I say false i don't mind long films like the LOTR Return of the king is 4 hours + in the extended edition but there's a difference LOTR is entertaining there's action going on throughout 80% of the film. Now I'm not saying I hated the movie I'm justing saying it has a few flaws and its not perfect by any means. Now I have yet to see Part 2 maybe that will change my mind but right now it doesn't appeal to me because its 4 hours + long!

"Edward Norton thus becomes my favorite Hollywood actor. His performance, along with the whole cast's is one of the many feathers, American History X wears on its hat. Rolled with excellent cinematography & music, it talks about the merits & demerits of racism in America, although it mirrors the plight of whole world. The intensity with which the plot id dealt is extremely appreciable. Good story, which takes the viewers directly into the point. Non-linear narration keeps the pace of the movie fine but it seems intensified towards the end and that shakes the whole film a bit.

Well, I guess I can't fault them for that... but there are many other things to fault this movie for. I'd say the worst part about this movie is the comedy. There were maybe one or two things that were actually funny, the rest were just attempts at juvenile humor, which have some potential to be funny but just fall flat in this movie. The plot was decent. Neil Patrick Harris is back playing the same psychopathic version of himself that he did so well in the last one. In fact, his role here is the reason this movie got a 4/10 instead of a 2/10. Though things got really, really stupid in the last fourth of the movie, but the plot picked up a bit right at the end.

"I am in the minority on this one, given the current 8.6 rating and its ranking at #26 all-time (!), but I have two major issues with ""Life is Beautiful"" that hold me back from joining others and proclaiming it a classic. Plot in a nutshell: A cartoonish man in WWII Italy wins the heart of a local beauty (after much effort). Years later he is sent to a 'death camp' where he tries to shield his young son from the horrors that surely await them both. Issue #1: Maybe it's just me, but isn't Roberto Benigni's character Guido highly annoying? Let's recap - early in the film, we see him - uninvited - creepily and unnecessarily sucking on the leg of a woman he doesn't know (to extract 'wasp poison' he says); he is constantly trying to steal another man's hat (because it's better than his, apparently); he steals the school inspector's ribbon and then impersonates him at the local elementary school, where (because he doesn't know what to say when he's asked to give a speech) he strips down to his underwear in front of the children....need I go on? To put it bluntly, Guido is NOT an endearing character, at all. He is a bit of a creep and a petty thief and he talks too much, with nothing near the charm of Chaplin's ""Tramp,"" to whom he's been compared here by some. I don't get it. I was immediately turned off by his antics and never was able to warm up to him as the film wore on. Issue #2: The scenes in the death camp can only be described as fantasy. In fact, the entire film should be labeled as fantasy, because what we are shown is so far removed from reality it can't be categorized as anything else. Maybe I would have embraced it more had I known this going in, but I did not. Example: 
 one of the early camp scenes, where Guido gets a hold of the camp loudspeaker and broadcasts a message to his wife, and somehow is not caught or punished for this? In reality he would have been shot ON THE SPOT and that would have been the end of this film. There are numerous similar instances of completely unrealistic and imaginary situations in the camp to move the plot along......yet we are supposed to become immersed in what is going on, knowing full well none of it could have possibly happened this way? Yeah I just can't do that. Having said all of this, you CAN sense the connection father and son have, it's palpable, it's real. And you want to believe that the father would indeed try anything to save his family, up to and including sacrificing himself if he has to. The film does convey that quite effectively, and because of that, it has some merit. I just don't find it to be 'one of the greatest films ever' like many other people seemingly do. In essence it's a feel-good fantasy set in one of the worst imaginable nightmares of human history. In direct opposition to the feeling of this film, and a much more accurate representation of how the camps affected the people interned in them, I'll provide a quote from Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel's book ""Night"": ""Here there are no fathers, no brothers, no friends. Everyone lives and dies for himself alone."" 6/10. Light-hearted tale of survival set in a place where hope for most people had long since disappeared. Would I watch again?

Great casting, quirky story with several hilarious one liners and rhymes from our little green friend. Special effects are a blast to watch - though not great.

"i don't understand how a movie so crappy like this one ever got this high rating. first i must say that ridley scott is considered by me an awfull director. alien was the only good movie he ever directed. blade runner is totally overrated, black rain shouldn't be considered a movie, 1492 is completely ridiculous, black hawk down is one of the worse war movies i have ever seen and hannibal is only an ok film. the plot is ludicrous. a gladiator, former army man, that begins a personal vendetta against the emperor and finally gets away with it? i don't think so. there is also this kind of love story between him and lucilla that is totally out of place. cast is awful. russel crowe is dull as maximus and he certainly doesn't look as a gladiator. he had better performances in ""a beautiful mind"" and in ""l. a confidential"". joaquin pheonix is absurd as usual, let's face it, this man can't act, a few tears doesn't prove him a good actor, pitty river phoenix is dead (that was trully a good actor). richard harris is poor as marcus aurelius and oliver reed is surprisingly bad as some sort of gladiator manager. still, the movie has some good points: drek jacobi is very good as a senator and the first battle scene is a real joy. but this two things doesn't save the rest of the movie. i almost forgot: it's very overlong, seems like it will never finish. 2/10.",negative,2,tt0172495
"When I first heard about this movie, I cringed. Maybe because of the horrible taste of ""Batman & Robin"" , or maybe because I expected it to be a mediocre movie. I was right. I've seen both. Let me say, ""Begins"" is not what it's made out to be. As many others have stated before, ""Batman Begins"" should be called Bruce Wayne Begins. There is no Batman until late in the movie, and the Batman that does show up is very disappointing. I have no problem with Christian Bale, at all. I think he is a excellent actor, especially in ""Equilibrium"" and ""Reign of Fire"". He tried his hardest to be a good Batman, and I give him kudos for that. Everything else about this movie, I groaned. Too well-lit, no back-story, Gotham City looks like New York for Christ sake's. The Batmobile is a tank, and the villains, please. If I put on Batman '89, I would remember it for a few weeks on end. Huming the beautiful theme, remembering great scenes, and more. But with ""Begins"", no way. I've seen this 3 times now, and I still can't remember anything about this film. Let's hope the sequel is better. -3/10",negative,3,tt0372784
"It deserves my 1/10. Do not take this lightly, this still hangs high on my altar of cinema, and for many reasons which may be of interest to everyone. Your first impression after seeing this may be that my title for this review is correct, so why read on? Well, the film is hilarious, utterly packed with stupid lines, which after seeing this I became obsequious to the degree that everyone I knew had to see this, and therefore understand the silly jokes. Though a deity is not a silly joke - and nor is this film. Its subject matter is, admittedly rather dubious, though Warren throughout commands the same authority over all elements with as much incompetency as Churchill's anti-Soviet policy (as had he succeeded in Norway, the UK would have been in a war with Germany and the USSR). A family travel to the eponymously sinful ""Valley Lodge,"" a stunted creature named Torgo ""invites"" us, and the family inside. There they are treated to sexual harassment in person and from afar. Horrific. Hilarious! It is the first genuine attempt I have come across where absolute novices have tried to make a feature film on a tiny independent budget. Not an expense is spent on running through the script, editing the finished piece, the composer of the music, the performers of this music, and rather literally so, everyone involved. I would only recommend this piece if you could understand that humour is often dark and unrelenting. Ray Liotta is on the TV and Gustav Mahler I am listening to.",negative,1,tt0060666
"What is wrong with reviewers these days? Good movies get bad reviews and bad ones get good reviews. This movie belonged to the later category. No where near the all-round quality of a movie with a 8+ rating. Are the makers of the movie hiring third world reviewers to inflate the movie's rating? I think so. Numerous people hated this movie just as I did, but the movie's rating suggests otherwise. There were cute parts in the movie but was annoying and meanders along for the majority of it. No wow factor here. It's just another Hollywood Ponzi scheme. 1/10 to deflate rating to a more realistic value.",negative,1,tt2096673
"This movie was a MASSIVE letdown. I've heard so many great things about it that I thought I was in for the best movie of my life. It was not. The ONLY thing that kept it afloat was the acting/casting. Hannibal Lector is truly an incredible character (with also the coolest name ever), and Anthony Hopkins absolutely nailed it. He was of course the stand out, but all of the others were fantastic too. With the exception of this, there was nothing else to the movie that really stood out to me. I did, however, find myself confused a few times. Overall, I don't know that l'd recommend it. I have no idea how it became such a classic, but to each their own I guess.

"The movie starts out great. And it continues to be good. Okay, critizising modern life and civilization may not have been too new anymore when this movie came out (""Trainspotting"" and ""The Beach"" had done that in a similar fashion before) but it was very well done. The cast acted nicely (Brad Pitt's acting is a little like in ""12 Monkeys"") and the direction was decent so i thought this was going to be a really good movie. But I should have known not to judge a movie until I see its end. ""Fight Club"" has an absolute idiotic ending! SPOILERS AHEAD. The first thing is, Schizophrenia just doesn't work like this, okay? It's not like you talk to yourself as if you were standing in front of someone else. Besides, I wonder why Edward Norton took that role after he had already played a similar part in ""Twilight"". Secondly, how can Norten still be alive after he shot himself in the head??? How is that possible?? Too bad, this could have been so much better! 6/10",neutral,6,tt0137523
"Aside of this film being a cult classic, the kind of movies you watch once in your lifetime, enjoy it, and later on watch it 5 more times and love it more and more with every re-watch. The Dark Knight is a movie that in my opinion has set a high standard to movies nowadays and how they should be made. Either it's Heath Ledger's ultimate performance of a antagonistic, or the structure of the story that plays well, The Dark Knight is the kind of movie I can't find one bad thing to say about it (same case of movies such as The Big Labowski, Back to the Future and A New Hope). I want to direct you to a YouTube channel called ""Lessons From the Screenplay"" by Michael Tucker, his channel made a great video analysis on The Dark Knight and its craft of the ultimate antagonistic: how he needs to be powerful, good at attacking the opponent's greatest weakness, compete and fight to achieve the same goal as the hero and so on. With all that being said, the movie has genuinely shown us what needs to be in a villain to be compelling. Every other feature in this film is made in such a careful way to perform the best way possible:
The composing and soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. The cinematography in every single shot. ""The Nolan Crosscut"" in the third act of the film. The rest of the cast's performance in this film. And so on, etc. Every time I watch this film (and Michael Tucker's analysis). I get goosebumps, I'm thrilled and get excited with every re-watch. It's the kind of movies that have also set a high standard as I mentioned earlier. This movie gives a huge slap in the face to every other mediocre superhero film, and puts in the center subjects much smaller and significant, and grows them to be center elements of a story: character's choices and true colors, chaos vs. Order, sacrifice and endurance, etc. These elements are so significant and get to be the center of the story, any other movie should embrace this method of taking small things and expanding them. In conclusion, this is by far the best film in the ""superhero"" category. But it's not a superhero movie, it's something much more realistic and compelling than having a CGI figure walk through the scene. If anyone wants to make movies and set themselves a high standard, they should look at The Dark Knight as an example.",positive,9,tt0468569
"I couldn't help but feel incredibly let down as I left the theatre after this one. Many aspects of this film were certainly above average but I fail to see how this could be considered a classic many years from now or even one of the best films of the year. The films un-doing lies in its ending. At the moment when that key element of the plot falls into place it certainly does seem interesting. Yet, as soon as one begins to think about it and its repercussions on the plot, the film comes to pieces. If the film had chosen a logical ending to fill in the stories more than obvious holes, I might have felt not quite as cheated. If u really must go see it, pay attention to Haley Joel Osments performance, definitely one of the least annoying from a child actor. A very generous 5/10.",neutral,5,tt0167404
"If there is a movie that clearly proves the ""So bad it's good"" philosophy is this one. ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" quickly gained a huge cult-following after being named ""the worst movie ever made"" and gave its failed director, Edward Wood Jr., the fame and recognition he never could achieve while alive. However, and despite its enormous amount of mistakes, ""Plan 9"" has a bizarre charm that makes it different than other movies: it has heart. It is the legacy of a man whose love for films was bigger than his artistic skills, and that could do anything to complete a movie. ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" is, according to its narrator, the Amazing Criswell, the retelling of the fateful day when a group of aliens tried to destroy the planet Earth, by re-animating the dead to destroy the living. An old man (Bela Lugosi) and his wife (Vampira) are the first ghouls re-animated by the aliens in their ninth attempt to destroy the earth. The plot, as weird as it sounds nowadays, was really a variation on the usual sci-fi plot of the days of McCarthyism and the fear of invaders. However, Wood's script is filled with weird dialogs that one can only take as the unedited script. It is obvious that Wood was desperate to make the movie so he shot everything not caring if what he had written sounded good on screen. Despite the poor writing of his films, Wood always tried to put a social commentary on his films, and ""Plan 9"" shows his lack of confidence in the Government and maybe in humanity in general. About the obvious ""mistakes"", some say it was due to low-budget, others state that it was due to his overconfidence; the fact remains that Wood almost never shot a scene twice no matter the results. This terrible mistake become one of Wood's main characteristics through his career, and in Plan 9 is painfully notorious. Every shot seems to be in the movie no matter if the cardboard tombs fell or if an actor makes a mistake; the show must go on and the picture must be finished. The bizarre edition (going from day to night and vice-versa) and the use & abuse of stock footage is another of Wood's characteristics that make this film so special. The performances of Tor Johnson and Vampira, Pual Marco and Dudley Manlove, and the unforgettable Bela Lugosi truly complete the show. Probably Ed Wood's life and the story about the creation of ""Plan 9"" are a better tale than ""Plan 9"" itself; Tim Burton's fictionalized biopic ""Ed Wood"" is a good proof of that. However, ""Plan 9"" is a must-see for every fan of cinema, and specially for everyone interested in film-making, as it is the job of a man who had his soul definitely in cinema, but his talent definitely in other place. One could say after reading this huge amount of flaws that ""Plan 9"" is an unwatchable piece of trash, and while maybe they are right; Wood's masterpiece has an enormous charm that makes everything look good. It is a weird feeling the one that ""Plan 9"" conveys, a feeling of tenderness and naiveté that infects the viewer with Wood's spirit and makes the unwatchable being enjoyable, and turns the trash into a classic. That is ""Plan 9""'s incredible paradox: it is probably the only movie where one can proudly say ""It is so bad that is good"". It is a 5/10 that tastes like a 10/10.",neutral,5,tt0052077
"IMO, this movie didn't meet my expectations at all. In fact.... It surpassed and exceeded them. As I walked into the theater, I found myself mentally cursing myself for watching all the previews and movie updates fearing that I had spoiled myself. Simply put, I was wrong. The major players here are Batman (Bruce Wayne), Harvey Dent, The Joker (duh!), Rachel, and Lt Gordon. Those are the characters (with the exception of Joker) are the only ones really worth mentioning because of the growth they go through in the movie. You see Bruce suffer through things that would make anyone else either kill themselves or go insane. His darkness isn't portrayed as clichéd brooding or angst, but a certain level of darkness which I can not even find the words for. Whatever it is, Christian Bale pulls it off beautifully. Then we have Harvey Dent(Aaron Eckhart); pretty much the same as Batman, but in a different sort of light. He wants to tackle crime and make the city a better place. His crusade eventually leads him down the road of hell as the Joker takes a personal interest in destroying him. I cant give away too much, but Eckhart really shows his versatility as he plunges into an even darker hell of what Bruce goes through. And then we have the Joker (Ledger). Without a doubt, the best performance I've seen in a long time. He really steals the show. I will be quoting his lines for the next two weeks and mimicking him around my friends for the next few weeks. His performance made me laugh at things that would normally be sick and demented, but strangely I felt OK to laugh at a hospital being blown up. The Joker has a sick sense of humor that would (and should) make Jack Nickolson and every other Joker player be proud. Then there's Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhal). If you walk into the theater and expect an Mary Jane, damsel in distress stereotype think again. She has those moments yes, but she makes it work for her. Her love triangle between Bruce and Harvey adds a welcome relief from the chaos that surrounds them. Lt. Gordon (Gary Oldman) delivers some of the most surprising performances, and I think one of the better ones of his career. He plays the down to earth, sensible guy who desperately tries to keep his sanity for the sake of the city. Keep a close eye on him for he (and Harvey) will throw you some curve balls. And those are just the major players. Caine, Freeman, Roberts, and a host of other talented actors and actresses only add to the epicness. That plus the plot which will give you glimpses into this world and almost makes you believe that they're real. And if you're expecting a happy ending, think again. This is one of the most depressing endings I've seen in a long time. The drama, the action (ever see a diesel rig flip over nose first?), the dark humor, and much more easily makes this one of the best films of the decade and really raises the bar for not just comic book adaptations, but movies in general. 9.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0468569
"Se7en is about 2 detectives who are trying to catch a sadistic murderer who uses the seven deadly sins as his method of operation. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman both have very powerful characters and perform brilliantly. The thing i enjoy most about seven is the weird and creepy way the film is done and how dark and disturbing the film is, it really has an affect on you and an affect is what we go the cinema for. Se7en also has a magnificent twist ending just to top it all off. VERDICT: Simply a spine chilling masterpiece. 9.3/10",negative,3,tt0114369
"SE7EN is the story of two detectives working on their first (and last) murder case together. Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire and seems to be a bit show-offish around his partner Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), who continues to try to prove that he is a competent detective, despite Somerset's uncertainty. But the two are forced to put their differences aside when a suspicious and intriguing new case comes up. The murderer kills a variety of different people and writes the name of the sin he feels they have committed on the wall of the murder site in whatever substance he happens to find at the time. For example, he writes GREED in blood, GLUTTONY in grease, etc. SE7EN is mostly just your run-of-the-mill murder mystery story, a genre which I've never really been into. However, this movie is also different in a couple of ways. The story, for one, I find to be incredibly clever. The murderer's plan is highly original and almost makes sense, in an insane sort of way. Every move the murderer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), makes is just another step in his plan, and all lead up to the ending--which, I have to say, is absolutely brilliant. I think what sets SE7EN apart from most murder mystery movies is that it requires you to think a bit more. Instead of simply showing the exciting parts of a detective's job, such as the chase scenes (and this movie has just one, but a particularly good one), it shows the long, tedious process of finding clues and investigating. I think this element brings the viewer deeper into the lives of all of the characters and instills more feelings and care for said characters. And though the murderer's plan is made clear, there are still a few foggy aspects that are required by that noggin to sort out. As for technical aspects, everything works. Morgan Freeman is a great actor, and despite what some reviewers think, I have to say Brad Pitt is too. Both do well in this movie, as does Kevin Spacey as the ""deranged murderer freak."" The script is great, if a little watered down by some cliches, and the direction is excellent. No complaints. To be honest, I wasn't truly impressed with SE7EN until the ending. It was a little cliched, a little boring, and a little tedious. But I think that's the idea--that contrast makes the ending that much more shocking and therefore more brilliant. The most perfect ending to a great crime thriller. 8.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0114369
"Old but Gold. It's been more than 3 decades after it was released but its influenced still haunting lot of movies and TV series (the recent example is The Sopranos). I don't want to write the plot in here, I believe moviegoers already familiar about the story line. It was always not about firing a gun but it was always about how a civilian turned into most powerful gangster ever; it was always about people around you might against you at the other days; it was always about the real family around your another family; it was always about the love around family; it was always about how you sacrifice your life for your family. It might be boring for you who might expecting a gun firing scene and car chasing in the middle of traffic jam; however this movie was not about that.

"I like it. This is good film and 10/10. Thanks all! I watched all series of this film. The Godfather is the finest cinematic achievement ever. It had the first truly ensemble cast, and writing which matched, if not bettered, its masterful source material. It was a truly original mafia film of its time, imitated by a lot more media as time passed. It was the first gangster film to revolve around the families of the gangsters, rather than the action, which just added to the suspense. The Godfather's essential components from its cinematography, editing, score, directing and writing can be praised to the ends of this Earth, but one thing always stands out for me: the acting. Marlon Brano's Vito Corleone is rightfully seen as the legend's greatest performance; Robert Duvall and James Caan are the two only imaginable actors (who gave instinctive performances) for the roles of Sonny Corleone and Tom Hagen. But Al Pacino, in a brilliantly developed role as Michael Corleone, stands out due to his convincing acting, along with an interesting and cohesive back story. Every other actor is appropriate for their roles, and all are phenomenal in their career best performances.

"The Dark Knight is an absolute classic and is not only one of the best Superhero/Comic Book films ever made but also one of the best Sequels ever made. Filled with Powerful direction,Brilliant Acting performances and excellent Action,The Dark Knight is Christopher Nolan at his best and most powerful. Set after the events in Batman Begins,The Dark Knight now tells the story about how now Batman/Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale)has to not only deal with the Mob,but also has to deal with a psychotic criminal named The Joker(Heath Ledger)who wants the destroy Gotham City and make the innocent corrupt. The Dark Knight is a powerful and unforgettable Classic that came out month after Heath Ledger's tragic death which cast a shadow over the film and with or without Ledger presence The Dark Knight is still an excellent film. With The Dark Knight Christopher Nolan has created an unforgettable cinematic experience,giving viewers a bigger and larger film than Batman Begins because when you look at Batman Begins as great as it is you feel like Nolan was taking a test drive with a car and trying to know the Batman world,but with The Dark Knight Nolan does not a take a test and knows this world from the ground up. With TDK Nolan gives viewers a true epic scope raising the Superhero genre to another level and makes a complex film filled with tragedy and sadness. TDK while definitely a Superhero/Comic Book film has much more in common with a Crime Drama because of gangsters and the Mob always in the film and the Cops and lawyers that are always trying to stop them and The Joker while also dealing with Money and corruption. You feel like you are watching a Superhero film if it were directed by Martin Scorsese or Michael Mann because like the Crime Dramas of those two films TDK deals with many characters and themes such as the crime,corruption and moral ambiguity. In other words TDK has more in common with Epic Crime Dramas like The Godfather,Goodfellas,Casino,The Departed and Heat than say The Fantastic Four films. Nolan creates a world in TDK where there is a since of doom and dread all around where the city of Gotham is being held hostage and just filled with tension and falling apart and waiting to explode in a shred of darkness. Batman and The Joker in this is a true story of Good and Evil with Batman trying to defend and protect the citizens of Gotham City and trying to bring some good into the city and does not kill,but The Joker is different because The Joker is true evil that just wants to see Gotham City burn and corrupt the innocent people of the city including Batman himself. The Joker believes that people in general are not good and can be brought down to his level of darkness. The film is battle but a complex one because Batman asks himself this question:What can I do at all costs to stop The Joker? Can Batman do it the right way or could Batman kill The Joker and be brought down to The Joker's level? TDK is a chess game and also a Cat and Mouse game where Batman is not only trying to save Gotham but trying to beat The Joker. The screenplay by Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan is superb with dialog and scenes that are something William Shakespere would write because the film is filled with sadness and darkness all over. Although the film is long at 2 Hours and 32 minutes the movie moves by so fast you would think that you were watching a 90 minute film than a two and half hour film. The Action scenes in the film are masterful and are much more intense than in BB. The Action is filled with great suspense and jaw-dropping visuals and will have you glued to the screen. The ending of the film lasts about 20-30 minutes and like I said before this film will have you glued to the screen but also on the edge of your seat leaving you wanting more. It is a great,sad and tragic conclusion that will leave asking questions and prepares viewers for The Dark Knight Rises. The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Christian Bale is excellent once again as Batman/Bruce Wayne bringing depth,toughness and sadness to the role. The late Heath Ledger earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his brilliant and terrifying performance as The Joker. Ledger's performance is scary,menacing and masterful making Ledger's Joker one of the greatest villains in movie history. Aaron Eckhart is great as Harvey Dent,an idealistic lawyer. Michael Caine is great once again as Alfred,Bruce's Butler. Maggie Gyllenhaal does a good job as Rachel,Bruce and Harvey's love interest. Gary Oldman is fantastic once again as Officer Jim Gordon. Morgan Freeman is great once again as Lucius Fox,Batman's weapon maker. Eric Roberts(Maroni),Anthony Michael Hall(Mike Engel),Richie Coaster(Chechen),Cillian Murphy(Scarecrow)and Nathan Gamble(James Gordan Jr.)give good performances as well. The direction by Christopher Nolan is masterful and brilliant,with Nolan using great camera angles and giving the film a haunting and beautiful visual style and also does great job in the Action scenes. Great direction from Nolan. The score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is excellent,dark and intense and matches the gritty and grim tone of the film. Amazing score by Zimmer and Howard. In final word,if you love Batman,Christopher Nolan,Comic Book films,Superhero films or films in general,I Highly suggest you see The Dark Knight,one of the best sequels ever made and a true classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0468569
"Good film for comic book fans. 'Batman Begins' takes us on a journey through Bruce Wayne's tragic past again, giving us a real insight into what drives and fuels his quest against suffering and injustice. We discover how the billionaire came to be trained in the martial arts, develop his alter ego, and acquire his technological arsenal. Christian Bale gives us a riveting performance as not only a very dark hero, but also a tortured soul looking for the means to combat the wrongs of society, a society that we see is also responsible for the death of his beloved parents. Another thing we notice from the beginning is this story does not tie into that of the other movies in the series. This is however not a disappointing feature, in fact it seems to breathe new life into this timeless classic. So for all of us who have followed the Dark Knight's journey' 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0372784

"This is a good film, though clearly below ""The Usual Suspects"" when rating films of the '90's. What makes the film stand out is its complete uniqueness. No other film comes to mind to even compare it to. The achievement of the film is that even though it is unique, there is an undercurrent of believability about the whole thing. We know that mass murderers are a disturbing reality in modern-day life. We also know that it is not unusual for such murderers to plant clues, either consciously or subconsciously, i.e., to make it into a game played between himself and the cops. This is what happens here, as the murders are carefully orchestrated to illustrate each one of the seven deadly sins. This is not so far out as it sounds, when you consider that we live in an era in which religious fanatics routinely blow themselves up for their cause, and routinely butcher countless thousands of their countrymen who oppose their cause in many places around the globe. The explanation the Kevin Spacey character gives near the end of the film is entirely believable, and his performance, brief as it is, stands out. What is less believable are the performances of Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt as the detectives. The cliche of the cop about to retire paired with the energetic young cop has been beaten to death, and I am sorry it was used here. This would have been a better film if it had featured two detectives working together without the baggage thrown in (Freeman with his ""I'm out of here"" cynicism, and Pitt with his ""new in town"" naivete). The interaction of the two detectives just did not seem genuine to me. Freeman was better in other films, like ""Driving Miss Daisy"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and ""Unforgiven"". And Pitt is just not one of my favorite actors. Those of us who are fortunate enough to live in one of the relatively few countries of the world in which the ""marketplace of ideas"" concept has taken root and flourishes are accustomed to expressing our ideas verbally. For the rest of the world, however, there is a depressingly frequent resort to violent action as a way of expressing ideas. In a world in which it is almost routine for Palestinians to sneak into Israel and blow themselves up in support of their cause, it does not seem incredible that the Kevin Spacey character here would sacrifice himself to his cause. As he says, ""Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore. You have to hit them with a sledgehammer, and then you'll notice you've got their strict attention."" 8.5/10",neutral,5,tt0114369
"(Synopsis) In 1954, U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are assigned to investigate the escape of a patient at the federal maximum security hospital/prison for the criminally insane located on Shutter Island. Once on the island, they find that the hospital and prison staffs aren't really cooperating with their investigation. It seems that the staff is hiding a big secret and Teddy is going to uncover it. Teddy believes that if he can see the records that he would break the case. In the meantime, the island is hit by a hurricane, and more dangerous patients escape and must be captured. This gives Teddy and Chuck the opportunity to check out some of the buildings to which they had been denied admission. Teddy finds the answer he was looking for. (My Comment) Shutter Island has an eerie atmosphere with flashbacks to the concentration camp at Dachau and haunting dreams throughout the entire movie. At times, you will wonder what is real and what is not. Then you will reach a point where you don't care. I started looking at my watch wanting it to be over. If you are a Leonardo fan and decide to see it, you will see that he does a good job of playing the character, but the creepy storyline is disappointing and is only good enough as a B movie. It will not take you very long to figure out the plot, especially, when you are inside Teddy's head. Overall, this movie is dreary and totally depressing.

"I have always in mind that most of the films shown at The Sundance Film Festival in a way or in another are interesting, this is one of those. A despaired man has lost his ""immediate memory"" due to the murder and rape of his wife. His thirst of revenge but do not keep anything in his memory so he is obliged to tattoo and take notes of important events, names, places, etc.. The film is shot in a sort of flashback which you start to understand it after at least 30 minutes. It is an original film which has slightly reminded me the Italian film  ""The Mnemonist"", this one plays more with the spectator to get a sort of thrilling effect. Rating: 6/10",neutral,6,tt0209144
"Review: Although this movie had some top class actors in it, the storyline lacked wit and I did get a bit bored after a while. The characters were less interesting than how they were in the first movie but there was a sweet undertone which made the movie watchable. Now that the first hotel is a success, Sonny seeks funds from an investor in America to open up a second hotel but he has to pass the undercover investigation before they go ahead with the deal. This is when the dashing Richard Gene enters the movie and Sonny gives him special treatment because he suspects that he is the undercover investigator. Gere takes a special liking to Sonny's mum but she hasn't been near a man since her husband died in the last movie. Sonny is also jealous of his fiancée's brothers best friend who is teaching her how to dance at there wedding party. With all this going on, Dench and Nighy clearly like each other but certain circumstances make there relationship hard to blossom. There are some other elements to the storyline but they weren't anything that amazing. Maggie Smith is brilliant throughout the movie but I did find Sonny, played by Dev Patel, quite annoying because of his over enthusiastic behaviour. All of the individual story lines were left open so you don't really know what happens to the characters, even though you've watched them for nearly two hours. Anyway, it's a sweet movie about getting old and falling in love and the amazing costumes and stunning scenery did look impressive but the actual film was a bit of a let down. Watchable but not that great! Round-Up: I personally think that it was the success of the first movie that made audiences flock to the cinema to see this sequel. The cast is amazing and the movie was authentic with vibrant colours but the content wasn't that great. Richard Gere, 66, pops up throughout the film but he wasn't in the movie that much. Its mostly about the relationship between Sonny and his fiancée who hit a bit of a rocky patch whilst preparing there wedding. Dev Patel has starred in a weird range of films since he hit the big screen in 2008 with Slumdog Millionaire, which include Chappie, the Last Airbender, Cherry and the Road Within. He done a great job alongside some established veteran actors in this movie but he still has a way to go to prove that he is a great actor. The movie was directed by John Madden who brought you Shakespeare in Love, the Debt with Helen Mirren, Proof with Anthony Hopkins, Captain Corelli's Mandolin with Nicolas Cage and Mrs. Brown with Judi Dench. He did get the most out of the brilliant cast in this movie but the script was a bit weak and it lacked the originality that the first movie had. Its still good to see how the same characters have progressed in life and I enjoyed the dance scenes towards the end but I was hoping for more from this sequel. Budget: $10million Worldwide Gross: $86million I recommend this movie to people who are into their comedy/dramas about a hotel owner who wants to expand his business by opening another hotel. 4/10",negative,4,tt2555736
"Fight Club is definitely not what I expected. I thought I knew what the film was about from the commercials. I was wrong. I mean REALLY wrong. I walked out of the theatre not knowing what it was that I just watched. Was it a dark comedy? Social commentary? Commercial satire? An exercise in style over substance? I don't know. Maybe all of the above, maybe none. I think it is a mistake to over analyse this movie. And let's face it, the media made way to big of a deal about the violence in this movie. I remember one station reporting that there was some fear that real life ""fight clubs"" would start springing up around the country. Get real. The fact is, most guys don't like to get in fights, or more specifically, they don't like to be hit. Maybe after a couple or ten beers, but not usually. It's taken me three or four viewings to fully appreciate this film. The directing is excellent. Fincher is a huge talent, and with this and Se7en on his resume, he's the kind of filmmaker that you know you're going to get something interesting from. Pitt can be great when he picks the right parts. And Norton is easily my favourite young actor. He always comes through. I don't really believe in a lot of the ideas that Fight Club pushes, but it's interesting none the less. And there are a lot of laughs between the gruesome beatings. Just don't take it too seriously, and you'll be okay. I give it an 8/10 stars. G'night!",positive,8,tt0137523
"I'm not going to leave a big in depth review of LotR: the Two Towers for 2 reasons: 1) I should be studying for a final and 2) I'm sure countless other people will point out all the reasons this movie was absolutely amazing. But I will leave some quick feedback saying this... I was not a fan of the first movie of this trilogy. I gave it a 6/10 on IMDb because I felt it just served as a poor, jumbled introduction with tons of nice imagery but no substantial plot or character development underneath. Nothing in the movie made an impact on me, and by the end I just wanted to get over with it already. Where the Fellowship fell sort, the Two Towers makes up and then some. Although some characters remain rather one dimensional (Legolas), we see depth in the acting and script with characters such as Aragorn, Sam, and particularly Frodo and Golum (although the ""acting"" in Golum's place isn't of the typical kind, obviously), that rivals any film I've ever seen before. Gone is the ""who cares"" feel I got from major events in the first movie, now by the end of the film when three different sub-plots are going on at the same time, I was almost equally on the edge of my seat for all three, and certainly was not uninterested in any. The plot may be clichéd and done before, but if so it's only because this is the outline that everyone else copied, this is one of THE original epic fantasy story lines ever written, and it's sincerity and urgency still comes through, despite so many copycats. I really need to get back to studying, but I will leave you with this. LotR: the Two Towers combines a deep, epic storyline, stellar acting, stunning visuals, and absolute edge of your seat action into a package the likes of which I doubt I'll ever see again in my lifetime. I hope the conclusion of the trilogy proves me wrong, but until then... do yourself a favor and see this movie over the winter break. 10/10",neutral,6,tt0167261
"I found this movie to be rather trivial and predictable.  It was, in many ways, a Forrest Gump version of a prison movie.  It had a manipulative and superficial plotline, and the leading character was too good to be true. It never dealt deeply with any issue at all.  Basically, you liked the leading character because he was perfect, and cheered him on and hoped for his success, just like Forrest Gump.  However, unlike Forrest Gump, I could never see the true emotion of the Tim Robbins character.  He didn't like being sexually assaulted, but we never saw how that affected him; he didn't drink but got beers for his friends.  He finds pleasure out of the simple things and doesn't like unpleasurable things.  He turned out to be a perfect character with no negative qualities at all.  Maybe he's this way for a reason; people can relate to him because they like to think of themselves being completely perfect and think they would make every right decision if they were in a situation like this. In many senses, this was just a morality play, with Andy Dufresne being entirely good and all the prison officials being completely bad.  I think the only reason why people enjoy this movie so much is that it has the message ""Good things come to those that try and do good with their lives."" However, I didn't think the movie had enough substance to offer any deeper meaning or insight.  The best thing about this movie was it made me realize how great of a movie Forrest Gump is and how great of an actor Tom Hanks is. He made the Forrest Gump character seem to have a fully round personality and allowed us to understand who he was.  He seemed possible.  Andy seems unlikely and not relatable because we never see any reasoning behind his personality. This movie moves people because it is a heroic fable.  It's not a worthless movie experience, but it should have done more with what it already had. To the people that think this is the greatest movie ever made...spare me.

"Home Alone is certainly not the best comedy ever made, however it has to be one of the best Holiday films to watch. Culkin gives a funny, cute personality to his character. The mirror scene is a classic by now and its great fun to watch at Christmas with young kids. Only thing about this movie which holds it back, is that there's really no other time, other than Christmas where you'll want to watch Home Alone. The sequels should not have been made though, one time is enough of watching a young kid practically decapitate 2 adult robbers. 7.5/10",neutral,5,tt0099785
"The rating on IMDb is 5.2/10 right now, I thought I would give it a watch because I was kind of looking forward to see this film. The movie is set in the 1970s, and I really liked the intro from the moment they showed the vintage 'Universal' theme, followed by Brad Pitt and Angelina driving on the coast of France in their Citroen 1967. It sets the vibe for the whole film. I don't really understand the hate, but I admit the film was a bit flawed. On the positive, I really liked the use of the location and the cinematography. I read that Christian Berger used natural lights during filming and you can see the difference, especially with the scenes at night. Beautifully filmed. However, I think the movie is definitely slow. It's the kind of movie where not much is happening but the art speaks for itself. Don't get me wrong, 'By The Sea' includes alcohol, voyeurism, nudity (yes from Angelina too), old cars, great cast... But the pacing is not always well executed. I think it would've been better if we had more background on Angelina Jolie's character and why she's so depressed. We are giving clues here and there, but nothing more than that. The lack of likable characters is probably affecting the movie's performance with audience and critics too. You can see that 'By The Sea' was very personal for Brad and Angelina, and I think it will probably gain more appreciation over the years. If you like a film that is character driven and very well filmed, you might want to give it a shot. Maybe not the kind of movie to watch with grandma, but a nice little gem of a film by Angelina Jolie. 7.5/10",negative,2,tt3707106
"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" is by far the most loved and cherished Movie in cinema history, You just can't escape it, but that might be the problem. Since everybody that has access to the internet have read that sentence or one like it (The Godfather is the best movie ever), It feels like everybody loves it because they're told to, Everybody says they love the godfather and that it's the best movie ever made, but are they just following the crowd? When's the last time you heard someone say the godfather is one of their favorite movies ever? Probably not long ago, when's the last time you heard somebody actually tell you what's so good about it without repeating those same words (Acting, Influential, Classic)? Of course there ARE people who actually explain everything that is great about it and deep dive into analyzing the subtle things it inhabits, but would they have done it if they haven't constantly heard that it's the greatest movie ever? Ok, you can stop screaming at your screen, ""The Godfather Is Terrible! It's so overrated!"" and so on, you don't like it, or are you just following a trend? Look at the ratings of the godfather on any reviewing site (IMDB, Letterboxd etc.) and you'll see that 5/10 stars as the most popular rating and then the numbers of all the other ratings quickly go down, until a random spike at the bottom (1/2 star/1 star), that's because it's become a trend to hate the godfather. People have 2 reactions to hearing that the godfather is the best movie ever made: 1, I know, It's a masterpiece, so amazing, it's a classic. (And they just didn't watch it or didn't pay attention) or: 2, No it's not! It sucks! It's overrated! Worst movie ever! (And they probably didn't watch it either) My point is, you can't find a single review of ""The Godfather"" which hasn't been HEAVILY influenced by the general stigma of this movie, it's either they followed all the others like zombies, or they think they're revolutionaries by saying they don't. Nobody thinks the Godfather is a 1 star/ half a star movie, they just don't. This movie IS amazing, but nobody seems to actually think so.",neutral,5,tt0068646

"I honestly don't know why this movie is touted so much as being the ultimate scifi flick or whatever other tags it's gotten over the past 3 years.  The story was hard to wrap my mind around, but that's perhaps because the explanation for The Matrix itself was done in the middle of the film in the cheesiest manner possible: sitting the hero down and explaining it to him. My mind just blanked it out.  Not only is this device as old as time, but it doesn't involve the audience at all.  It's like we're just listening in.  It would have been better for Neo to actually experience it firsthand and find out exactly what the reality is around him and how it came to be.  I found the FX to be pretty cheesy as well.  I felt like I was watching someone play a video game rather than watching a movie.  The whole concept of the story may be ""deep"" for the latest generation (I'm one step ahead of you folks), but it sounded like contrived dreck to me. 2/10 cuz Keanu's pretty cute, but cuteness does not a good movie make.",negative,2,tt0133093
"The film that began the world famous Hannibal Lector character is a very good one indeed. But I don't think that it lives up to the full quantity of its hype. The two leads deserved the Oscars they won back in 1991 but I don't think that the film deserved any more than that. Nonetheless, the quality of acting from these two leads is outstanding. At 28 she was already an accomplished actress so Jodie Foster perfectly captures the role of hesitantly determined detective Clarice Starling. It's hard to believe that the Hannibal Lector part was offered to so many other actors before Anthony Hopkins was rightfully offered the role. He creates one of the most memorable movie characters of the 20th Century and is brilliant for the part. It's a shame that the same can't be said about the rest of the performances. Ted Levine, one of the most overlooked actors in the past 20 years, never receives any conviction in his role, offers us no motive, and is just plain dull in his part. No background is offered to his character and is much inferior to Ralph Fiennes character in the recently made prequel, `Red Dragon'. Scott Glenn soon gave up `the method' after he proved to be a dud. Apparently, he sat in a room for hours everyday listening to the sounds of killers torturing their victims, so he could prepare for the role. Too bad that what we see on screen is something less professional. One thing that the film does succeed in doing is intensifying scenes so as you don't know what will happen next. It gets gratuitously visceral in some scenes to try and be humane, but just looks gruesome and unattractive. While the story is complex and the film ends so as most people will be satisfied, I didn't see much else of `sheer brilliance' about it. Maybe it's just me or maybe this is a needlessly overrated film. But still, `The Silence of the Lambs' is a very good horror/thriller that well outshines its disastrous sequel `Hannibal'. 7.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0102926

"When I first heard action superemo Corey Yeun was going to work with British actor Jason Statham to make a film called 'The Transporter', my mind started to think 'oh no - yeun has decided to ruin his career'. However as soon as I saw this movie, I was actually quite surprised to see Mr Statham pulling off some very impressive martial art moves however I think it was ruined by constant quick-cutting and MTV-style editing, which reminded me of the overly-cut fight sequences in Rush Hour. The film, which I'm sure will spawn a b-movie version called 'The Courier' and will probably star Steven Seagal or Dolph Lundgren, has Mr Statham a very good Courier with a pretty name, ie: the Transporter. He delivers goods and has very strict rules.  But one day he decides to break his own rules when he discovers he smuggling a pretty Chinese girl around France. The film has lots of good, excellent action sequences - which include impressive fight sequences - but you should never judge a movie based upon its first 10, 20 minutes of action.  This movie slows down, a heck of a lot - to explain its plot. The pretty Chinese girl's dad (whom I'm sure was wearing a lot of make-up) is in cahoots with an evil criminal with a goatee (you knew he was evil because his passport picture) to smuggle lots of Chinese immigrants across France.  Why?  Err, I'm not sure. The film suffers from horrible dialogue, fast-cutting and sequences where I felt Jason Statham's character was never in any danger.

Because the director made the mistake of trying to say that Batman is Bruce Wayne and not Bruce Wayne is Batman. I mean come on the only real reason for that Batman exists is because of Bruce Wayne. Bruce Wayne saw his parents get killed in front of his very eyes and not through the eyes of Batman. Bruce Wayne trained to mental and physical perfection as Bruce Wayne not as Batman. Try to say that the real personality is Batman and not Bruce Wayne than you're taking away the whole motivation behind Batman which is Bruce. Batman is just a mask, a split personality of Bruce Wayne's. If Batman was the real personality then Batman is just an i**t in a suit.

"The movie is often described as a masterpiece, but to me, it feels like a very ordinary serial killer story wrapped in an exaggerated package. The plot follows a formula we've seen many times before-a young agent chasing a disturbed killer, with the added gimmick of another killer offering advice. There's nothing particularly groundbreaking about it once you look past the film's reputation. What makes it worse are the performances, which feel overacted and artificial. Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter is iconic to many, but his exaggerated style borders on theatrical parody rather than delivering a truly terrifying figure. Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling, meant to be a determined and relatable heroine, often comes across as stiff and unnatural. The emotional connection is missing, and most of the interactions feel scripted rather than real. Visually, the film is decent but not memorable, and while the score tries to create tension, it often feels forced. Instead of offering a deep psychological exploration, the film leans heavily on clichés and surface-level shocks. For a movie so highly praised, it delivers little more than a standard crime story with performances that never let you forget you are watching actors, not real people.

"I should have listened to my instincts which were telling me that I could not take seriously a movie where a guy in a rubber halloween costume was flying around skyscrapers beating up the bad guys. At least the original by Tim Burton and Michael Keaton as Batman was a bit tongue in cheek as the TV series was but the Dark Knight took itself far too seriously and the result was embarrassing. Why does Batman have this gruff stereotypical voice? Then as his alter ego Bruce Wayne it disappears. Also, Michael Caine addressing Christian Bale as Master Wayne is also a bit laughable. Anyway, too much crash, bang, wallop for my liking. Yes, special effects were good but so was Blade Runner and that felt more atmospheric and substantial than this rubbish. Ashame, because Christopher Nolan's last film The Prestige was hugely enjoyable with great script and cinematography. Also Bale was in his element here but as Batman he was quite simply pathetic with that stupid voice. My rating is 6/10 for effects only and I wouldn't waste your hard earned on this rubbish.

A movie you want to watch once and probably rewind and find some of the neat scenes and replay. 6/10",neutral,6,tt1179034
"Ive never seen a movie with such a gap between the first part and the second... Its like if its not even the same movie, i dont understand. 45 minutes of very good story with clever plot , decent characters, the movie was about to be a 8.5/10, a solid movie. But all of a sudden the writers decided the plot is over, we're gonna add a chinese story to it and let actions movie finish the last 45 minutes... Everything was too much, he is James Bond + rambo combined
In the end the movie is a 7/10 thanks to a strong start. I would still recomend it, but to people loving action and fight scene.",neutral,5,tt0293662
"In the realm of cinematic brilliance, Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather stands tall and unyielding, a true masterpiece that transcends time and leaves an indelible mark on the landscape of filmmaking. With its compelling narrative, masterful storytelling, and impeccable craftsmanship, The Godfather deserves nothing short of a perfect 10 rating. At its core, The Godfather is a deeply immersive exploration of power, loyalty, and the intricate dynamics of family. Set against the backdrop of organized crime, the film delves into the Corleone family's underworld empire, led by the enigmatic and iconic figure of Don Vito Corleone, portrayed flawlessly by Marlon Brando. Brando's mesmerizing performance breathes life into a character whose presence resonates in every frame, commanding respect and fascination. The themes of The Godfather reverberate with intensity throughout the film, subtly weaving their threads into the tapestry of the narrative. Through the complex interplay of honor, betrayal, and tradition, the film delves into the price one must pay for power and the consequences that come with the pursuit of dominance. The exploration of the duality of human nature, where love and violence coexist, adds layers of depth to the characters, making them compelling and multi-dimensional. Visually, The Godfather is a feast for the eyes. Coppola's expert direction and the artistry of cinematographer Gordon Willis transport viewers to the heart of 1940s New York and rural Sicily, enveloping them in a world that is both gritty and grand. The use of shadow and light creates a palpable sense of atmosphere, reflecting the moral shades of the characters and heightening the tension in each scene. Every frame is meticulously crafted, showcasing the attention to detail that elevates the film to the realm of visual poetry. The Godfather's haunting and iconic score, composed by Nino Rota, further enhances the emotional depth of the film. From the solemn tones that accompany the family's intimate moments to the swelling crescendos that underscore moments of violence and tragedy, the music resonates with the audience, becoming a character in its own right. The ensemble cast delivers performances that are nothing short of extraordinary. From Al Pacino's transformation from the innocent Michael Corleone to a ruthless heir, to James Caan's explosive portrayal of the hot-tempered Sonny, each actor breathes life into their respective roles, bringing authenticity and complexity to the characters that inhabit this world. The Godfather stands as a testament to the power of storytelling and the enduring impact of cinema. It captivates audiences with its rich character development, compelling themes, and impeccable videography. With its flawless execution and unforgettable performances, this film has rightfully earned its place as a timeless classic. In conclusion, The Godfather is a cinematic gem that surpasses expectations, delivering a captivating narrative infused with powerful themes and mesmerizing visuals. It deserves every accolade it has received and remains an unparalleled masterpiece in the realm of filmmaking. A true testament to the art form, The Godfather deserves a resounding 10/10 rating.",positive,10,tt0068646
"First of all, lets get one thing straight: Christopher Lambert makes B-movies. I've never seen him in anything that wasn't a B-movie, and as far as I know, he hasn't done one single non-B-movie for his entire career. This particular B-movie, however, is more interesting and entertaining than that of the typical B-movie; the story revolves around a few people in the not-too-distant future(the year 2017, if I remember correctly) who are in a futuristic gigantic prison, which is said to be impossible to break out of. So, naturally they try to break out. The plot is OK, it moves along at a pretty good pace, never really loses your interest or bores you. The acting is all bad, but what do you expect from a B-movie? It has plenty of action to keep you distracted from the horrid acting, so it probably won't bother that many people. The characters are all cliches, but, again, what do you expect? The action and sci-fi parts of the film are reasonably entertaining, and pretty good for a B-movie. The film depicts a gloomy futuristic fascist world, but that's nothing that hasn't been seen many times before. All in all, a pretty typical B-movie, just a notch higher in quality than most others. I recommend it to fans of action/sci-fi B-movies and/or Christopher Lambert. 6/10",neutral,6,tt0106950
"Shawshank Redemption is one of those infamous movies you never stop hearing about if you are a crazed movie fanatic. I've been through the entire top 250 list up and down and this is going back and fourth between #2 and #3 struggling with Lord of the Rings: The Retrun of the King. I had to see this movie to see what all the fuss is about. Based on Stephen King's novel, The Shawshank Redemption is a terrific adaptation of his book. The acting, I mean don't get me started. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were perfectly casted and fit so well together. What I mean in my title to my summary is, I felt that I could relate. This reminded me so much of my friendship with my best friend, because her and I are so close and would do anything for each other. Even wait until the end of time just to hang out and talk again. I felt this story also brought up major important points, what does a convict do after so many years in prison? Pretty much a good job is out of the question, same with a decent place. Your family might disown you and everything you knew was in that prison. It's sort of like being shoved from a lake to an ocean and you're drowning with no life preserver. This movie actually got me thinking about that. Also there is the final notion of the court systems, because we are also dealing with Tim Robbin's life. He keeps claiming his innocence and no one will listen to him or believe him. I felt awful for him, I know there are a lot of men and women in prison who are innocent and are paying for other people's crimes. I would highly recommend The Shawshank Redemption, I believe it's better than Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. So watch it and understand this movie, it's important. This should be watched by everyone and you get out of the movie what you bring into it. 10/10",positive,10,tt0111161
"Saw 'The Open House' on Netflix a while ago, being fond of horror/thriller regardless of budget (even if not my favourite genre) and being intrigued somewhat by the idea. Being behind on my film watching and reviewing, with a long to watch and review list that keeps getting longer, it took me a while to get round to reviewing it. Unfortunately, despite not reading any reviews purposefully before watching, am going to have to agree with all the reviewers who hated 'The Open House'. A film that started off pretty good, but ran out of steam very quickly and rapidly got worse by a second half that makes one not want to keep watching. Never judge a film without seeing the whole thing and wanted to give 'The Open House', so gave it a fair chance. As said, 'The Open House' started off pretty promising. Dylan Minnette and Piercey Dalton give surprisingly good performances considering the material, especially Minnette. The soundtrack has some nice moments (i.e. ""Silent Night""), when it isn't being intrusive and annoying. However, so much brings 'The Open House' down. The rest of the cast struggle to do much with so little to do and the direction is so phoned in and pedestrian, one gets the sense that the director showed no interest in the film at all. Too much of the soundtrack is intrusive and annoying, made worse by the excessive and obvious sound effects that just cheapens the mood. The film looks drab generally and like it was made in haste. Where 'The Open House' most underwhelms is the writing and story. The writing is incredibly lazy, it's awkward in dialogue, very confused as a result of not tying things up or going into full detail and doesn't feel complete. The story suffers from a very limp pace, apparent early on and gets slower and slower until an interminably dragged out second half. It further suffers from feeling too much like a short film stretched out with a lot of useless padding. A few of the characters are reasonably likeable but the inconsistent and illogical motivations bring them down. For a film billed as a horror, though it's more a thriller with horror elements, there is very little interesting and nothing remotely scary. They are too few and are far too predictable, anaemic and weakly timed to make impact, with the dull pacing and obvious sound effects cheapening them significantly. In terms of the thriller elements, 'The Open House' doesn't engage let alone thrill, the start intrigued by feels wasted by how quickly everything runs out of steam. Worst of all is the ending, which is so abrupt, unresolved and incomplete that one struggles to even consider it an ending, the film just ends and leaves one scratching their heads in confusion and feeling cheated. Overall, the potential was there but the execution far from was. Really bad, unless you're curious about seeing it it's best to keep this house closed. 2/10 Bethany Cox",negative,2,tt7608028
"The Shawshank Redemption isn't, in my opinion, even in the top 50 greatest films of all time, let alone number 1. But, I can also see why it's the highest user rated film of all-time on IMDB. This is just an all-around great movie. The themes of triumph in the face of adversity and believing the impossible are easy to digest, and the actors give emotional, Oscar-worthy performances. Even if this movie isn't your favorite, it's hard to objectively find fault with any one element of The Shawshank Redemption. It's safe, but it's still for adults. It leaves you feeling good at the end. It takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. Its characters are complex. It appeals to every type of viewer on some level. It's phenomenally acted. This classic is rated higher than any other movie on IMDB because it manages to capture general audiences in a significant way, and it stays grounded with a focus on characters and relationships during hardships. It's not my favorite movie. Not even close. It didn't leave the same impact on me as other films. But I genuinely enjoyed The Shawshank Redemption, as does everyone. And I think that's the key. 9/10.",positive,9,tt0111161
"RELEASED 2001 and directed by Peter Jackson, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" adapts the first part of JRR Tolkien's popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The story starts in the homeland of the Hobbits (innocent, diminutive humanoids) where Frodo (Elijah Wood) is instructed by the noble wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to quickly leave the Shire with the powerful One Ring in his possession. Gandalf and Frodo are later accompanied by seven others, the titular 'Fellowship of the Ring,' to take the ring to the only place it can be destroyed, the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. The rest of the main cast include Sean Astin (Sam), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), Sean Bean (Boromir), Christopher Lee (Saruman), Orlando Bloom (Legolas), John Rhys-Davies (Gimli) and Hugo Weaving (Elrond). This three-hour fantasy features a diverse cast of colorful characters, quaint beings and settings, moments of genuine wonder, dark ee-vil creatures, high adventure, thrilling brutal action, a superb score, magnificent locations (forests, mountains, rivers, etc.), and wondrous CGI sets. The film LOOKS and SOUNDS so great that it'd be sinful to give it a lower rating. There are problems, however, at least for those who aren't uber-fans of Tolkien. For one, the opening is hindered by prologue that is overlong and convoluted, not to mention unnecessary. The bulk of it could've been conveyed later via flashback, which they do a little bit anyway. Secondly, the story takes forever to build any drive. Thirdly, except for maybe Frodo and Gandalf, the characters are shallow and I didn't care much what happened to them. Fourthly, main protagonists getting seriously wounded and everyone else expressing their melodramatic concern gets redundant. Fifthly, there are only two females in the main cast (Liv Tyler as Arwen, a half-Elf princess, and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, a royal Elf); unfortunately, their parts aren't much more than glorified cameos. ""Mythica: A Quest for Heroes"" (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $93 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. Despite these negatives, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is the best of the trilogy and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, especially Tolkien fans. THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 58 minutes and was shot in New Zealand. GRADE: B/B- (6.5/10)",neutral,5,tt0120737
"Fight Club was one of the best films of 1999, Brad Pitt is excellent as Tyler Durden, Ed Norton is equally as good as the narrator. From the Visually stunning opening sequence to the credits, fight club had me glued to the screen, it was not at all hard to follow, and the violence wasn't as bad as i'd expected it to be. Alot of people over-analyse films like Fight Club saying that they will trigger copycat violence, i think these people should stop looking to the movies for excuses to explain why such tragic things happen in our society.

"I saw this film (at the theater) as a kid in the 70' upon its initial release. And, of course, was impressed. Marlon Brando is my favorite actor and I like all other actors in the film. Everything in this movie is just great (anybody noticed Gordon Willis' work?). I can understand why all the fine young Americans consider this to be the best movie in the history. It's American (it seems that nobody knows that cinema exist ""also"" outside the USA, in fact a 100 years of great art of film-making), it's ""kill-kill-kill"" (main theme in American movies), it's about family (another main theme), it's entertaining (nothing to think about, let's go to the movies, have fun, popcorn and stuff) and so on. The fact is that The Godfather is a great American movie for Americans. I like very well made films and I like this movie, but it is still ""just"" a MOVIE. If you are among those who consider this movie the best in the history, you should start watching the real great ones, masterpieces that can teach you something about yourself or even change your life. Ever heard of Kurosawa, Bunuel, Tarkovski, Bergman, Fellini? Not to mention American directors (if you hate 'foreign' films, forgot to read subtitles etc.): Welles, Kubrick, Altman, Lumet... And the Japanese (Ozu, Mizoguchi, Kinugasa), Chinese, British (Schlesinger, Russell, Parker, Greenaway) and so on and so on. Please, go and educate yourself. Your mind, heart and soul will thank you for that. All you need is to be curious and open-minded. I consider myself lucky to have a chance to see at least 100 'better' films (in every aspect) than The Godfather. And I have still a long way to go. Good luck to you all in your 'search' for the art of cinema. My vote for The Godfather: 9/10.",positive,9,tt0068646
"One of my most anticipated movies of all time no joke, is this movie I'm reviewing, The Snowman. I was pumped out of my mind to see this movie. The trailer looked intriguing, the concept, I thought was really unique, and it looked like a movie I would enjoy. Little did 13 year old Austin know, this movie was terrible. Watching it was a waste of time. This is around the time where I just found my interest in film, and this movie really disappointed a new coming film lover. This movie is probably one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. I paid my own hard earned money to see this movie, and it was such a waste of $10. I watched it a second time last week to get prepared for this review, and I still think this movie is terrible. The first 30 minutes of this movie was not that bad, it actually intrigued and interested me. But the rest of the movie was terrible and the first 30 minutes don't make up for it. I can compliment this movie on only 2 things, (but it won't change my score for this movie) the acting and cinematography. The acting is actually kind of good, especially from Michael Fassbender. The cinematography is beautiful, I feel like I'm in the snowy landscape of Norway (the place where the movie is set). And other than those aspects, I thought the movie was terrible. My biggest issue with this movie is how confusing it is. A lot of the events that happen don't add up and the conclusion feels out of place because everything before it felt out of place. For the majority of the movie, we are scratching our heads because we don't know what is going on. I've read from some articles that about 10 to 20 percent of the movie didn't get a chance to get film because of schedule problems. Maybe that 20 percent of movie could've fixed the final film's confusion. The main characters in this movie are bland as mayonaise. They are not interesting at all and we have to go along with them and witness them solve this mystery. At the end of the movie, we're not cheering for them because they are not likeable at all because they are boring. Another thing that frustrated me is the choice of cutting to another event when something remotely interesting happened. It really bothered me and that really ticked me off. There is an ""action"" scene at the end of the movie that didn't really make sense at all because the way it is shown on the screen is so rancid, it confused the poop out of me. And the main character's finger gets cut off in that scene, and it doesn't make sense on how it happened. Just watch that scene on youtube, it'll remind you of an Olivier Megaton movie. The ending scene of the movie also tries to set up a sequel, and in my mind, I was like, ""the sequel's not gonna happen"".

David Fincher's adaptation of Chuck Palahnuik's slightly above average story comes leaps and bounds ahead of the simplistic source material and delivers a message to an entire generation. Edward Norton delivers my favourite performance of anyone ever. His dry narration really brings to life the doom and gloom of everyday life. Brad Pitt oozes charisma as Tyler Durden and makes you question your thoughts on society. It's great that the audience doesn't question Tyler when he rants about them not becoming movie stars when the line's coming from megastar Brad Pitt, he must be good.

"If there was ever a film to label as ""overrated"", it would be The Dark Knight. If there was ever another film to label as ""overrated"", it would be Inception. I just don't understand what it is about Christopher Nolan's films but they have the tendency to receive large amounts of unwarranted and undeserved praise. While they are very well-made films, they are for the most part nothing more than entertaining popcorn flicks (Memento being the one exception). Popcorn flicks of the up-most quality but nothing truly memorable or deep. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, lets get on with the review. Now, basically, Inception is a heist film with a twist. The heists take place inside of a dream, thus allowing for some creative and tricky special effects to be pulled off. These effects are pretty amusing to watch, most notably a scene where the gravity of a hallway is shifting and the two actors are duking it out amidst the gravity shifts, and this makes for some impressive-looking chaos. The story while somewhat original, wasn't pulled off as smoothly as it could have been in my opinion. There were just far too many plot holes that you could drive a tank through. Now with a certain proper ending, these plot holes would diminish, but Nolan has yet to confirm just what the ending means so the plot holes are left intact. If you want a better idea of what I mean by that, PM me. Acting for the most part is good and gets the job done. Just don't expect anything Oscar-caliber here. If there was one stand-out performance in Inception, I would definitely say it's from Leo Dicaprio. The guy proves time and time again that he's one of the better young actors working right now. The rest of the cast gives passable performances, but nothing special. Michael Caine is wasted, and I feel the only reason he was hired was to get his name on the box. Not much needs to be said about the special effects. They're some of the best yet, and at times even creative. Possibly the strongest aspect of the film, next to the effects, is the musical score. Inception has one of the best scores in recent memory. My hat is off to Hans Zimmer. The effects, score, and flawed but intriguing story come together in making Inception a very enjoyable and entertaining film. It's definitely smarter than your average popcorn flick, but at the end of the day it's still just a popcorn flick. Nothing more, nothing less. It lacks the emotional punch and attention to detail that made District 9 so great (now that's a true masterpiece, and one of the greatest sci fi films ever made). I give Inception 7.5/10 and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun film that will also make them think a little bit.",neutral,5,tt1375666

"So there's a trend lately with all these 1/10 reviews bashing IW, especially by saying it doesn't belong in the top 250. 
Firstly they don't understand how IMDB's rating system works, fanboyism can't get movies in the top 250. 
Secondly, and this is the funniest part, at the same time they think this movie is not better than e.g. LOTR:TTT (I don't either) they also with their 1/10 votes think IW is WORSE than The Room (3.6/10) or Britney Spears' Crossroads (3.4/10). They must think these movies are awesome compared to IW.

I think we need to take a moment here to look at what is going on here. Most critics are always looking for a masterpiece, or an epic. Movies like Gladiator, which are amazing, but not all movies have to be like this. This movie is meant for sheer entertainment, that is all. If you smile, get into the story a little, think the action kicks ass, and have an all around great fun time, then I think it's a good movie. That's what has happened here. I went to see this movie knowing its a hated piece of work. I mean, look at its raiting on IMDB-4.5/10. That's pretty bad. I think this is a movie that most people won't like. There is a certain crowd that will, and if you like the movie, you're in that crowd. Let me give you a list of the best parts of the movie: Vin Diesel: He is like Arnold for the Millenium. He ROCKS!!! The hot chicks: They are all over this movie, we even get a little girl on girl kissing! The cars: I'm sitting in the theater drooling over the amazing race cars in this movie. The action: It's intense, and NON-STOP. So, do you like those things I just listed? Well then, The Fast and the Furious is a movie you HAVE to see. Let me say it again: The Fast and the Furious is something I haven't seen for a long time. It's pure entertainment. And for that reason, I give The Fast and the Furious a 10/10.",neutral,5,tt0232500
"What can be said about this film that hasn't already been said? Its been making a buzz for the absolutely wrong reasons. Yes, that ending. I wonder what was going through the filmmakers mind when drafting that ending. I won't say what happened but I must say that ending alone brings the films rating and quality down by a lot. What you get with The Turning is atmospheric nothingness for a full 90 minutes. Only saving grace, are the performances from its actors. The film is about a woman who becomes a governess for a child who lives at an estate. Once there she realizes that the girls disturbed older brother is also back from boarding school. Soon she starts realizing that the children are not what they seem and that there is a ghostly presence in the house related to the wicked former horse riding instructor who stayed at the house. The woman is curious to find out more about all this while protecting the young girl she is tasked to serve. The best part of the film is definitely the acting of Mackenzie Davis and especially Brooklynn Prince. Prince was tremendous in The Florida Project and she brought a lively energy to this film, and it was needed. Finn Wolfhard is plain annoying in this film and is now in that annoying teenager phase of life. The film opens with the announcement of the death of Kurt Cobain because? The film falls for the usual horror trope pitfalls that plague films today. Jump scares that are so predictable and just not scary. A plot that brings up different issues vaguely but fails to focus on any of it. Above all, the worst offender is the ending. The ending was heading in a decent direction before doing a fake out that made absolutely no sense. I could hear the theater become perplexed. After that, guess what? Another twist! Not only that but then it fades to black extremely abruptly. I don't know how they came to this conclusion or what the artistic merit to it might have been but it was resoundingly awful. A mediocre horror film at best made infinitely worst by its ridiculously stupid ending. 4/10",negative,4,tt7510346
"I awarded this film 9/10 because I just can't endorse this film being the #1 film of all time. However, it's one of the most satisfying theatrical experiences i've ever undergone. It's actually incredible what Nolan's achieved with this film. Batman Begins was terrific, and i'd insist on seeing that before The Dark Knight as it repositions the Batman character from a campy one-dimensional characateur to a complex, fascinating, credible and multi-dimensional subject. Having established the core elements of this character with BB, the Dark Knight is a terrific bit of character exposition bound up in one of the best action movies i've ever seen. The Joker was apparently always intended to be the anti-Batman. Nolan really explores that in this film. Harvey Dent and Gotham City serve as metaphors and Litmus tests for the 'Good/Evil' dichotomy that are central. The grotesque nature of all the characters is handled so superbly, that you forget this is an adaptation of a comic and almost suggests the comics themselves should be revisited as serious pieces of literature. This film surpasses the comic book ethic and becomes more like a modern Shakespearean Tragedy. The genius of it is that it works as a comic book adaptation (with satisfying sincerity to the subject matter) but also works as an independent study. Realistically, there are better character studies out there, but those tend to be those that focus all energy on that study, at the expense of satisfying the other other requirements of film. This contains some of the best action, effects, set-pieces that i've seen in a film. Some of the heist scenes and chase scenes beat anything i've seen elsewhere. Most heist movies fall into the trap of being contrived, smug and pseudo-unpredictable (e.g. Ocean's 11). This one feels like something conceived of a reckless mind. The film's sequences really feel the product of an impulsive and reckless psychopath and adeptly cultivates the feeling of impotence of the hero. Brilliant. The Joker genuinely feels like an invulnerable nemesis. As an action movie this is really outstanding. There is some terrific violent scenes and stunts that will delight any thrill junkie, and there was no overdependance on CGI. The script was impeccable and i'm sure will work with all levels of viewer without being patronising. The performances were terrific. Bale and Ledger steal the show, though the latter really is brilliant. Watching this you get a real sense of shame that you won't ever see him reprise the role. Ledger is absolutely magnetic. Hilarious, terrifying, menacing but also tragic. He really does blow Jack Nicholson out of the water and the third time you see him on screen you'll feel nostalgic about his loss. The supporting cast are exemplary (I was impressed by Eckhart too, having previously written him off), and you get the same quality performance from the likes of Oldman, Freeman etc. as you'd expect. The cinematography is superb. I saw this on the IMAX (do so if you can) and it was stunning, the relevance of the film aided by the portrayal of a real Gotham. The pace and plot are terrific and keep you gripped for the duration. There is also a healthy dose of humour and social commentary that is all impressively appropriate. Even the soundtrack is absolutely on point. I can't hail this as the best film i've ever seen, but it so so good and if the next can improve on this, then that may well have a justified claim. It's a true shame that Ledger as Joker won't be involved.",positive,9,tt0468569
"I can't say i'm a huge fan of the Batman franchise. Since i have basically no interest in comic books i'm usually also quite free from expectations based on comics. I do enjoy a good comic book adaption though so i don't mind watching a movie like Batman Begins. Seeing as how the actors and director were both talented i must admit my hopes were rather high. Unfortunately this movie is ultimately a disappointment. I love movies based on comic books. Which might sound strange considering i don't like comic books themselves. And maybe it's strange, but still there is something about the over-the-top playfulness that should always be an element in comic-book adaptations that appeals to me. Christopher Nolan who directed Batman Begins has not done anything like it before, but then again neither had Bryan Singer before he made X-men, and just look how well that turned out. It's my firm belief that a truly talented director can make almost any kind of movie. And has Nolan succeeded? Well, both yes and no i would say. The first part of this movie was very much to my liking. The background of how Batman came to be Batman, as well as the background to where he gets all his lovely toys and his neat cave. Christian Bale is a good actor and the supporting cast is also excellent so there is no problem with the fact that there is not much action in the first half. Rather the problems start when the action starts... The action scenes are dark, messy and not very well done at all. Effects-laden and with a lot of kicking and punching without us seeing very much of what's going on. Maybe a testament to Nolan not being used to action-films? In the end there is just too much lacking from this film for it to be truly successful. The script feels like it's been re-written somewhere in the middle. Perhaps the studio thought people wouldn't see a Batman-movie without constant action-scenes? In the end it feels like two movies in one, and the first part is by far the best. The actors are superb and most of them do an excellent job. Bale is great as Batman (the best Batman so far alongside Michael Keaton), Michael Cane is enjoyable as his butler and Liam Neeson offer as solid a performance as ever. So what's missing? Well apart from the story more or less disappearing in all the explosions in the end i really miss the super-villain in this movie. There is just not enough madness to go around. To make a long story short this is not a failure as such. Rather it's more the feeling that it could have been so much more that bugs me. A promising start is dragged down by inefficient action-scenes and i feel this movie deserved better. It's a 6/10 for the effort.",neutral,6,tt0372784
"I didn't really think this film would have any effect on me, I thought it would just be another police cat and mouse story in which the two detectives hate each other at the start of the film and then end up becoming bestest buds by the end credits but it isn't that all. I wouldn't classify this as a horror film although when I was watching it, I felt as though I couldn't relax until the end credits came up on screen. I think the person who wrote this must have a pretty vivid ( and not to mention disturbed) imagination. The deaths aren't just gory with a few lashings of tomatoe ketchup strewn around the 'corpse', no, I can take the blood and the huge obese man covered in stitches and bruises, its the actual form of killing and toture that I am amazed at. I mean where on earth did the writer come up with these disgusting forms of torture?? The acting was ok, although I often feel that Morgan Freeman plays the same character again and again. I'm disapointed that Kevin Spacey wasn't listed in the opening credits because, although short, his performance, once again, was magnificent and totally believable as John Doe. If you like really imaginative deaths and lashings of gore, you'll like Se7en for its brilliantly directed portrayal of the dark and sinister underworld. Se7en is clever and stylishly directed and I am glad I watched it but I would never sit through it again. 6/10",neutral,6,tt0114369
"Far less interesting than the first, and this road trip is honestly getting a wee bit long and tedious. A bunch of characters try to find each other, then they battle some and that's basically it. It goes nowhere. Gollum is almost but not quite as annoying as Jar-Jar and the talking trees are plain ridiculous. The hobbits are still charisma-less and the dwarf is way too much this time around in his desperate side-kick attempts. The last hour is worth the ticket, though. The final battle is tremendous, but the two first hours are at least one too much considering nothing really happens. Rating: 5/10",neutral,5,tt0167261
"This is a top 250 movie?!?  Brad Pitt's acting is shallow, stereotypical, and not nuanced.  He does the California surfer-dude routine throughout the entire movie as though some uneducated simpleton dolt could wind up with his job...sorry, but I don't think so.  The plot line relies on a connect...the...dots methodology -- contrived, and largely predictable with action interspersed with banal social dialogue.  I gave this 4/10 mostly for the fine acting of Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman.  Very silly -- Brad Pitt's acting had me laughing...and not in a good way.   In defense of Mr. Pitt, I think he was badly miscast since I've seen other movies in which he does at least a respectable job.",negative,4,tt0114369

Fight Club is one of Edward Norton's best roles since American History X, and personally it's one of my favorite movies as of now.

"I liked the original and this one surprised me. While not every story was top notch one stands out as original and had great direction. Tape 1-Phase 1 Clinical Trials, This was a decent Ghost Story but was not very memorable. Did have a few scares and was fun to watch.6/10 Tape 2-A Ride In The Park, This one was fun and creative. Wasn't scary but I did like the set up and actually seeing the perspective of a Zombie was real cool. It has a lot of gore and while I don't really like zombies this one was nice to watch. 7/10. Tape 3-Safe Haven, This is the best out of the bunch. Details an investigative team going into a religious cult and the outcome is insane and over the top. Has the best pacing and while there aren't many jump scares, it really manages to creep you out the whole time through. Also it is directed by the Mo Brothers who also did the ABC's Of Death letter L which was one of the best on that horror movie and did Macabre which I will link my review to that movie in the end. 9/10 Tape 4-Alien Abduction, Most people consider this the weakest of the bunch but Tape 1 was the weakest in my opinion. This has a nice set up and the effects are good for a short. Wasn't creepy like Safe Haven but it kept me interested in till the end. 8/10 Tape 49- The main story about two private investigators watching the tapes in a house where their looking for a kid from the first VHS. It was OK and while not the best story, it did give us a reason for watching the tapes which is nice. 6/10 Overall this movie gets a 7/10.

"Batman raises the stakes in his bourgeois war on crime. With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent, Batman sets out to dismantle the remaining criminal organizations that plague the city streets. The partnership proves to be effective, but they soon find themselves prey to a reign of chaos unleashed by a rising criminal mastermind known to the terrified citizens of Gotham as The Joker... The Dark Knight is nothing more then an average super hero movie. I find it to be completely overrated and I couldn't disagree more with those who consider this to be worthy of the top250 IMDb list. First of all, after a while, the story gets boring and dull because there's too much politics and bureaucracy involved, and it's not that I don't enjoy a rich plot, it's just that it all seems very contrived and pointless and it drags out way too long. They injected a lot of philosophical questions and moral dilemmas in an attempt to diverge a little from the usual cut and dry, straight-forward superhero movie but, they should've sticked to what the genre usually offers, entertainment and action, because the end product is a very uneven piece of work. The actions scenes were disappointing mainly because of the editing and successive cuts that make it hard to really see what's going on, this happens particularly in the fighting sequences. Now, regarding the acting, I did enjoy Ledger's portrayal of The Joker, but I think it's miles away from being an Oscar-worthy performance and I'm sure his tragic death contributed to his winning, at least to a certain extent. Christian Bale, wasn't exactly bad either but, his cold and distant Bruce Wayne could never compete with Robert Downey Jr's witty and sarcastic Tony Stark for instance. Obviously the two movies have different tones, but the point I'm making is, Bale lacks charisma. Aaron Eckhart was fine as Harvey-Dent; what really threw me off was the fact that his character went from being incorruptible to killing innocent people without so much as a twitch ,all this because his lover, Rachel Dawes, gets killed. This is poor and incoherent writing. Morgan Freeman, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Michael Caine have minor roles and aren't worth mentioning. It's really something, the level of hype around this film, and the favored public reaction, the thing is, The Dark Knight doesn't know what it wants to be and tries to hard, sometimes it's a comic adaptation, and then it turns into a deep philosophical exercise and things don't work that way. It lacks coherence and a strong screenplay. 5/10",neutral,5,tt0468569

"The Dark Knight defines its generation. Its story is potent with emotion and excitement. The script isn't artistic, but it's genuine entertainment with significant substance. The protagonists have their ideals challenged by the Joker. Each character represents a different vision of justice (order, chance, chaos) and each position is convincing. Furthermore, the plot is a natural progression. Batman reduces crime, but it evolves and creates a rising panic. Bruce Wayne's relationships are strained, he loses loved ones, and the ending is bittersweet. Plus, the acting is electric. Heath Ledger provides an all-time performance, elevating The Dark Knight to a legendary level. Meanwhile, The Dark Knight is a technical force. It has Nolan's consistent craftsmanship, but goes above and beyond. The cinematography has meaning, using arcs and upside-down shots to convey madness. The sound is sleek yet gripping, with symbolic touches. The editing seamlessly blends storylines. The epic music is measured and heightens suspense. Additionally, the Joker's costume is nearly as iconic as Ledger's performance. Lastly, the effects are truly grandiose, actually vertically flipping semitrucks and blowing up entire hospital buildings. Overall, The Dark Knight is a symphony of skilled entertainment and a film for all audiences. Writing: 9/10

"Wow... I don't think there will ever be another duo as powerful and encapsulating onscreen as Pacino and Brando in this film. I actually had no idea Michael was played by Pacino, until near the end of the film when I thought ""wow this guy is such a phenomenal actor I wonder if he's done any other big movies"" then I realized it was Pacino. There is a reason he's known as possibly one of the greatest actors of all time. This is also my favorite Brando performance I have seen so far. They carried this movie from start to finish. However this movie is not perfect. They should call him Francis ""crossfade"" Coppola because it felt like half the scene transitions in this film were cross fades. Some of these cross fades felt impactful, a lot of them felt unnecessary. There were also some clear problems with the edit in the second half, after the death of someone in a car explosion it cuts immediately to over a year later and completely ignores this plot point the rest of the film. I would've loved a scene in between showing how Michael changed during that time. I also felt like the next time jump also felt abrupt and a bit random. There were also some clear problems with some of the ADR as well as some of the fight/death scenes. Some of the deaths felt very 70s. Several of Brando's lines, as good as his performance was, were unfortunately really hard to understand with his underbite, but his performance carried it through. Back to the good stuff. The sets and period props were great, the score was great, and the suspense in several scenes was thrilling. The cinematography was also spectacular. Ultimately the thing that stands out the most to me is how well this movie does with characters, performances, and story which is really what drives it to be an absolutely timeless tale.

"I really tried to like this film, but it didn't completely work for me. Granted it is very well made, with stylish shots and striking locations, the music is good, Scorsese's direction is excellent(though he has directed much better than here) and Jack Nicholson does do his best work in years here. However, I never did find the movie that compelling, the film does move in a somewhat mannered manner and there are parts that are either rushed, underdeveloped or even predictable- the sex scene was laughable. Also, I think The Departed is overlong, and the ending was very underwhelming. Then there is the script, while it has been lauded for its complexity, maybe I am being harsh but I found it too complex and needlessly convoluted too. In terms of acting, it was okay but nothing exceptional Nicholson excepted. Leonardo DaCaprio plays a different role but for me it is a role that does not suit him, while I didn't see anything special in Mark Wahlberg either. Out of the cameos, Ray Winstone's comes off best, while Matt Damon is the real weak link being very blank faced and monotone throughout. Overall, not terrible but a disappointment. As far as Scorsese movies go, I would put Goodfellas, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull over this any day. 5/10 Bethany Cox",neutral,5,tt0407887
"It's 2020, there was nothing else I felt like watching, so here I was watching Godfather for the 3rd time in my life. I thought I would just let it play in the background while i browsed my phone. At the first scene, I watched & listened to the man sitting before Don Corleone, fully decided that I would just hear him out and then get back to browsing my phone. But when Don Corleone appeared, all that changed. I was hypnotized.
He commanded the screen.
I could not look away. It was impossible.
I had completely forgotten about my phone. I sat there thinking to myself, how can this be? It's 2020 and this film is even better than I remembered it. I've watched this before already, I've watched countless of critically acclaimed films since then, why is this film having this kind of effect on me now? For close to 3 hrs, I had forgotten where I was. All I knew was that I was part of their family.

"Pros: -Interesting film overall, lots of symbolism in the story
-Anti-capitalism and anti-consumerism theme
-Psychological thriller aspect, plot twists
-Lots of high octane underground fighting
-Great lead actors Cons: -Scenes can be too random sometimes, attention grabbing for no reason
-The hyper masculinity and toxic masculinity aspect, and encourages predatory behavior
-Encouragement of toxic relationships
-Can get a little too violent sometimes for no reason
-Pushing the idea of terrorism and cultism
-Ending just wasn't satisfying or made much sense The movie started off very interesting and there was a good build up but the movie starts to drag somewhere halfway through the film and the ending just wasn't satisfying to me. I think the movie has some good symbolism and meanings to it (such as the anti capitalism theme, making you think outside the box and realize our lives are shaped by rich men and politicians in suits, and that there is more meaning to life than working your 9-5 job, and that you should live without fears or worries), but I also think there were some bad meanings (encourages toxic masculinity and hyper masculinity, giving the idea to be a real man you have to be ruthless and violent, and it can encourage domestic terrorism). I think most of the people giving the movie 10/10 are mostly men, it is indeed the type of movie most men love (kind of like Kill Bill, lots of meaningless violence and has a cult classic aspect to it with a lot of catchy phrases). I think the movie is pretty good and interesting to watch, and it makes me think more about life and think outside the box more.. but I feel the movie is indeed overhyped as ""the best movie ever"", and I just think the story kind of doesn't go anywhere halfway through the film and there's too much unnecessary hyper masculinity which I think can send a wrong message. I'm not trying to be ""woke"", I just don't think this movie is a perfect 10/10, so I give it 7/10 because it I enjoyed it but I wouldn't rewatch it more than twice, story just didn't go anywhere. I could see why it's a cult classic, it does appeal to certain people. Just like Kill Bill, it's fun to watch but I don't think it's the best movie ever, but some people love it and it's a Hollywood cult classic.",positive,10,tt0137523
"This movie had a lot of the right elements, especially the action.  For some reason though, it never really clicked. The background music is bland, and most of the acting is lacking emotion - leaving the viewer very detached.  The chemistry between the actors also seemed forced, with the possible exception of the cop and the transporter. You can't really blame all of them; the Chinese father/daughter spoke broken English like you would expect from a Jet Li movie. The strong points were the action, but many of these scenes were overdrawn and too controlled (you'll know what I mean from the final battle in the container yard). The plot was very thin, but it took so long to materialize that you might not realize it.  Overall, the film left me depressed and expecting more. Decent attempt.  6/10",neutral,6,tt0293662

"If there was such thing as a sequal being better than the first one, than this is it! The Two Towers are full of everything a movie needs: action, romance,suspence, and even some comedy. Peter Jackson has totally brought Middle Earth to life as he introduces us to new characters, such as Eowyn, and re-aquaint ourselves with others, such as Gollum. We also go where no one has gone before, like Rohan, and deep into Mordor. You don't even have to read the book in order to understand what is going on. It would keep you on the edge of your seat. However, if you actually read the book, there were a couple of things that every movie based on books has. It doesn't have every detail that was described in the book. Although it has happened before, and most likely will happen again, you just can't get over it. However, we can only hope that whatever is missing in this movie will pop up in the next one.

"On January 22nd, 2013, Richard Roeper posted a ZERO STAR review of this movie, calling it ""The Citizen Kane of Awful."" That's quite a statement, and looking up clips on You Tube can confirm such a claim. I happend to find a unopened Blu-ray of it at Salvation Army yesterday, so I bought it and watched it before bed, out of curiosity. Movie 43 is a bizarre movie, that's for sure. It focuses on Dennis Quaid pitching a skit film to Hollywood, and he makes different producers hear the script. People sit in horror at his ideas, which include but are not limited to: *Chloe Grace Moretz getting a period on a date around some idiotic boys. *Kate Winslet on a blind-date with Hugh Jackman, who has his neck, unbeknownst to others. *Parents bullying their child that they home-school. *A staff meeting on the IBabe, an IPod that looks like a nude woman, which teen boys use for sex and get their privates mangled in. *A couple plan to defecate on each other for a date, but things don't go as planned. These are 5 examples of the 13 skits that this film contains. If you are already turned off by this movie, then you will most likely loathe it. But if you had a long day at work like I did, or you just need something silly, Movie 43 may be the movie you need. Look, Movie 43 is not great. It's no Blazing Saddles or Airplane! and it definitely should not be compared to Citizen Kane by any means. Some of the skits are gross(like the defection one), so I didn't love all the skits, but I got some ironic enjoyment out of watching it. If you hate it, I understand, and to an extent I actually agree. But with the right mindset, this is a movie you could laugh at with friends-at the quality, not so much the jokes. Like my title states,this movie is self-aware of how bad it is. When Dennis Quaid pitches some skits, people turn him down, wondering WHO WOULD SIT THROUGH THIS MOVIE HE WANTS TO MAKE? Get the joke? WE are watching his train-wreck of a movie. But no one wants to MAKE it! That's partly why this kind of worked for me. Sure there are 42 movies that are better than Movie 43. But compared to trash I've witnessed, like Night Patrol, I would prefer this. Hate on this critique all you want. I didn't care for the poop skit or the intercom one much, but I enjoyed the period and blind date skits. I'm sorry, have mercy on me. I'm sure there are times I would watch this and hate it, but I watched it with a proper mindset and enjoyed it. I thought this would be terrible. I changed my mind. You can take it or leave it. I've voiced my thoughts, now judge it for yourself.",neutral,5,tt1333125
"Fight Club is simply a fantastic film. It's a product of it's time that has simply aged like fine wine after nearly 23 years of it's inception, which still captures the angst and status frustration of young men as it did in the 1990's. No other film even comes as to close to Fight Club when it comes to capturing feelings of hopelessness and a lack of purpose, which is summed up perfectly in Tyler Durden's speech of ""Our Great War is a spiritual war, our great depression is our lives"". This film deserves a 10/10 as it creates a new perspective which properly challenges one's own take on life. It dares to question the role of men in our society, and how emasculated and docile we are, with no real drive or purpose, and instead indulge in pointless consumerism. It's so much more than an anti-capitalism film, it's a film that challenges the hollow, meaningless nature of society in general. An absolute must watch.",positive,10,tt0137523
"This film is the reason I was hesitant at all about seeing Magnolia.  From the gossip I heard of Magnolia, I thought they could have been describing this movie.  This is about the lives of LA kids that are confused in every possible way: about violence, sex, love...  There lives are going nowhere. I would have enjoyed the film on some level, only something happened.  Some apocalyptic force came and did something I won't disclose.  However, it didn't work or make sense.  It didn't fit with any theme, except for anarchic pessimism.  I like it when film-makers take chances that work, but this one falls flat on its face.  To anyone that didn't understand Magnolia, see this movie and then rewatch Magnolia.  I guarantee PTA's movie will make perfect sense.  Nowhere Rating: 3/10",negative,3,tt0119809
"The trick to these comic book superhero movies is not to take the source material too seriously. That's what made the original Batman from the 1980's, with Jack Nickolson as the Joker, work so well; everything about that movie, including all the main characters, was over the top, and rightfully so. We are, after all, talking about a man who goes out and fights crime while dressed up as a bat. How seriously, really, are we supposed to take such a notion? But this movie (among its various other flaws) takes itself WAY too seriously. It's supposed to be some deep, even epic, tale of, well, something. But, hey, if I want that, I could read Homer. Or Shakespeare. Or watch ""The Godfather"". Stories that truly are epic, in no small part because they feature real human characters, not ones that came out of a cartoon book. That said, I can only review so much of this movie because, quite honestly, I don't remember all that much from it. Nothing about it truly stood out in my mind, other than that the general theme seemed to be to inflict upon the audience several scenes of considerable cruelty and sadism. And, unlike in other movies where these qualities played a significant role (Silence of the Lambs, Apocalypse Now), here these elements seem to exist solely for shock value, not because they actually add anything to our deeper understanding of the story. Which brings us to the character of the Joker. Let me be blunt - Nickolson's Joker was at least ten times better than this one. Both are completely unbelievable, but Jack's Joker was at least interesting, even fun. He was a pleasure to watch in much the same way that a good James Bond villain is. But there is nothing pleasurable at all about Heath Ledger's Joker. First off, he is so psychotic that he couldn't function anywhere outside of an insane asylum; he kills off his own henchmen, burns their stolen money before their very eyes, yet this psycho somehow enlists a small army of loyal followers without giving them any reason to be loyal at all, and yet, despite being a complete walking mental meltdown, he manages to put in motion any number of very detailed terrorist plots that would require the exact opposite mindset, namely, one of cold and calculating rationality. In short, as a movie villain, he simply fails. Not only is he not credible at all, his sole contribution to the story is to add the aforementioned cruelty and sadism, making this not only a stupid and unbelievable movie, but a thoroughly depressing one as well. I mean, seriously. If you want to see movie characters who have a dark, twisted, and sadistic streak and yet come off as credible on the screen, one need look no further than such persons as Tommy from ""Goodfellas"" or Luca Brasi from ""The Godfather"". But the Joker from this film is just a void. Encountering his character was like stepping on a dog turd. The experience is wholly unpleasant and disgusting, but thankfully you forget about it pretty soon. 3/10",negative,3,tt0468569
"3 years after Batman begins people start talking about ""The Dark Knight"", and how good it was the film,i didn't understand the hype until i saw it one night on the TV, and it wasn't good, it was freaking awesome. For me, The Dark Knight its probably the best superhero movie to the date and i like to explain why: It was better than Batman Begins? Of course it was(at least for me), this movie repairs the aspects that Batman begins didn't do correctly(I still love Batman Begins) -The drama is spectacular. -its even darker than the first one. -The Car chase is awesome and its one of the best scenes of the movie. -The Action scenes are now great. Why its good by itself? -The casting again its great. -The soundtrack is as good as Batman begins. -The acting is fantastic. -The writing is good. -The Character Development is great, the movie makes every character interesting and important( more than Batman Begins) and it shows how important are their decisions and why the drama is spectacular. What about the villains? -The Joker, honestly for me and like everyone, was the best character and thing of the movie, its menacing, its scary, interesting and intimidating, again the acting is amazing.Heath Ledger did an amazing job. -I frankly didn't expect that Aaron Eckhart could play the role of Harvey Dent SO GOOD, he is just as scary and intimidating as the Joker(at least for me). My only concern is: -Harvey dent time screen( I would like to see more of this character in this film instead of a few scenes).But this is just a minor concern, at the end i think this movie works perfectly. For a 2.5 hour movie, i didn't get bored at any moment, not even when they show the replay again and again and again on TV, its still more interesting than other superhero movies, and one of my favorites. A highly recommended movie. 10/10",positive,10,tt0468569

"I've been told so many times to watch this movie. Finally, I've watched it and I just don't know where to begin. This movie is absolutely amazing in about every way. You never expect the ending or the plot twists as you keep trying to predict what is going to eventually happen. It takes you on such a good journey of the development of the MC and it gets more interesting as you go further. Sure, the beginning was slow and boring some people have said but it was worth the entire movie. The building point just leaves you blown away, in my experience. I love how everything has been left up to the viewer's interpretation, you connect the dots and you can create your own interpretations of the ending and overall the entire meaning of the message being portrayed. This movie was an eye opener and it has done its job beautifully. Feels like throughout this movie I started second guessing myself, I got pretty confused at some points, and then later the movie %100 satisfied the confusion I had. This movie deserves the hype that it has, it truly is an amazing watch. It was naturally funny, dramatic, motivating, eye opening and definitely gore filled. The cinematography was very well done, the actors gave a great performance, and the climax was great. Feels like I'll never see a movie that could be as great as this movie did with its plot. Fight Club makes you want to change your view or perspective on things and in life in general. It focused on corporate issues, materialism, the modern slavery of man kind today and much more. Fight Club makes you want to get up and fight just to feel excitement in any miserable experience you had or going through. I will definitely rewatch this movie and I feel like the second rewatch will be even better as I recognize all the hints and connect even more dots than the first watch. A genius made this concept and executed it perfectly, nothing can really change my mind about this movie. I loved it, 11/10 I recommend if you are not sensitive to the very graphic content of gore in this movie.",positive,11,tt0137523
"Good thriller - it is a good plot. In my opinion, the further the film, the more puzzles which keep us in the entire movie screen. And all of the solution - at the end, though all at once. The plot is the most important. That's why you must to see the movie. You never know what it will end. Second, this is the place. The island with all its old buildings is perfectly suited to the scenario. Weather, fortress, mysterious hundreds of rats, ominous cliff ferry with shackles and horror picture, lighthouse are created for the brilliant creations Scorsese. I was surprised by the memories of the main hero. Camp Dachau, wind, dead bodies, burning by hate DiCaprio or the burning house with his wife.

"Take a cheeky eight-year-old, put him in a situation he has to slapstick his way out of with the kind of antics most cartoon characters wouldn't survive, and what you have is one of the most wildly popular, commercially successful comedies of all time.  And when it's over, though most likely you'll have had a good time, you'll be tempted to ask the question:  Why? Because `Home Alone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written by John Hughes, is mediocre at best, though it does have it's moments.  It's a matter of the filmmakers being very astute, perhaps, and wisely mixing in a potpourri of elements with universal appeal and touching upon that common nerve they calculated would give just about anyone in the audience something to which they could relate.  And they were right.  Kids, Christmas, family, vacation, independence, a scary situation; it's all in here.  But, interestingly enough, it lacks the sentimental value that would seemingly have made this a movie one could truly embrace.  As it is, it's engaging fare, but somehow manages to keep the viewer at arm's length.  Then again, maybe that's even part of the appeal; it may be that audiences at this particular time and place were more comfortable just watching without having to invest anything of themselves in order to have a good time. This was, after all, 1990, and this film played to a generation weaned on more than a decade of Saturday Night Live, whose keen sense of biting satire and parody definitely had an influence on the mind-set of audiences everywhere.  And is that a bad thing?  No, absolutely not.  It merely points up one possible reason why a film centered around an eight-year-old with a somewhat derisive attitude could be so wholeheartedly received.  Also, it may be that the second half of the film, with it's over-the-top slapstick, is what made the final impression on the audience.  And this IS funny stuff; and it's going to get to even those who usually prefer humor that doesn't involve slapstick, because it's so well done.  Again, credit the filmmakers with having their fingers on the pulse of our culture and standards at the time.  But you also have to give credit to Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who bring the `Wet Bandits,' Harry and Marv,  to life, and know how to put across this kind of comedy, which is no easy task. The story itself is simple:  The extended McCallister family sets off for a Christmas vacation in Paris, and inadvertently, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) gets left behind.  Left alone.  At home.  Where, rising to the occasion beyond anything even the most prodigious teenager could manage, he discovers the thrill of being independent and thwarts a pair of bungling burglars in the balance.  Meanwhile, mom and dad (Catherine O'Hara as Kate, John Heard as Peter) go out of their minds when they get to Paris and discover what has happened.  If only they knew what an ingenious and imaginative son they had... Culkin is certainly a cute kid, but can he act?  Well, the jury is still out on that one.  It's hard to say, since the dialogue he is given is so ridiculously above that of an eight-year-old, and the situations he encounters are so far-fetched, that there is no real frame of reference by which to consider it objectively.  His timing and rhythm are lacking, however, that much is clear.  His responses-- or, if you will, the punch lines he delivers-- are always a beat behind what they should be.  And it robs the humor of the spontaneity that would have made it funnier, even hilarious.  As it is, the only real laughs come from Kevin's assault on the Wet Bandits, and there are plenty to be had there. Pesci and Stern become the real stars of the show as they play out their slapstick antics, which are truly deserving of the laughs they generate. Their expressions of incredulity in the face of the violence that is visited upon them is what makes this movie.  Everything else merely sets the stage for Harry and Marv's descent into the maelstrom.  And what Pesci and Stern do here should not be taken for granted, nor taken lightly artistically.  To put this kind of humor across takes some real talent on the part of consummate professionals, and Pesci and Stern certainly deliver it.  Their secret?  They play it straight, which keeps the silliness out of it.  Had they played it strictly as farce, it simply wouldn't have had the same impact; but by playing to the characters in the situation, rather than to a situation involving characters, it works.  And, once again, chalk up another one for Columbus and Hughes, who really know how to deliver this kind of material. The only truly poignant moment in the film involves Kevin's encounter with a mysterious neighbor, `Old Man Marley,' played wonderfully by character actor/poet Roberts Blossom.  The revelation of his secret earlier in the film sets up the purest moment of the ending, and though it is brief, it's inspired and adds a much needed perspective to the story. The supporting cast includes Devin Ratray (Buzz), Angela Goethals (Linnie), Gerry Bamman (Uncle Frank), Hillary Wolf (Aunt Leslie), Ralph Foody (Gangster Johnny), Billie Bird (Irene), Bill Erwin (Ed) and John Candy, memorable in the role of Gus Polinski, the Polka Band shuttle Chief. Considering the ratio between this movie's substance and the success it still enjoys today, `Home Alone' is something of an anomaly in the history of the genre.  it lacks insight, yet delivers some real belly laughs.  It lacks a single character the audience can truly embrace, yet is accepted overwhelmingly as is.  It lacks inspiration, yet is an inspired film in the way it is crafted and delivered.  It's one you're probably going to like and enjoy, but upon reflection may wonder, `Why.'  And the answer?  Who can say. Go figure.  It's the magic of the movies.  6/10.",neutral,6,tt0099785

"It is rare that a film so brilliant in every possible aspect comes your way, and even rarer that such a film will receive all the recognition it deserves. Some of the most brilliant pieces of cinema ever made (eg. Mulholland Drive, eXistenZ, Exotica) will be critically acclaimed, but largely ignored, while other films will be hyped to a ludicrous extent, but pale in comparison to some less widely-seen films. There are, however, exceptions. ""Fight Club"" is one such exception. Impossible to fault, David Fincher's apocalyptic satire and social dissection is a masterwork that proved, much to my surprise, to be every bit as brilliant as critics and viewers alike claimed it to be. Edward Norton's acting performance is one feature well and truly worthy of a mention, with his stunning job of the nameless narrator being everything that earlier performances such as ""Primal Fear"" promised. Yet it would be wrong to single Norton out without recognising the sheer brilliance of the entire supporting cast - Brad Pitt proves the immense extent to which he is wasted in most films, Helena Bonham-Carter is faultless, Meat Loaf Aday astonishes, as does Jared Leto. So many mindblowing performances are almost never seen together in the one film - Fincher could not have done a better job of bringing out the acting potential in each and every member of his cast. A fertile and brutally perceptive script goes perfectly alongside Fincher's stunning cinematography, present yet wasted in the apparently disappointing ""Panic Room"" (I have not yet seen it myself). Even the grotesque violence can be forgiven in such a film as this, when acting, direction and scripting are all perfect. I doubt that Hollywood will so brilliantly hit the spot again in the near future - ""Fight Club"" was a work of rare genius and will, I believe, remain extremely high on my list of films for some time yet. 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523

"The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!! The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad. Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures) The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito. Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter.

"This film is long and dull. As a result of the first it is dull for very long periods, which is why this film warrants no more than a miserly 1/10. The acting is competent but no more and I must confess I lost my focus towards the end due to the quite shocking lack of entertainment that can be attributed to a poor script, lacklustre direction and a plot which leaves a lot to be desired. People say Godfather is rare in that its sequel improves upon it, but that isn't hard. Al Pacino gained a big reputation from this one and I am left bemused as to why, and this unfortunate idea has meant Pacino, a mediocre actor at best has been able to infiltrate our cinema screens on far too many occasions with a distinct lack of passion or charisma in any role he displays.",negative,1,tt0068646
"SOME SPOILERS CONTAINED! The fast and the furious.... If this title is told many people think about the coolest film on earth, the greatest cars and the greatest drivers. I don't know yet why though. I am personally into cars. I'm also interested in mechanics and electronics in general and I do know about that topic so don't tell me I have no clue what I'm going to talk about. The film is made for 6-year-olds. There are ""cool"" (in my point of view pretty stupid) paint jobs, roaring engines and of course NO2! And then there is Vin Diesel who plays cocky Torreto. So they race illegally and the young cop is sent out to investigate the racing. The racing is nothing spectacular. 400 meters straight line, the best built car wins or whose engine can manage the most turbo pressure or nitrous in other words. In total there are only few races throughout the whole film and it's rather boring to watch them. The cars the characters are racing could not be as powerful as real drag racing cars so the handling should be relatively easy as well. That fact already doesn't make the racers heroes in front of my eyes. But racing is acceptable. The worst part of the movie is Torreto's gang truck robbing. It is so unrealistic and stupid that I don't have words for it. Every thinking person can understand how lame it looks. You can't hold on the truck with nothing to worry about when a truck is traveling about 100 km/h. And just how it looks. Truck drivers don't really do anything to get rid of them except the last one who starts shooting the gang. And finally the whole story limps. It's very stereotypical and overall boring. I'm not gonna spoil too much but basically the undercover working cop merges into Torreto's gang and eventually starts defending Torreto. In the end he still founds out that Torreto is involved to truck robbing and tries to put the end to that. He also flirts with Torreto's sister. Some gang members speculate he's a cop but Torreto doesn't take that seriously etc. In other words quite boring story. All in all I'd say that Fast and furious is a weak movie, unrealistic and quite boring. I don't know how this movie is so highly respected because for me it really doesn't look anything special. 2/10",negative,2,tt0232500

"This movie was a disappointment for me, I am a huge Tolkien fan and I loved the Fellowship movie, but Two Towers has some big flaws that prevented it from being as good as the first in the trilogy... 1. Very americanized, they put alot of cheesy hollywood gimmicks into it, they also obviously added more of Viggo and Orlando, because of the sucess of the previous film.  I found these thing disturbing, and it shamed Tolkien's perfect tale. 2. Bad editing/pacing.  They felt they had to juggle all of the characters more and more throughout the movie, it is very distracting because in the book, Tolkien perfectly went from one group to the next, right when you're getting really excited, so it kept the interest of the reader high.  This was not done in the movie however. 3. MORE changes in the story.  The film's biggest flaw, they changed more of the story, added some lousy scenes into the movie that weren't in the book, and had some bad add-ons also.  This disappointed me because they were pretty good about keeping the movie close to the book in the first movie, what I felt this movie was is a gift to the stupid audiences to make more money. I just wanted to stress these major flaws because all the reviews I have seen say this movie was great, even better than the Fellowship. But there are a couple good features in this film, like Gollum is spectacular, I have to take my hat off for the special effects people, because that character was extremely well done. And I was impresses with Elijah Wood's acting in this movie, he was outshined in the first one, but he really showed his talent in a couple scenes in this one. Overall, I would say this movie was 7.5/10, but perhaps people would like it if they haven't read the books, and had nothing to compare it to.",neutral,5,tt0167261
"Fight Club isn't just a movie-it's a visceral, mind-bending experience that punches you in the gut and leaves you questioning everything. David Fincher's 1999 cult classic is a flawless fusion of anarchic energy, razor-sharp satire, and psychological depth, cementing its place as one of the greatest films ever made. A Revolution in Storytelling
From the very first frame, *Fight Club* grabs you by the throat and never lets go. The unreliable narration, the subliminal flashes, the relentless pacing-every detail is meticulously crafted to immerse you in the fractured psyche of the nameless Narrator (Edward Norton). The plot unfolds like a fever dream, blurring the lines between reality and delusion until the earth-shattering twist recontextualizes everything. Brad Pitt & Edward Norton: Perfection Personified
Norton delivers a career-best performance as the disillusioned everyman, his descent into madness both terrifying and mesmerizing. But it's Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden who steals the show. Their chemistry is electric, a twisted yin-and-yang that drives the film's dark heart. Helena Bonham Carter's Marla Singer is the perfect chaotic counterpart, raw and unapologetically broken. A Scathing Critique of Modern Manhood & Consumerism
Fight Club is more than just brutal brawls and soap-making-it's a ferocious indictment of capitalist emptiness and emasculated modern life. Tyler Durden's rants (""The things you own end up owning you"") hit harder with each passing year, as society spirals further into mindless consumption. The film's themes of rebellion, identity, and self-destruction are timeless, resonating with anyone who's ever felt trapped by the system. Fincher's Direction & The Dust Brothers' Score
Fincher's signature cold, hyper-stylized visuals make every scene pulse with tension. The fight scenes are raw and visceral, the editing is frenetic yet precise, and the cinematography (by Jeff Cronenweth) bathes the grunge in an almost surreal glow. The Dust Brothers' industrial, pulsating score is iconic, amplifying the film's anarchic energy. The Twist That Changes Everything
Even over two decades later, that reveal remains one of cinema's most jaw-dropping moments. The first viewing is a revelation, the second a completely different experience-every line, every glance, every frame takes on new meaning. It's storytelling at its most audacious and brilliant. A Legacy That Never Dies
Fight Club was misunderstood upon release, dismissed by some as glorified violence. But time has proven it a prophetic, endlessly quotable masterpiece. Its influence echoes in everything from modern antihero narratives to meme culture (""You do not talk about Fight Club""). It's a film that demands discussion, debate, and repeat viewings. Final Verdict: Flawless. Revolutionary. Unforgettable. Fight Club is more than a movie-it's a manifesto, a wake-up call, and a work of art that refuses to be ignored. Every performance, every line, every frame is perfect.10/10-a flawless, era-defining masterpiece that still hits like a sledgehammer to the soul. ""You are not your job. You are not how much money you have in the bank. You are not the contents of your wallet.""

"The only thing I liked in this movie is John Cho. He is so likeable and watchable. Everytime he shows up on screen, things get better and you immediately connect with him and whatever he's trying to do. Other than that, this is a dull and unpleasent film. This franchise is known for in each movie having three different narratives all centered on the same house and at the end, all stories start to intervene together. That's what this movie does. When a movie does that right, we get a big twist reveal and payoff. But that's not the case in this movie. In the very beggining, we're told information about a couple of the different storylines and through the rest of the movie, it shows us how they play out. There's not a big twist reveal. It just shows us something that it has already told us. Because of that the movie has no tension. We just see the outcomes we already knew were going to happen. Maybe that would've worked if the movie gave the characters compelling arcs. But instead, the movie gives the characters really depressing backstories, haunts them with ghosts and then brutally murders them. Now I understand that this is a horror movie. Obviously it's going to be very dark and it's going to have a lot of murder and death inside of it. But there's no character arcs here. There's not really any story here either. Stories have tension, back and forths, colflicts that have to be overcome and victories. Here everything starts bad and it gets worse as you go along in very unpleasent ways that are not remotely enjoyable at all. I could forgive all of this if this worked as scary movie. But the movie doesn't work as a scary movie. The scares are just people walking down hallways, turning around and a face pops out on the screen. That's what this movie does. It's just a lot of jumpscares. It doesn't do anything new with the genre. It doesn't do anything new with the franchise. Even the kills themselves, half the time, it cuts away right as the kills are about to happen and when you do see the kills, it's just generic people getting scared and chrasing into something or they just jump of a building. Very simplistic, not interesting. So you have a movie where you don't care about the characters, the stories they do tell are really unpleasent, there's no tension and payoff, the scares don't work and the deaths aren't cool. Put all that together and you have a dreadful movie with a very nice performance from John Cho. 3.3/10 you're not missing much and you can absolutely skip this one.",negative,3,tt3612126
"INTERSTELLAR : i love Nolan but here is my opinion : the most positive thing is that IT makes you Think and Talk about it... but its far from being a masterpiece and yet so close... The black hole and the few glimpse of it are amazing and the movie is overall an interesting exercise of thoughts ( lot of room for interpretations ""wink"" ;) O.o ) ... it also has a fairly entertaining subplot led by m'a boY ""with many identities"" which gave a little more life to the show ---- but honestly it lacks on the visual experience ... not the quality of it , but it doesn't give you much to play with - very few is seen, in fact most of it is a cockpit or a corn field house... most of all some parts are TOO LONG on needless dialogues/self serving explanations ( going in a circles with some subjects...) which drags a good part of the movie to a point where even A. Hathaway couldn't finish her overly corny monologue without failing... this monologue could have been excellent , if it was maybe 2minutes shorter...the plot overall is fairly predictable since it plays with the same old school sci fi theme ( note that it leaves room to interpretation but still *** ) ... and also M.Mco is like mumbling the whole movie , which doesn't help with dominant ""bass""on the soundtrack ... lastly, yes it tries to reach the emotional side ( a subject i like : families) but it does not quite achieve it , mostly because of inconsistency in the writing which makes for some epic moments but also in many instances for some awkward/irrelevant/forced moments--- Anyway : still Worth a Watch and a Good movie.. i think most of the pb lies in the fact that it tries too hard and yet fall short doing so... i don't think this show is for everyone but i would give it a 7.5/10 ( please understand that even if i'm being critical .. this is objectively ... it doesn't mean that subjectively i didn't enjoy the show .... also : give me one of those robots :) ) --",neutral,5,tt0816692

"My quick rating - 4,1/10. Don't listen to any nonsense about how violent/gore filled this is. It just isn't. The movie leads itself to being a sequel within a new movie premise taken a step further from how part 2 was to 1. Kudos to Tom Six for making sequels that don't follow the traditional role, but smack him at the same time for being so pretentious to think a film fan won't see right through his arrogance. Multiple scenes of what Tom considers humor point this out entirely by being long, drawn out scenes with Deiter Laser (Bill Boss) acting like a complete jackass overacting a joke to the point that would make Jim Carrey cringe. Basically the story in a nutshell (about all you need) is a deranged prison warden (Laser) decides at his last straw to use the ideas from the Human Centipede movies to punish criminals and deter further offenders to ever break the law. This revelation is made when the governor (played by, wait for it, Eric Roberts) gives Boss 2 weeks to get his prison in order. What better way then take all the prisoners and sew them ass to mouth together, right? Anyway, back to the gore, a scene or two MAY have been considered ""gross"" years ago, but there is nothing to raw at all. Some of the humor is quite funny in a very dark way (his idea of health food is one of them) but the overshadowing of the poor acting is a deterrent (in other words, yes, it is a b- budget movie BUT it was so painfully obvious the actors were purposely acting bad to become a b-budget movie) So again the numbnut,Tom Six, thinks he is outsmarting the audience with this backasswards attempt at laughs. These laughs tend to come more from suggestion and the cheesy attempt at being an exploitative film(women should love a secretary named ""Tits"") All and all, it has the pros but is to outweighed by the cons. Good news, it was only supposed to be a trilogy, so we may be spared of another one.",negative,1,tt1883367
"""We begin by coveting what we see every day."" This is a film which I've seen quite a few times before, the most recent one being several months ago with a good friend of mine. It was one of the first movies that truly blew me away in the beginning of my dive into cinema (quite some time before I started reviewing stuff here). I used to bring it up anytime I was talking about my favorite films, and I was curious how this film will feel now, after some research and in a less casual watching. The Silence of the Lambs, based on the book by the same name, is a 1991 psychological thriller, directed by Jonathan Demme (the guy that made Stop Making Sense, which I'm yet to see but just a little fun fact I wanted to throw in there). The film follows Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), a young FBI trainee who aims to work in the Behavioral Sciences Unit of the organization, and gets assigned an unusual task: she's told to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), an imprisoned psychiatrist murderer with a bad cannibalistic habit. As their conversations go on, a connection is drawn between Clarice's task and the efforts to catch Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who's been highly active as of late. Will she be able to endure Hannibal's cruel mind games in order to catch a murderer on the loose? First of all, I think that the cast deserves some kudos - almost everyone is giving very solid performances, but I'd like to focus on the two main actors, the way I see it: Foster and Hopkins. Foster has a pretty subtle performance here, sliding naturally into Clarice. You can see the nuance that makes it clear that she tries to brush thing off or put up a tough front even when she's in a harsh situation, and that makes it all the more powerful when Clarice does show signs of anxiety, stress or horror. I want to hold my thoughts on Hopkins for a moment and take a look at another aspect of Clarice, and this movie in general. One thing that has a lot of presence in this movie is the idea of ""the male gaze"", the way that beautiful women get stripped down and objectified by men's lustful stares. Clarice, as an FBI trainee, is often threading in very male-dominant territories, and there are a lot of instances in which she's in this power struggle, trying to gain respect from machoistic figures that can't seem to wrap their head around the idea of seeing her as equal. These moments create a very interesting and constant tension in the film, and the cinematography enhances this feeling as well, putting us in Clarice's shoes more often than not. Hopkins as Hannibal is great, too, almost like he was born to play this role. He has this cruel, cold charm about him, while he always keeps so calm and composed, even when he does some pretty horrible stuff. This guy is the most dangerous person in the room even behind bars, and it definitely speaks to his power as a villain of sorts in this movie. The conversations between Clarice and him are always full of mind games, and most of the time it's like Hannibal is only playing with Clarice, his prey. A totally well-deserved Oscar, in my opinion. I won't spoil anything, but my favorite sequences in the film involve Lecter and they're really, really amazing. Especially the one that starts with classical music in the background and ends with a twist. If you know you know. Also, something about the way that Hannibal toys with Clarice and the way that Jodie Foster portrays this tough front of her cracking up when she needs to either dive into her traumas or let someone else lose their life makes her really relatable. She comes across as a real person, and again, kudos to Foster on that. The pacing is really solid, and I like the way that some scenes are edited in a way that they seem to really flow into each other. I do enjoy the second half of the movie more, but it's only understandable, since the first half has more buildup in it, and the second half has so many climaxes. I don't feel like I have any major negative thing to say about this film. The only thing that slightly bothered me was the feeling that some psychological aspects were a little oversimplified, but it's nothing serious and I still think that the movie is doing a really good job when it comes to building characters that feel full and solid. The Silence of the Lambs doesn't impress me as much as it did when I first watched it, but I still had a really good time with it. It's tense, the main cast is great, and there are some mind games that are truly immersive in my opinion, especially as the plot moves on and it gets more bloody and intense. Feeling an 8.3/10 on this one. P. S

"How does one grade ""Plan 9 From Outer Space?""  If we say that director/writer/producer/editor Ed Wood Jr. was trying to film a serious, scary movie, well then ""Plan 9"" is a terrible, terrible movie.  Dreadful. Incompetent.  Poorly acted and directed. Yet, I invite anyone to try to watch this movie without smiling.  It falls into the category of movies that are so-bad-they're-good.  And while I wouldn't go so far as to call ""Plan 9"" a good movie, it is a funny one. How can you not laugh when Tor Johnson stumbles as he is getting out of his grave?  Or when Criswell warns us all that the future will affect us all...in the future.  Or (my personal favorite) the incredible lack of attention paid to continuity between day and night scenes.  Cars drive up to a site during the day, the car stops and everyone gets out, and it's night! I gave ""Plan 9"" a 4/10, on the basis of its original goals and its lack of succeeding in them.  This is not a horror film; the only thing that scared me in this movie was the Vampira's garishly skinny waist.  But as an unintentional comedy, the film is almost a 10.  The only movie I know that is funnier without intending to be so is ""Batman and Robin.""  Perhaps that was Joel Schumacher's homage to Ed Wood.",negative,4,tt0052077

"What can I say? As much as I would like to enjoy these LOTR movies, I just can't seem to get into the spirit of this series. I found the first one beautiful to look at, but ultimately dull and not involving. Even gave it a second chance by watching it on DVD. Nothing. Glowing reviews and the promise of a ""better film"" got me into the theater for this one. Well, Gollum ""is"" a technical wonder. This CGI marvel is by far, the most engaging character in the movie. The battle near the end of the movie is also wonderful to look at. Lots of good ""eye candy"" there. But the rest of the movie? (Yawn!) Why would director Peter Jackson, spend over two hours building to the climax of this movie, the battle, and then keep cutting away from it to show us the two Hobbits and Treebeard walking & talking? For me, it kept grinding the film to a halt. And extended DVD's? Are you kidding me? These movies are plenty long enough as is, thank you very much. One thing's for sure, I don't care how good the reviews are for the next chapter. I won't be rushing off to see Return of the King. 6/10",neutral,6,tt0167261
"Before I explain why I don't think this is worthy of much of the praise it's been given here, I'll point out that I haven't read any of the Lord Of The Rings books, so that may affect my judgement. The main reason I didn't like the film much was that I don't think many of the characters were very well developed. Once the fellowship was formed, it seemed that I was supposed to sympathise with the members, when there was barely any information given about them. From then the film became repetitive, moving from one fight sequence to the next, with emotional interludes that didn't involve me much. I lost most sense of excitement at the battles because in many cases we didn't know anything about the adversary - the name of something was mentioned and a fight began with little explanation. There were good points to the film - generally good acting, great scenery and special effects. Many films would get away with a procession of action set-pieces, but I don't think this does, because most of the fights are not well filmed. There are fast cuts and camera movements, presumably intended to make it feel more exciting, but I felt they simply confused and reduced the freedom to watch what was actually meant to be going on. My enjoyment of this film may have been affected by the huge hype. If I hadn't been expecting so much, I might've liked it simply as a fun sequence of battles and scenery. As it is I can say it was not bad, but I certainly don't reccomend it highly. The final thing that disappointed me was the ending. I know it's leaving it open for a sequel, but I still think the ending was disappointing. For a film with a sequel already planned, there should at least be something which appears to be an ending, or there should be a cliffhanger. Fellowship Of The Ring just seemed to stop in a random place. 5/10",neutral,5,tt0120737
"1. I gave this movie 6/10 when I first watched it two years ago. What the hell was wrong with me? 2. I didn't want DiCaprio to win the Oscar in 2013 because I thought McConaughey was more deserving (and Ejiofor was more than both). But now that the Internet got him an Oscar for The Revenant, I think its a huge shame because this is where DiCaprio's strengths lie. Jordan Belfort is a loud, bombastic, debauched, deranged, hyperactive animal - and we love him every moment he's on screen. DiCaprio invests him with an animalistic energy that dips into humanity's id and just lets himself go crazy. 3. Without DiCaprio's performance, this three hour movie would feel its length. That's why The Revenant killed me - it was just painful waiting for something to happen. Here, there is ALWAYS something happening. 4. Props to Jonah Hill for his fantastic performance as well - likely the finest of his career. His big, gleaming fake smile and his equally depraved behaviour is a perfect compliment to DiCaprio. The best scenes in the film involve Jonah Hill, who gets an even stronger reaction out of you with his frustrating behaviour. But in the film's more serious moments, there is that Goodfellas camaraderie between Azoff and Belfort that makes the characters feel like real adults who lived. 5. The rest of the cast is also up for the challenge, with talented TV actors like Kenneth Choi, Jon Bernthal and Ethan Suplee appearing memorably amongst Belfort's chums, Oscar winners Matthew McConaughey and Jean Dujardin stealing the show in small roles, and directors like Jon Favreau, Spike Jonze and Rob Reiner stopping by an being generally excellent (Reiner is particularly memorable as ""Mad Max"" Belfort). McConaughey's scenes are hypnotic in their excellence. But the real standout is Margot Robbie, who I watched when she was on Neighbours and love seeing her breakout into the main stream. 6. Robbie is completely intoxicating, thanks in part to the film's makeup and costume team. The comparison with Cristin Milioti as Jordan's first wife is a subtle but clever one - despite Milioti being cute as a button, the film makes her look just a little bit too frumpy or standard compared to the luxurious Naomi. 7. A lot of the film was improvised, which pads the run time a bit but the fun that everyone is having is incredibly infectious. The things that are unforeseen, like a kitchen island during the Quayludes scene, contribute even more to the film. The continuous and excessive swearing is magnificent. 8. Scorsese and his cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto dart around the film with freeze frames, slow-motion, tracking shots and multiple lenses to show up the drug high scenes. It is really impressive filmmaking. 9. The use of music is great as well, especially with the McConaughey humming replicated into a musical score to play over key moments. 10. This is Scorsese's best movie since Casino, possibly even better. It is full of manic energy, the mood of each scene is unbelievable. DiCaprio is an actor to be treasured, and I hope Scorsese has one or two more of these still in him.",neutral,6,tt0993846

"I look at many of the contenders that would be the most marvellous movies ever made and can only be more reassured of this film's true status as the absolute pinnacle of what Hollywood has tried to portray over the past century. This film (as many greats), was originally ignored by critics even shunned. So we should ask what actually makes a good film..., what makes the perfect movie???? Well, the answer in three words is .... 'The Shawshank Redemption'. This film was originally put down because it was not the best filmed or best acted etc., but overall it is better than 'ANYTHING' ever before and the benchmark for all that followed. I can't imagine a movie lover who would dismiss any notion that his or her life was made slightly better by this film (YES REALLY IT IS THAT GOOD). The Godfather films even The lord of the rings are enormous cinematic triumphs, but for me the measure of a film is in how it tells a story, and how it leaves you feeling at the end. I can't imagine any narcotic that could rouse you in the same way as this would should you be viewing for the first time. A simple story of a middle class young man, imprisoned for killing his wife in an unforgiving fortress, left with nothing but his intelligence and his strength of heart. Through his relationships with his inmates, and his ability to survive we walk every step with Andy until we finally witness the genius of .....

"This movie was creepy and not as bad as some I have seen, but still it was far from what I call a ""good"" horror movie. It was basically just about a boy who sees dead people, and the twist at the end was rather confusing. The actors are all a bit depressing, and maybe the movie is supposed to be like that or something, but M. Night Shyamalan has made much better movies than this, and I think the ghost scenes were all a little too exaggerated. This movie would have worked a lot better if it was a psychological thriller, not with supernatural events, like it could have turned out that Cole's condition might have had something to do with his mind, like he thinks that he is seeing dead people, or something like that, something similar to what Gothika is based on. This movie is OK to watch, and can get a little scary in places, but I still think it could have been a lot better without all these supernatural events actually being for real, it would have helped me to enjoy it a lot more, and the ending could have been a much better one, for example Malcolm helps Cole but realises that he's not actually dead and then gets reconciled with his wife or something. (I know this sounds confusing, but bear with me because I'm not a very good critic!). Anyway,I would like it if he talked with his wife at the end and then got reconciled with her, and it ended out that he's not dead. I would have liked that much better.

"Right after watching LOTR, the group I was with - all of whom having read the trilogy several times - started debating whether this one was truer or less true to the original than Fellowship was. Even moreso than with FOTR, we concluded quite quickly that we didn't *care* about these deviations. The score was much more balanced than FOTR. I have read many times that Howard Shore has composed the score for the entire trilogy as one piece of music, however the Wagnerian usage of themes was a lot less obvious in this installment than it was in Fellowship. Furthermore, where in FOTR Gimli was a little too recognizable as a standard John Rhys-Davies character, in TTT he appears more ""natural"" in his fumbling, quirky behavior, probably because he knows when to keep his mouth shut. In short, I found his character to be a nuisance in FOTR, and a great source of comic relief in TTT. As for the Elves, their stance towards humans seemed to have grown more distant and in the case of ""Agent Smith"" Elrond (I can't help it) sometimes almost seems hostile. Which of course breeds tension for the love triangle that develops between Arwen, Eowyn and Aragorn - something I anticipate will deepen in part three even though Tolkien's original barely scratches the surface. Smeagol, in his computer generated glory, is a visual delight if one can call a wretch like him that. His creepy, crawly hideousness goes beyond the human form, so Jackson made an excellent choice in putting the latest and the greatest of rendering systems to work, and the end result is simply baffling. Especially since the immense pity Frodo feels for the creature takes hold of the viewer as well. Not bad for a bunch of pixels. Also wonderfully done are the Ents, whose way of disposing with Orcs I couldn't help but find terribly amusing. Here you see the splatter artist Jackson briefly appear, though the film keeps neatly within its PG-13 borders. There are some weaknesses in the editing storyline, and I am left wondering why this had to be done. Probably the alterations made for the Battle of Helm's Deep allow for a grander army to come from Isengard without the story losing too much of its credibility, but one wonders whether this could not also have been accomplished by simply doubling the garrison. Nevertheless, special praise has to be given for the way vast armies are created with the help of computers, ironically the very machines Tolkien was anxious about. I will not go into much detail, but you can very well expect to be swept off your feet by the intensity, the grimness and the sheer magnitude of it all. There has never been a battle on a movie screen with such ferocity and enormity, and one can only speculate what will happen once New Line unleashes the third installment of this already epic trilogy.

"Scorsese and DiCaprio is almost impossible to fail, but here it's at it's absolute best! DiCaprio is spectacular and i genuinely wonder HOW he didn't win an oscar for this.

Especially the scene where he lost his senses and had to stop his friend from talking to the phone was so amazing i almost choked laughing! Jordan's descend into madness, greed and addiction is shown in a hilarious way, without however overromantisising his hideous lifestyle as many claim, since his actions have direct consequences, and ultimately lead to his downfall. The only reason i don't give this movie a 10 is because i believe it drags on for a bit too long, and at one point it might be a bit too excessive.

"I saw this movie for the first time when it came on television earlier this month. After seeing it at #1 on the IMDb Top 250, I thought this would be a good opportunity to check it out. The story was gripping and I especially liked the pacing, with the story moving along at a quick pace, covering years in a matter of minutes. The film was quite gritty and realistic throughout but started losing that quality as it started feeling more like a fairy tale towards the end. Although the story was initially focused on Andy, it later became quite apparent that Red was the true protagonist, who Morgan Freeman portrayed in one of his best performances to date. I believe Morgan Freeman deserved an Oscar for his performance, although he lost it to Tom Hanks, who gave an equally great performance in Forrest Gump that same year. Although I disagree with The Shawshank Redemption's ranking at #1 on the IMDb Top 250, I believe it is worthy enough to at least be among the top 100 films.

"FILM: 8.5/10. Eight years after the Batman franchise was driven into the ground by Joel Schumacher at the direction of Warner Bros and their need for a merchandising and kid-friendly film, an unlikely person steps up to the plate: Christopher Nolan. I really enjoyed his earlier works, so when I heard he was taking the reigns of a character I love, I was intrigued. Nolan delivers a largely realistic take on the Dark Knight, focusing more on the psychology of Batman, and it's great. The gritty atmosphere of Gotham City is palpable, and the exploration of Bruce Wayne's inner demons adds depth to the character. Christian Bale was an interesting choice following his turn as Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, and he is imposing in the role. He captures both the darkness and the vulnerability of Batman, making him a truly believable hero. Nolan's decision to cast quite a few heavyweights around him in the form of Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman means there's a depth of quality too. Caine brings warmth and wisdom as Alfred, Freeman is the perfect fit as the brilliant Lucius Fox, and Oldman shines as the determined and incorruptible Commissioner Gordon. The chemistry among the cast members elevates the film and adds another layer of enjoyment. We still get the gadgets and there's more than enough action to satisfy any fan of the Caped Crusader. However, it's interesting to note that the action becomes more generic once the technological MacGuffin is introduced. The film shines brightest in its exploration of Batman's origins and his transformation into the symbol of justice Gotham needs. Batman Begins is an impressive injection of life into a franchise killed by Bat-nipples, neon, and terrible jokes. Nolan's direction and the darker tone bring a refreshing and mature approach to the character. The film successfully sets the stage for a new era of Batman on the big screen, leaving me eager for more. It also had a tantalizing stinger at the end that hints at exciting possibilities for future installments. Batman Begins is a must-watch for any Batman fan. Nolan's vision and the exceptional performances by the cast make it a standout entry in the superhero genre. It revitalizes the character and sets the foundation for the remarkable trilogy to follow.

"Inception is a highly overrated film. But it's still solid, and I would recommend it potentially based on the viewer. There are many reasons to dislike Inception, a lack of emotional depth, huge pacing issues, predictability and an overemphasis on the concept of shared dreams rather than the plot. Let us be honest, the characters are rather dull. And the film is so overly complex it thinks it's the next Matrix, it's not, it's no where near as good. Visually, Inception is stunning, and Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as always but this does not excuse the poor plot, the music is good however. 6/10: Confusing, forgettable, but has moments of brilliance. Most likely if someone says it's a 10/10 they're likely just following the crowd.",neutral,6,tt1375666
"The Dark Knight is a great movie. Unfortunately, little niggly things keep it from being truly great. Editing choices, pacing of certain scenes, omitted scenes where we are left to assume something has happened, all keep it from being the organic experience Batman Begins was. The story is also a lot denser and cluttered, which isn't a bad thing in itself of course. But I felt that the time taken just to remember who was who (and what they looked like when we briefly saw them 30 minutes earlier in the film) kept getting in the way of me just absorbing the movie. The one thing that I felt was truly brilliant about Batman Begins was that it was a movie you could ""feel"", the story didn't get in the way of the atmosphere the filmmakers were trying to create. It felt like they had stripped the dialog down to the bare minimum, and they left the rest of the storytelling to the music and visuals. I thought it felt much more focused and engaging. This focus on atmosphere, and delivering the emotional heart of the film through music, also allowed them to take some, when viewed out of context, fairly cheesy or out-of-place lines of dialog, and somehow make them very powerful and moving, even memorable. If they release a Director's Cut of The Dark Knight, where they have my permission to gladly add 20 minutes of material removed during editing (gore and violence scenes, possibly small omitted scenes needed to make the story flow better and to make the narrative a bit more clear and engaging rather than feeling like you are just crudely hopping between scenes at times), then The Dark Knight could be as awesome as it might be able to be. A good example of the problems the movie suffers from can be found when you examine the use of the musical score in the film. In Batman Begins there were many long scenes where the music was allowed to really take its time, to build emotionally over several minutes and really carry the film from an emotional viewpoint. In The Dark Knight, there are almost no such moments. Sometiems there is a touching 20 second scene crammed between 2 violent or chaotic scenes, and the music tries desperately to infuse some emotional support for that scene, which is almost pointless when it happens. 20 seconds isn't nearly enough to take a viewer from excited to feeling sadness or love. Instead it almost feels kind of insulting when you realize what just happened, and it takes you out of the movie a bit as well. Overall I feel it is a great movie with great acting, great action and a rich and engaging story which is more eventful and dense than the first film. The fact that I felt the movie (already well over 2 hours long) could have benefited from another 20 minutes of material, to sort out some moments of unclarity and just make the story more engaging and connected, speaks volumes about the quality of the quality work represented on screen. But certain issues, with unnatural scene progressions, too tight editing that doesn't allow the emotional message in a scene to fully sink in, editing that skips between events too much rather than taking one thing at a time, and omitted scenes or events, together with a story that I feel could really benefit from extended scenes and more room to breathe at times, keeps it from being as emotionally engaging and essential as Batman Begins was. I give it 8/10, but the more time passes since I saw it, the more it's leaning towards a solid 7/10.",positive,8,tt0468569
"Overhyped, overlong. This montage of bloody spit and broken bones gives new meaning to the word excess. For the 2 hours and 45 minutes, you finally realize that violence doesn't solve anything especially in a story that begins to tailspin to celluloid death (which was the downfall of The Game) after the most intense scene in the film(the chem-burn).  The twist here is nothing compared to the Sixth Sense.  It's a cop-out, in fact, so that it could end.  It's disgusting to see masses of Americans gobble up anything Fincher offers.  Overall, this film is pure audience manipulation. Its subtext is like Three Kings (not subtle but blatant, overemphasized, and numbing).  One wishes that there is anything to see in a second viewing. To me, this isn't filmmaking for the sake of art or entertainment.  It's filmmaking leaning towards the lines of propaganda. Has Fincher desensitized you all?  And if Fight Clubs exist or are starting, are you going to blame the movie for starting them???  5/10.  Don't bring the kids.",neutral,5,tt0137523

"This movie was everything a good movie should be. I got The Godfather box set last Christmas (I had already watched the series about 20 times by then) and I watched it honestly about 3 weeks straight after getting it. This movie however is hands-down my favorite of the series. The story was amazing, and sure made Mafia life look like paradise. I loved the characters, all of them, even the antagonists were unforgettable. Everything looked authentic 1940's style, there weren't any slip-ups as far as I can tell. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale all make a very authentic looking, and truly remarkable family. I was a huge Godfather encyclopedia for a while, I knew 95% of the characters and everything, and its easy to see why, this is a very memorable movie in every aspect. I loved this film at first sight. I read some of the ""Hated it"" comments, and they all say its boring or something. Those people need to grow up, if you want an action movie watch Die Hard or something, this movie is a classic and if those people lack the taste for good movies to watch it they need to take their hate of it elsewhere. This is a perfect movie and deserves a 10/10. Watch this if you want a truly unforgettable experience.",positive,10,tt0068646
"First time i saw this movie was my film appreciation class in my freshman year of high school. Let that sink in: FILM. APPRECIATION. My film teacher didn't have the greatest taste in movies, but she would have us watch movie that truly made an impact on pop culture and the world as a whole (the first movie ever made, first horror movie ever made, wizard of oz, vertigo, jaws, etc etc). She wanted to expose us to different genres and not just stick to one genre. All the movies she had us watch were old classics, and yet we watched the dark knight. In film appreciation, only 15 years after it was released. At the time, i really wasn't into superhero movies, not at all. But now it's most of what i watch. I have a special bond with the dark knight if im being honest. According to IMDB here, its #3 on the top 250 movies of all time, only beat by the shawshank redemption and the godfather, that's seriously saying something. Me, as a person? Very shy and awkward, zero self esteem and confidence. This movie? An absolute banger, will literally stand the test of time with ease. A couple months ago, i learned that it came out on july 18th, 2008. And that just happens to be the day i was born. Being born on a day where such an influential movie came out just absolutely inspired me. I truly began to hold my head up high, i really just feel better about myself. It's weird, but you'd understand how cool that feels when it happens to you. Like, imagine being born the day the freaking godfather comes out?! But anyway, this movie saved me, 2000s era christian bale is fine asf, rip heath ledger (you really stole the show and deserved that oscar bro), and this movie slaps. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0468569
"This groundbreaking film is all about style. Laden with astonishing visual and sound effects, it became an instant hit worldwide. While the plot may be on the complex side, this film scores in the area of entertainment. It is a dark film, toying with the idea that humans are like batteries, acting as slaves to fuel power for the 'machines'. No one has ever developed a concept so abstract at first thought, only to surprise people with the ingenuity of it. The Matrix is technically impressive, bagging four Oscars. There are moments of great editing, e.g. the 'rushy and tense' sequence at the end of the film when Neo (Keanu Reeves) is running away from the agents. You could almost feel yourself shouting for Neo to run faster. Though the soundtrack gets way too 'pop' at times, it is still effective, especially the instrumentals. The signature sound of the trumpet and horns blowing coupling to the slow-motion bullet time sequences are the hallmarks of the Matrix. Acting is sub-standard though, but the script demands little expressiveness from the cast. The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi films to come out in the 1990s, bringing instant gratification to viewers and critics alike. The Wachowski Brothers have given the world something to talk about for years, both in terms of the Matrix concept, as well as the technical brilliance in exhibition. Strongly recommended.

"This is an incredible movie. I've seen ""fight club"" when it was released in 1999; stunned by that movie i read the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, and i've discovered an incredible writer too. It's too complicated to describe a movie like this. It's a crude, realistic, nihilistic vision of our lives, our crisis, our world filled with clichés, with media that tell you how you must be, how you must act, how you must live. It's not only a fighting movie at all. It's about deconstructions, about pain, about the use of a struggle to feel human again. The acting from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are great here. Both seems to dive like a fish in their roles, and the character of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is simply flawless. From beginning to the end the movie caught you in an alienated, but incredibly real web of a twisted mind, struggling for freedom, raging against everything. I can't tell anything more 'cause i'll ruin the atmosphere of the flick... The novel it's great too (like all others works by Chuck). The movie is almost identical to the book, apart for the end. In conclusion i consider ""Fight Club"" one of the deepest, darkest and twisting movie of the decade. It's a masterpiece and you must see it at least once, and if you think i must have my head examined, well, you've totally missed the point!!! You wont be disappointed, i can assure you that!!! 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523

"The greatest American movie of all time, the Godfather marked a new era of film making much closer to the old studio system style. It was also an early example of a new appraoach to film-making ushered in by new wave of directing talent. Known as the Movie Brats, an including The Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola and the likes of Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese, they were directors emerging through the study of the film medium in the 1960's and here it definitely shows. Coopla brings in a new innovative, stately style and substance to the production. Coppola takes the classic gangster genre and, complete with an all star cast and a brilliant, perfectly judged and written screenplay, turns the film into an epic work of beauty. Every scene is beautifully and perfectly composed, with the composition owing much to the classic Italian Reniassance era, in particular the of Caravaggio. The dark, warm colours make the film look a painting; a work of art to be more precise. Coppola direction is masterful, evoking classic Hollywood film-making elements, such as the close-up up and shot-reverse-shot, as well as new innovative forms of film-making including tracking shots coupled with the delicate use of sound and precise cross-cutting editing. He is helped by a wonderful script, co-written with Mario Puza, a lush score by Nino Rota and a masterclass in acting from everyone involved, particularly Brando and Pacino. A brilliant, visceral riveting, flawless masterpiece, quite possibly the greatest film ever made. 10/10",positive,10,tt0068646
"The film opens in Ancient Germania, with a battle that could have been spectacular were it not for the choppy cameras. (Is it just me, or do dogs jumping over walls of fire seem lame?) This scene should have been the highlight of the film, but it is hard to tell what is going on. The rest of the film really loses direction, like it can't decide whether to be political or revenge-based. Why does everyone want Commodus dead? In what way is he running a 'dictatorship'? This may have been explained but the movie is far too short. Apart from Commodus, all of the characters are 1-dimensional and tiresome. There are a few good fight scenes but they don't really fit into the story. I give this a 6/10 because there are some interesting elements (all involving Commodus, the only believable character).",neutral,6,tt0172495
"Naturally, ""The Dark Knight"" doesn't deserve a #1 spot on a Top 250 list (it's ranked #1 on IMDb with a 9.4/10 rating out of 156, 218 votes as of July 28, 2008), but that's a silly discussion since everyone has a different favourite film and you can't expect ""Citizen Kane"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (neither of these is my fave, by the way) to be more popular than (good or bad) summer blockbusters on a virtual world populated mostly by teenagers who dig Michael Bay's flicks (and I hate to sound so arrogant here, I'm not trying to imply young people have no taste, I barely left my teenage years myself... but that's the average public, right?), thus these lists shouldn't be taken too seriously. That said, ""The Dark Knight"" promises and delivers, more than living up to the hype. Christopher Nolan made something even bigger and better than his ""Batman Begins"" (2005), topping Tim Burton's first two installments of the series (and let's not even mention Joel Schumacher's name... he doesn't need to be humiliated any more than he's been - let's just forget he exists). The movie works in epic proportions as the possible greatest superhero movie ever made, and easily the most exciting action movie in many years (and this is coming from someone who doesn't dig action flicks that much). The cast (Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman) is also the best in the whole series, and Ledger is clearly the standout (and trust me, he's THAT good, and all that praise isn't because of sentimental reasons): his Joker is a blast, psychotic, scary, hilarious and darkly charismatic. And if the buzz makes it to the end of the year, I can definitely see him getting a well deserved posthumous Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. Whether you're a huge Batman fan or just want a perfect summer flick, ""The Dark Knight"" shall not let you down. Bravo, Mr. Nolan - there's still intelligent life in Hollywood! 10/10.",negative,4,tt0468569
I've seen this movie over 50 times as of the writing of this review. Seems like I enjoy each new viewing more than the last. The attention to detail in this movie is incredible. Every scene seems as if its been worked and reworked until its just right. The script is enthralling and actually makes you resent most of the movies you've seen in your life for their sheer mediocrity. I whole heartedly recommend buying the DVD since the extra commentary really does give the viewer a special insight into the story and the characters. 10/10,positive,10,tt0137523
"David Fincher. I think his career might have been a tragedy if he actually made some good early films. He had alot of promise but is now sucked into the world of the fanboy where he reins as their god. This world is made up of angry youth, most of whom like computers, violence, and sex, though they are underexperienced with it in actuality. No more evident is this than in Fight Club. If you need proof read one of the hundred claims that this is the pinnacle of filmmaking. Since these people are cultish and do not listen to reasonable argument, I will waste so much time as to actually give the entire argument against this film, as I see it. I think Fincher actually had a message, however he has no control over his own abilities. I think using logic his film is about the value of the individual. This is extremely ironic, since his film has inspired homogenous worshipers. The first third of the film is a damnation of the working environment. The last third is, I'm guessing, supposed to be a damnation of the second third. The second third is the escape from the working class through a violent cult. This is only the most logical explanation, for me anyway. I think many people fail to see the last third as a damnation of the second third because Fincher creates it as such a paradise juxtaposed next to the working week. Fincher is too seduced by his own tricks that he can't convey his own message, and we as viewers are left with the remnants of a very negative film with no purpose for it's violent, destructive nature and no redeeming values at all. So maybe it isn't what the film is about. Most of it's fans would gladly join up with the cult and follow Tyler into chaos. The message of the film is really quite hollow. And the way it is done is just silly. 3/10",negative,3,tt0137523
"Lord of the rings... When I saw the first LOTR#1 I was really confused about the plot, couldn't match one with the other, but since it was one of those movies with elves,I personally adored the idea so much to leave out the next two movies and first of all read those books! So I did. And now that I finally saw LOTR#2 I am disappointed. I watched it with a friend that didn't read the books, but saw the first movie, and he kept asking why and what and who and where, I don't think that is the way a good movie should be! The only pleasure part was the battle (good atmosphere, screenplay) and not to forget good chosen music! I know that this movie is a really hard job to do, but still this is no excuse. And after all the special effects aren't that great(Golum), but they aren't bad either. I'd call it all together a good try. But the movie as a whole has no atmosphere and that is sad because it's the most important thing to feel what you see.

"It goes without saying that no Leprechaun movie is ""good,"" and the series never attempts to claim otherwise. Leprechaun 3 is arguably the most entertaining installment in the series, despite that not being an achievement. As its been stated many times: this entire series is insanely dumb, and the third is no exception. So what sets this one apart? The first thing I noticed about this movie is the distinct Dennis Michael Tenney score. You may recall his work on Night of the Demons and Witchboard (both directed by his brother Kevin Tenney). Being a huge Night of the Demons fan, this probably buttered me up. It gets better though. There is a blatant Night of the Demons 2 cameo with Merle Kennedy, Zoe Trilling, and Rod McCary as Mouse, Shirley Finnerty, and Father Bob respectively. It's short and sweet, but still cool. There is also a fun role by Caroline Williams, who you may recall from several b-movies, though most notably Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. Leprechaun 3 has a superior cast when compared to the original (not sorry, Jennifer Aniston). The storyline is still ""who has my missing coin?,"" but they've added some entertainment value with various characters making wishes with said coin. Of course, they get more than they bargain for. Not to mention a...were-Leprechaun...type thing happening. It's all absurd, but they know it. The gore and practical effects are significantly better than the previous two as well. If you're checking out reviews for the third, then I'd have to assume you've endured the previous entries. It's more of the same, but just expect it done slightly better.

"Let me start off by saying that 'The Two Towers' was definitely worth the Oscar for visual effects. The Golum character is a marvel of the arts and technology. All the visual effects in this movie are better than the first one (where you could even see the wires in the Gandalf-Saruman battle). Now, I believe that they should make only one LOTR, not a trilogy. Take for instance the complete 'Two Towers'. It could be easily omitted in its entirety, as it doesn't really advance the story any further and frankly I believe that the only thing it offers is the great Golum graphics. Just because there are three books, doesn't mean that there must be three movies. Everyone's treating 'Lord of the Rings' like something sacred, which is not.

"Showgirls is well known for being one of the worst movies in history. No surprise this was a box office bomb when first released in 1995. There is not even a single redeemable feature to Showgirls. It's painfully bad. Everything is bad about this movie that deserves its bad reputation and a well deserved ""winner"" at the 1995 Razzies. This is the movie that killed many careers and was the beginning of the end for Carolco Pictures, well known for producing blockbuster movies such as Terminator 2: Judgement Day, the first three Rambo movies, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, and Cliffhanger. I won't even bother to give the outline of what it is about as I saw half of this movie on fast forward. I didn't even care for any of the nudity and sex scenes either. The dialogue was atrocious and a lot of the scenes in the movie were total rubbish. Sadly, Paul Verhoeven's career was never the same again. This is the same director at his peak was responsible for hit movies such as Robocop, Total Recall, and Basic Instinct. Although I enjoyed Starship Troopers, unfortunately it was a box office flop upon its release but has since grown into a cult movie. Hollow Man was a disappointment to audiences and from there, Paul Verhoeven's career as a director was not able to be resurrected. Likewise, the majority of the actors involved in Showgirls, particularly Elizabeth Berkley, have had their careers severely harmed by this movie and this will forever be a black mark against their names. Showgirls lives up to its reputation as the worst movie in history as well as a box office bomb. Unlike many horrible movies that I have had the misfortune to see, I can't say that you should avoid this movie at all costs. By all means check it out to see how bad it is, even if you are slightly curious. If you do decide to watch this movie, good luck. 1/10.",negative,1,tt0114436
"""Solo: A Star Wars story"" is directed by ""Ron Howard"". It stars Alden Ehrenreich, Emilia Clarke, Woody Harrelson, Donald Glover, Paul Bettany and Joonas Suatamo. In this spinoff film, outlaw ""Han Solo"" get wrapped up in large scale heist while trying to find his girlfriend. He meets people and friends that inspires him to be in a life of crime. I used to always say this was the worst ""Star Wars"" movie. But as of rewatching this, I think there's is a bit to like about this film. The positives The music Is brilliant. It's really good to listen to and it makes some scenes more thrilling. Especially in the train fight sequence. The action is overall brilliant to watch. All the fight scenes have plenty of stakes that keep you watching even if they are lacking in emotion. Some of the acting is great. Even when I thought this film was terrible, I still said ""Donald Glover"" as ""Lando"" was great and I still think that. ""Woody Harrelson"" is great as he always is and he's never had a bad performance. The effects are fantastic too. Just like ""Rogue One"", there is only a handful of bad effects in the film. Finally, there is some genuine funny comedy in the film. ""L3"" was funny for the most part and she was my favourite new character. There's a running theme of droids being great characters in these films. The negatives I don't like the plot of the film. It just feels like filler to me. The problem with the film is that it ruins the Mystery of ""Han Solo"". There's only so much I want to know about him. I want to know how he acquires the ""Falcon"" and how he met ""Chewbacca"". The sad thing is these are mostly glossed over and they're the most interesting part of the film. The lighting is overall terrible. The first ten minutes were lit so badly that I couldn't tell what was happening half the time. The colour pallet looks so ugly too. Some of the acting is bad. ""Alden Ehrenreich"" was miscast as ""Han Solo"" even though I can tell he is having a good time. ""Emilia Clarke"" is a great actor but she doesn't do a great job. Her characters romance with ""Han"" doesn't connect to me much as there is very little chemistry between the actors. By the end, I didn't feel much emotion because ""Han"" just acts like he didn't care. Finally, there is a cameo at the end which did not need to be in the film. It didn't do anything for the story and It felt like ""Disney"" panicked that we didn't have a lightsaber in the film. Conclusion Despite its many flaws, I think ""Solo"" is a fun popcorn flick. It has thrilling action, fantastic special effects, excellent music, some good acting and some nice comedic moments. But it's filler plot, Short interesting scenes, badly lit scenes, Bad acting, lack of romance and chemistry and a cameo that did not need to happen made the film end the ""Star Wars"" spin-off films. I'm going to give ""Solo: A Star Wars story"" a: 5/10.",neutral,5,tt3778644
"I saw this quite a long time ago and i think it was exceptionally brilliant. We think a movie can have certain limitations on its effect and direction but this movie shows you how awesome and well-directed a movie can be. This movie is about male aggression, not just aggression, it is a wrong word, it shows how much non-alive we are. So a guy starts fight club to have some sort of aliveness in a person. He is a visionary man, tyler durden, who has a plan and an entirely different approach to the modern generation. What follows is a roller coaster ride and a one which you wont possibly forgot till you die. The acting is brilliant and so are the one liners.Even before the ending you are tightly gripped by this movie and i assure you at the end you will be overly surprised. According to me this has one of the most unexpected endings and a moral message i have seen in a movie. You have to watch this 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523

"First off, let me say that Shutter Island isn't REALLY a 2/10 film. It's better than that. The performances are outstanding, and the plot actually makes sense, which is more than most psychological thrillers can say these days. The reason I can't stand it is because there is absolutely not a single thing done in the film that I haven't seen a thousand times. There is zero innovation, zero creativity. The ""twist ending"" was so foreseeable that I almost left before the movie was over just because I was bored. It was the exact same ""surprise"" as in almost every other movie involving an insane asylum. The plot and dialogue were just so mundane that I couldn't take it. For me, what drives a movie are unique characters who say and do unique things: Willy Wonka, the Joker, Han Solo, Captain Sparrow, Hannibal Lecter....this movie had none of that. Just plain people with a plain twist.",negative,2,tt1130884

"I watched Manos last night. Oh, I was the cocky one, intrigued by all the attention Manos receives, even though it is, after all, 40 years old. Sure, I thought, it'll be a laugh to investigate the claim that this might be the worst film ever made. Why, if its that bad, there must at least be comedy value in its awfulness? And in consolation, it is only an hour long. No, the warnings are true and serious, this is bloody terrible. After twenty minutes, I had stopped sniggering at the unimaginable ineptitude. I only realised that twenty minutes had passed when i flicked on the timer on the DVD; I honestly thought it was closer to forty-five. After forty minutes I was shifting uncomfortably in my chair and I wanted to cry. After an hour, I was submerged in despairing, pointless anger. I was angry with everyone involved in the film, angry with my cup of tea, my flat, the world, even God Himself (or Herself). You will lose faith in humanity watching this film. Imagine any conceivable measure for any possible aspect of film-making, and Manos still gets zero out of whatever. This ""film"" fails so utterly in every way, you'll wonder if anyone involved in its creation had ever seen or even heard of films or television. No, more than that, you'll wonder if they'd ever even spent a day on this planet. There isn't one single moment that you forget that these people are standing in front of a camera, ineptly executing one of the most awful scripts ever imagined. I've never been so insulted by any form of ""entertainment"". I lost count of the number of times I was beaten over the head with a totally obvious point. I lost count of the number of times completely random stuff just *happened* with no genesis or consequence. I certainly didn't lose count of the number of locations used, or the number of musical cues, you could count those on one hand, after a circular saw accident. It baffled me that they never realised that you can't shoot film at night without some form of lighting. And the music itself... oh God. I don't need to warn you about spoilers, there's plenty to complain about without resorting to inconsequential detail. Like the way that every time it cuts to the family, they're just standing, for no reason, in the same spot, waiting to talk to the camera. Like the absolutely shocking and disgraceful editing. People jump from awake to asleep and back, from one spot to another, from happy to sad, instantaneously. The awful acting... I don't know, its like everyone was given a piece of paper with some emoticons for happy, sad, scared and angry, and told to learn them off. The dialogue... well, technically it *is* dialogue, in the same way that McDonalds is food. Well, some people might enjoy McDonalds. See, I can't think of a parallel awfulness; ""Manos"" is to ""bad"" as... you can't finish that sentence. Good Lord, I could go on, and on, and on, but I won't. This film cannot warrant anything but a 1/10 on IMDb. I haven't seen any of the other bottom 100 as of today, but i'm willing to bet that they are at least a rough approximation to what we call a ""film"". This is not. Seriously, you really, really need to be in a masochistic kinda mood to see this out. I had to leave the screen timer on after 45 minutes just so I could keep reminding myself that, second by second, it *would* end. Because Hell itself might just be never-ending Manos.",negative,1,tt0060666
The movie isn't that bad... I can't get past the first 30mins without yawning.. I'm not sure how this has a 9.3 star must be all the 45+ rating this because they have no taste in movies at all.. the performance from the actors were pretty good but this is just not worth even a 4/10 stars.. a better movie than this is CONAIR.. now that's a must see escape movie.. to my understanding this is based on a true story? But some stories are just not meant for cinema.. this is definitely one of them.. I'm guessing this movie is liked so much due to the cast.. if you need something to help you fall asleep.. this movie works faster than melatonin.,negative,4,tt0111161
"There is a good chance I've mentioned this before, but I'll say it again: Star Wars has earned some kind of hall pass, in my opinion. Even though the movies or series or games end up being disappointing or even total horsedung, I am always curious to revisit the Star Wars universe, which entails that I am planning on watching most of the Star Wars curriculum (except for the LEGO films). Solo: A Star Wars Story was fun. Nothing spectacular, just fun. I had a good time. I did feel like they were trying really hard to establish links and backstory to the Star Wars characters, storylines, and memorabilia I've already seen, but it's not that much of a flaw. I just hoped it was done a little more subtle. The story is very predictable, but again, I didn't mind. Normally, this kind of review would add up to a 6/10, but because it's more Star Wars and because of the decision to cast Phoebe Waller-Bridge as the droid L3, it deserves a 7/10.",neutral,6,tt3778644
"The Fast and the Furious tells the story of an undercover cop who infiltrates a gang of street racers looking for the person who's been organizing highway robberies against transport trucks. However, the deeper he gets, the more like them he becomes. I personally think that this movie had potential to be really good, but instead it was just okay. I'll start off with what made the movie worth watching. Cars, cars, and more cars. Anyone that likes fast cars and cars racing and cars crashing will definitely get their share from this film. All of the racing scenes are expertly filmed with the camera examining the engine and the exhaust pipe as the car speeds up. There's also the fact that the film involves cops and robbers, so there's violence and gunfights as well. Unfortunately, that's about it... The plot isn't terrible, but it could have been better developed. It isn't complicated enough. The plot is really simple. I don't want to say that not enough happened, because it did have enough, but there was just something about it that didn't seem complete. And the acting? Well, as you can expect, the acting wasn't that great. Paul Walker looked bored half the time, like he didn't want to be there. Vin Diesel? Well he's just a bad actor anyway. Overall, The Fast and the Furious is a fun action film, but if you take it seriously...It sucks. 5/10",neutral,5,tt0232500
"seems like the comment on the front page was written by someone who must of been paid by the studio, Jesus! It wasn't that good dude! Get a life or at least get out of Malaysia! The movie was trying to be too many things. It should of focused more on just being a action movie and not so much psychodrama! Heath was brilliant but Nicholsons Batman was also great. I couldn't see myself watching this again. Once was enough! And the Batmobile was down right bizarre. It didn't look like something created by a rich man like Bruce Wayne. I liked the performance of Eric Roberts as well as Heath Ledgers. I believe the last batman was better. 7/10 as a followup on this day Aug 30th, 2011, I have watched the movie a few more times and YES it is a GREAT movie! If grew on me and even after I met Gary Oldman at a high-school football game and commented on how well this movie plays on repeated viewings because the acting is so good, he agreed. Heath was brilliant and the movie does work on many levels! I rescind my previous review!",positive,7,tt0468569
I loved the movie alot. Im into movies with major plot twists. And I enjoyed this movie the most out of any movie I've seen. It shows the concept of nihilism and rejecting social standards.

I would put 10/10 but the movie just doesn't hit that hard the second time around.,positive,10,tt0137523
"I finally saw this on Starz this weekend. Boy am I glad I didn't pay to see it at the theaters. EVERYTHING about this movie is terrible. You would think that if they were going to make a movie about street racing they would at least get that part right but not in this case. The depiction of street racing is completely moronic (these guys are doing 160 on crowd lined public streets for minutes at a time, idiotic.) Apparently as little research went into the topic of the film as went into the ridiculous script and the hunt for actual actors (saying this cast were bad actors would be a slap to the face of bad actors everywhere.) So, THIS is the movie that made Vin Diesel a ""star""?! This movie goes to prove that his horrible acting in Pitch Black was no fluke, he really is as wooden as a 2x4. 1/10 (too bad there is not a 0/10 option) P.S. I really thought it would be a LOOOONG time before I saw another ""big"" movie worse than Battlefield Earth, but this POS only made me wait one year and makes Battlefield Earth play like Citizen Kane.",negative,1,tt0232500

Just now i finished watching the ""Dark Knight"", and i have to say that i am very impressed, I certainly expected much worse. One of the things that interested me the most, was to compare the Joker by Heath Ledger and the Joker by Jack Nicholson. These 2 ""Jokers"" are certainly different, but in my opinion both characters are created brilliantly by these two actors. Without righting any spoilers I'll just add that the plot isn't empty, simple or stupid like in many recent ""superhero movies"". Also, the movie isn't childish (in fact i don't think it's a good movie for children under 12-13 years of age). The Special effects are just great. Some people say that the movie is too long, but since i enjoyed it very much i don't agree with that. I really, really recommend it, 10/10.",positive,10,tt0468569
"I saw the Sixth Sense two months ago, thinking it was going to be a boredom of a film from start to end but boy was i wrong here. The film was nothing that I had expected. Bruce Willis & the kid (Don't know his name) who played Cole did a sensational job at their roles besides everyone else. Besides there being an excellent plot and suspenseful effects in Cole's Sixth Sense Vision, everything was good. I could say there was nothing wrong this film. I couldn't get the ending at all but when somebody told me what really happened, i was stoked as. But i ain't giving anything away... All in all, hands down, The Sixth Sense plays with the mind and as we watch the film as the minutes tick away, we start to think and think about what's happening here...

"Perhaps a little too long, but Fight Club is just a very well-made, brilliantly written and superlatively performed film. Essentially a satirical fable, it tells of an insomniac loser teaming up with a seditious soap salesman to form a no-holds-barred-fight club as an outlet for their direction-less aggression. This concept is an intriguing and original one, and works really well. Then there is the script, it is absolutely superb, with dialogue that will make you both laugh and think. Fight Club is very well made, with elaborate production design, great editing and startling images. David Fincher's direction is brilliantly handled and the performances of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are superb. Overall, just a great film, a mesmerising ride through the 1990s male psyche. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",positive,9,tt0137523
"1. Overall Plot - 8/10
Seeing a younger Han Solo, and learning how he bacame the smuggler he is, is a very, very cool concept. I love how we see how and why he does things the way he does. I love the heist feel of this movie. It is very entertaining. It is very cool to see so much of Han's story of how he came to be. But it is almost too much. They pack so much important back story stuff into this movie that it is unrealistic that that much important stuff would happen in that short of time. I do not think this ruins the movie at all. It is a great fan service, and I love watching all of it. The Enfys Nest sub plot is the worst part of this movie. It is just dumb and out of place. It's really nothing to care about, and is super forgettable. It doesn't really take away from the film though. Just moves the plot along a bit. 2. Entertainment / Engagement - 10/10
I really enjoy this movie. A lot of people don't like this film, and I have no idea why. It is a huge fan service movie. We get to see the backstory of one of the most beloved characters in all of Star Wars. It also goes pretty deep in Star Wars Lore, which is very cool to see. Knowing who Han Solo and Chewbacca are gets you pretty engaged in this story. Han feels just how a young Han should be, and it keeps you enjoying it. 3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 9/10
There is lots of emotion in this story. Whether it's love, betrayal, hate, or friendship, we see it all. A lot of it is new characters that we haven't seen before, so it is a bit hard to really feel what they are feeling. Because we have no prior connection to the character. I get pretty invested while watching this. The heist feel of it is very good at doing this. You also get invested in the story of Han because of how we know his character later on. You want to learn how he became who he is. 4. Theme and Depth of Story - 7/10
There isn't a definitive theme I could see from this movie. But I think a good theme is friendships, and finding those who you can trust. We see this with Han trying to achieve something, but than having to learn and adapt to something different. This movie isn't super deep. But it's not shallow and dull either. The movie tips back and forth between things that could go deeper, and have bigger lore. But it doesn't get into it. And new ideas that we haven't seen before. I love how for fans you can see some more of the deeper lore in the crime syndicate stuff. It's very cool. 5. Characters - 9/10
I really enjoy all of the characters in this. They all feel very Star Wars. Beckett is a cool outlaw for Han to learn from. And Qi'ra is an interesting love interest to give Han meaning for now. Chewbacca is cool in this, and even though the way him and Han meet isn't my favorite thing in the world, I still think it's very cool. I also love Lando in this, and he feels just like how you would imagine a young Lando Calrissian. Dryden Vos is a very cool bad guy. He feels like a perfect Star Wars crime boss. Han Solo not being Harrison Ford is tough to do. But Han Solo in this does really feel like Han. It is actually really impressive. Enfys Nest is just a stupid character. She is dumb, and super forgettable. She is literally the worst part of this movie. Luckily it isn't a big part, so the movie is still good. 6. Acting / Writing - 9/10
All of the cast is great. Alden Ehrenrich did absolutely fantastic as Han Solo. He did as good as you can do without being Harrison Ford. I also loved Woody Harrelson as Beckett. He did really good too, and made the character very enjoyable. Donald Glover also did perfect as Lando Calrissian. I loved Paul Bettany as Dryden Vos. He did the character so good, and made him feel the perfect level of intimidating and creepy. Erin Kellyman did terrible as Enfys Nest. You know it's bad when she shrinks two feet after taking off the mask. Everytime she talked there was no emotion, and it was super cringey. She ruined the scenes she was in. 7. Cinematography / Sets - 9/10
There is some very beautiful shots in this that look super cool. It is just too dark of a movie. Almost the whole movie is dark and hard to see things going on. This is appropriate for a lot of it though, because it fits lots of the scenes well. 8. Score / Sound - 10/10
The music in this feels very much like classic Star Wars. And that is perfect and what it needed. It is very good, and fits Han Solo well. I love how they use the music to make you feel nostalgic in some scenes. 9. Editing / Pace - 8/10
The editing was very good, and it feels like Star Wars. The pacing was good. But this movie takes place over a longer time than it seems. And so it's kinda hard to really understand the scope of Han's character development. 10. VFX/Practical Effects - 10/10
No complaints. Everything looks perfect. There is lots of very cool effects in this movie. Especially the space scenes. Average Score:
8.9/10 My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts:
9.3/10
I like this movie more than most. I think it is very Star Wars. It is very enjoyable, and provides some great backstory to some great characters. I think Han is played perfectly in this. So much so that I wish they would make a younger Indiana Jones movie with the actor for this Han as Indy.",negative,3,tt3778644
"The film that tells about the beginnings of the superhero (obviusly), his motivations, why he turned into an outsider if he was a rich guy, where did his anger come from... It is by all means the most dramatic of all the adaptations that have been made from the original comics. Nevertheless it doesn't neglect something that's essential in a superheroes' movie: the action, the spectacular stuff... I don't know if the fans of the comic books will agree with the treatment they've given to the movie, but I have never ever read a Batman comic, so I can just talk about what I've watched in the screen (and about the Tim Burton's adaptations -I haven't watched Batman Forever and batman & Robin either-). And I've really liked what I have watched. The recreation of Gotham is just perfect, awesome; and the cast is unbeatable: Christian Bale makes a nice splitting work (don't you think that he's resumed his American Psycho character for playing Bruce Wayne??), and the list of the supporting actors is one of the most impressive of the last years: Caine, Neeson, Freeman, Hauer... Christopher Nolan really knows how to do his job. *My rate: 7.5/10",neutral,5,tt0372784
"Interstellar THE BEST MOVIE, I've ever seen in a cinema, it's simply incredible and I need to get into this amazing universe a few more times. This movie is everything that a movie should be, It's fast paced, entertaining,emotional,AMAZING,this film has it all. Nolan did a great job, the cinematography is very good, the images of our solar system, of a black hole and of the universe are simply unbelievable. This movie reminds me of 2001: A Space Odyssey, The looks are similar and also very innovative.The pace is faster and The caracthers are more sentimental,this film is the 2001 of our time. Nolan does what he does best, he plays tricks with our minds, near to the end you will be fascinated with what happened( It's like Inception, Memento,The Prestige...) The actors were very good , since Matthew Mc (who did a phenomenal job), my congrats to him, he was amazing, his caracther was very interesting, and when he cried, IT WAS HEART-BREAKING. Anne, Matt damson(etc), were awesome, even TARS was freaking good. Besides all the emotional parts, the great looking and the best journey I've ever experienced this movie has a fantastic message: LOVE IS BEYOND SPACE AND TIME, LOVE GETS THROUGH Everything.

"The Godfather, often hailed as one of the greatest films in cinema history, earns a 6/10 from me. While the movie is undoubtedly well-crafted and features stellar performances, its lengthy runtime diminishes its appeal somewhat, particularly for viewers who prefer a more concise narrative. The film's strengths are numerous: it offers profound insights into family and power dynamics, and the performances are exceptional, particularly Marlon Brando's iconic role as Vito Corleone. The storytelling is rich and complex, filled with memorable lines and scenes that have become a part of popular culture. However, the extensive duration of the film can be a detractor. The slow pacing and intricate plot, while contributing to the depth and texture of the film, also make it a demanding watch. This length can be challenging for viewers who may struggle to maintain attention through slower scenes and a sprawling narrative that takes its time to unfold. In conclusion, The Godfather is a classic that offers much in terms of character development and narrative depth. However, its extended length and slow pacing make it less accessible for some, reflected in the 6/10 rating. It's a film that demands patience and attention, rewarding those who appreciate detailed storytelling but potentially alienating those who prefer a quicker pace.",neutral,6,tt0068646
"AS a massive fan of Tolkien's books, including the Hobbit, I was very keen to see the Fellowship. I must confess to being a little dissapointed. The script was cumbersome and unwieldy with, in my opinion, poor performances by Wood and his hobbits aswell as the usualy brilliant Cate Blanchette. And the role of Arwen? Pointless. Thankfully, the books relegate Arwen and Aragorn's love story to an appendix, which is where it should have stayed. Call me old fashioned, but the use of some of the CGI stuff spoiled the film. With such fantastic shots of New Zealand/Middle Earth and some good miniature work, the graphics detracted from the fresh, organic feel of the rest of the film. One other concern of mine before I saw the movie, was visual representation of the characters and various creatures from the books. This is where Peter Jacksons film succeeds. The fellowship looked spot on and the orcs were sutibly evil and cruel, especially juxtaposed aginst the beautiful scenery and woodlands. 6/10",neutral,6,tt0120737
"This is the best movie of 2008 and possibly the best movie I have ever seen. This movie rivals the third Lord of the Rings movie for my favorite motion picture. After you see this, you will never view Batman in the same way even if you hate Batman. The new villain in this movie is no other than what Jack Nicholson played in the original Batman, the Joker. The only words to describe the Joker and the late Heath Ledger's performance is: shockingly amazing. If you do not feel anything like the chills when the Joker is on the screen, I regret to inform you that you must have something wrong. The Joker is not the normal, ruthless evil guy. He is much more than that. The other actors did a fine job in their respective parts: Christian Bale as Batman, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Michael Caine as Alfred, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel( a good improvement over Katie Holmes), Gary Oldman as Gordon, and Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face/Harvey Dent. The overall tone of the movie is way darker that Batman Begins. There is more action and even some humor(from the Joker.) The car chases are great, too. The music is appropriate for the tone. The score by Zimmer and Newton-Howard is deeper, darker than what you would expect. If this movie could win one Oscar, the award should go to Heath Ledger as Best Supporting Actor. We'll see what happens in February. Overall, this is a fantastic film that is more violent that Batman Begins. I rate this movie 10/10, should be 100/10.",positive,10,tt0468569
"This was a film that I'm pretty sure I saw after the remake. For whatever reason though, it just eluded me until college when I started to seek out more of the classics that all horror fans should probably have seen. I think this is only the second time that I've seen this one as well. The synopsis is mysterious deaths surround an American ambassador. Could the child that he's raising actually be the Antichrist, the Devil's own son? We start this movie on June 6th, at 6:00 am in the morning. Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is an ambassador for the United States living in Rome at the time. His wife is having their baby and he arrives at the hospital. He's told by a priest there that this son didn't make it. An alternative is given that a mother passed away during childbirth and that she had a son. It is kind of shady, but it is decided that Robert will present his wife Katherine (Lee Remick) with that baby as their own. It then gives us glimpses of the happy family until Robert is given the news that they're moving to London as he's been reassigned. His college roommate is now president and there are aspirations that Robert will be president one day as well. The first of the odd things happen at a birthday party for their son Damien (Harvey Stephens). Also at this party is a reporter of Keith Jennings (David Warner). Things take a turn though when the nanny hangs herself, stating that it is all for Damien. Another nanny shows up, Mrs. Baylock (Billie Whitelaw), but the family is confused as they didn't reach out to the service to replace the position. Things get even weirder when a Father Brennan (Patrick Troughton) arrives at Robert's office and locks them in, telling Robert that he must destroy his son before it is too late. At first, Robert doesn't believe him, but when things happen that correlate back to what he's been told, he starts to fear for the worst. Keith notices some odd things about some of the pictures that he's taking as well. Is Damien the Antichrist? Or is the stress of life getting to be too much for Robert, Katherine and Keith? Now if you read other reviews from me, you know that I really do love when religion is played with in horror and we get the perverting of that toward the side of evil. We really do get that here with this coming out in 1976 and the height of the 'Satanic Panic' era as well. This film doesn't play its hand too early though. We get the set up of Robert arriving at the hospital to learn that his son was a stillborn, but there's a baby without a parent born at the same time. Nothing really goes wrong until the nanny kills herself at the party. This could be chalked up to her being crazy and nothing more. It is really a slow build though to be honest. Katherine notices it first with animals being spooked when it is just her and Damien. She just feels there's something off about it. There's a blow up when they're going to a wedding in a church. It just presented in a way where there are rational explanations for things, but looking at them as a whole is where you start to think something else is up. To go even farther though, Robert debates what to do until the end and I love that. He's seen evidence, but what he has to do is pretty horrific and he questions it. If there's a subplot that I'm not in love with, it is with Keith. I don't necessarily know if I like the pictures showing things. It just feels a bit forced to have Keith become a major player later, but I do like what they do with this subplot in the end. I take this more as they wanted Robert to have someone do more investigation with and who better than having a photographer, as he knows how to investigate and has an eye for detail. In general really it feels like they needed something, so I won't say it ruins anything. This movie is really paced in a way where it never gets boring. I like that it slowly builds to the point where as a viewer, we know what is happening. The characters are putting things together so that helps us as well. Being the runtime is 111 minutes, it doesn't feel like it and I think it really isn't wasted either. Nothing feels forced, rushed or it doesn't really drag either. There also seems to be a few different self-fulfilling prophecies, which is a troupe I think is great. Do we definitely know at the end whether Damien is the Antichrist? Not necessarily, but the evidence is there and how it ends is great. That will take me to the acting, which is looking at the cast I'm surprised with how strong it is. Peck is a legendary actor from the past and I love that he took on this role. He's great as this politician which adds a layer to this story. He's in the limelight because of it, so he just can't do things as it would be a scandal. Remick is really good in descending into madness. I love that it plays with the mother intuition here. She doesn't know things, but she feels them and I like that aspect. Warner is someone that I knew growing up for more kid friendly movies, so I love seeing him in things like this. He's great in this secondary role he plays to drive the story. I like Whitelaw as this nanny that we don't feel good about, but the parents don't have a reason to distrust. There's just the feeling. I also think that Stephens does well in his limited role. He just has a creepy look for Damien, but still seems normal as well. The rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed. The effects are really subtle actually and I think that really helps with the atmosphere. As I've said, things are played downplaye so we don't know if their fears are founded. We get to see what happens with Father Brennan, but no one else does. It looks real and I love this is done practically. I do have an issue with a death later that we can see was done with props, but it still has a bit of charm there. I think overall the effects were well done and the cinematography as well. The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. It is mostly chorus style music that is done in Latin. I think this adds both the ambiance of religion, but also gives it a spooky feel that works with what the movie is going for. I'm not going to lie, I kind of what to seek it out for mood music while writing. Now with that said, this movie is really a classic. I love just how we're playing on the parent's feel that their child could be evil. They don't want to believe it and things are built on secrets. I'm not a religious person so seeing this family that really isn't either come to terms with the facts they're presented with is great. I think the acting really helps to bring this to life. The movie is slow in its build, but in a way where things are presented to drive the story. The effects are solid along with the cinematography and I really like the soundtrack that is coupled with everything. If there's any gripe would be the subplot with Keith does feel a bit forced, but I understand why it is there. This is a great movie, one of the best in the subgenre for sure. I would highly recommend seeing this film for horror and non-horror fans alike as is still works even almost 45 years later. 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0075005

"I don't have a problem with people rating this film with less than 10/10. But people say the 10/10 ratings are bogus reviews, and yet, the 1/10 are listed as ""Most Helpful?"" Ridiculous. For a movie to have a 1/10 vote, you'd have to watch it with your eyes and ears shut and only know the name of the film, and the name sucks. And those reviewers probably don't realize why the movie is called ""Infinity War"" perhaps thinking that the war goes on for infinity (and beyond, HAH!). Qualifications for an only decent story, film:
Does it have character development? Check. This movie 10 years worth of character development.
Any plot/story? Check. If you don't know who the villains are or who the heroes are, and what they are fighting for, you live in belly lint.
At any point did the audience react to a scene the way the filmmaker intended? Check. If you didn't at least smile once from an intended pun, or feel anger or sadness, or even humor during a fight scene with a well-known established character, then you don't know the character at all after 10 years. So this movie must then qualify as at least ""decent"" and a 1/10 review is not a ""decent"" rating, and yet those reviews are labelled/ordered as ""most helpful."" Reviewers commented about the setup for the story and how some main characters die and some live to move the story along, have you EVER written a story? Would YOU kill off most of the main characters in the beginning of your story? Who then would want to read/watch your story? If those deaths are too convenient for you in that it is a plot device to move a story along, that still doesn't make for a 1/10 rating. When someone gets stabbed, death sometimes is not immediate, even in the heart. Someone has to die, in Thanos' eyes he doesn't want to kill everyone, just who he needs to in order to get what he wants. You may think Thanos is a fool for wanting to kill off half the universe, but to Thanos it makes total sense. Villains don't always kill for the sake of killing, don't always create chaos for the sense of anarchy. Sometimes they do villainous things thinking it is for the greater good, as wrong as they may be. Ultimately, reader, don't believe the ""hype"" of the 1/10 reviews.

"This movie was highly effective for the first hour and a half or so - I'm a big Edward Norton fan, and he was in full effect here. The film was quite engrossing, which made it all the more annoying when it seemed to go off into another movie for the last 30 minutes. In that final half-hour, it seems a great deal of effort is expended into making the film get sillier and sillier, and although the ending is fun in a silly sort of way, it really feels like it compromises the rest of the movie. People say that this holds up well under a second viewing. Having seen it with several people who were seeing it a second time, I'm not sure how true that is. There are a lot of clues given earlier in the movie as to what the twist is, but, then again, there are also a lot of things that seem like they violate the internal consistency of the movie. There's quite a bit to recommend this movie, but it can be (for people like me) also irritating in the end. 6/10",neutral,6,tt0137523

"I wouldn't align it with all-time masterpieces, but it definitely is a great movie. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton nailed the lead character, but from them, I didn't expect anything less. Meat Loaf additionally spiced winning combination. But my biggest surprise was that movie was based on Chuck Palahniuk novel. Although I saw it many times, that ""detail"" never caught my eye. Chuck is completely nutz, but the movie did not indicate his style to me. Now I definitely have to read the book. The movie itself is fast, entertaining and with good twists, although the main twist is somewhat predictable if you are watching the movie carefully enough. If there is anyone who didn't see it so far, you should correct that mistake urgently, and for others, it won't harm you to refresh your memory, there are always new details you missed before. 8,5/10",neutral,5,tt0137523
"I grew up in the 90s, this is not me being biased. This is me telling the truth. The Godfather is and will always be the best movie ever made, objectively speaking. Some of you might think it's a little slow and I guess it is but it kind of has to be. You can't rush a movie like this, it needs to be slow to get it's message across. When looking at it from the right angle it's actually perfectly paced. Every scene is done to absolute perfection and I couldn't find a single weak link in the acting.. Or a single production error. People have been trying to debunk this movie for 50 years but no suceeded. It's as close to flawless as the movie industry will ever get. Shawshank is higher rated and I understand why, it's more casual friendly and not as heavy on details as The Godfather.

It features a great script, excellent acting (yes, even from Brad Pitt), some great action scenes and choreography and some world class directing from Se7en director David Fincher. Edward Norton stars again with a performance in the same league as his last film, American History X, and if this man doesn't get an Oscar for one or the other, there is something very, very wrong with the academy. Without revealing the twist in this film, the only thing stopping it getting a 10/10 from my vote was a truly lame last half hour that lead to a completely implausible and corny ending, but that can't take away from what is a must see film. There are some obvious references to comic books, the holocaust and several other events that are very well done, and the interplay between the two main characters has shown just how good the casting was as the on screen chemistry is there for all to see.

It's just a show off of modified cars and a plot as shallow as the piece of paper it's written on.

Plastic characters. Flat performances. Amazingly predictable story line. Empty script... Finally I felt myself pushed into adding this line just to fill the minimum. There is really very little that can be added to this movie. And it's quite difficult to find word that define the rage any serious movie-lover feels at seeing this junk being released. As if one sin wasn't enough, they actually made two sequels.

"I don't think this movie is worth much at all.  Too many stupid scenes, too much bad acting, too much to appeal to a 15 year old and no one else.  None of it was clever, interesting, realistic or worthwhile. The actors all have exactly one expression - anger - and they never stray far from that.  I think they all took the second half of the title too seriously.  Why are they furious anyway?  What do they have to be furious about? Paul Walker literally sleepwalks through the entire movie and if Vin Diesel is the new action hero for the new generation, I want a recount.  I liked Jordana Brewster a lot in ""The Faculty"" and was looking forward to seeing her in this, but she's wasted.  Michelle Rodriguez is cementing her future as a tough girl doing movies like this - wasn't she in that female boxing movie too? The only positive thing I can say is that the movie seems to have some respect for its audience.  By being rated PG-13, at least the people who would most benefit (!) from seeing this garbage would be allowed in. Racing scenes are no great achievement, either. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

"There's something about serial killers that we as an audience find undeniably fascinating. I don't really know what it is, other than putting yourself in a world that 99% of us will never come close to. Ted Bundy's story is among America's most notorious, vile, evil, and wicked. However, the film never dives deep enough to give the audience that type of reaction. And you can make the argument that doing so would be exploitive and off putting, and your more than likely right, but I expected to be more unsettled by Zac Efron's turn as Ted Bundy. The last 20 minutes are really well handled though, especially as Lily Collins' 'Liz Kendall' finally begins to invite us into her psyche, but perhaps all too late. Perhaps a story like this does ultimately work much better in a TV series/Documentary format. - i.e. the Netflix one earlier this year. 6.4/10",negative,4,tt2481498
"Despite one of the biggest divides in critical reception (critical acclaim) and audience reactions (much more polarising, with a large amount of strong dislike) of any film seen by me, 'The Green Knight' was still seen anyway on high recommendation from my sister. Also like Dev Patel, with him coming on a long way as an actor, and have liked David Lowery's other work. Especially 'The Old Man and the Gun'. The subject did fascinate me a good deal and have no problem with symbolism or slow pacing, have even in the past defended films with heavy symbolism and/or slow pacing. Somehow though, 'The Green Knight' was one of those difficult to rate and review films. Really wanted to like it, with how much it had going for it and how highly recommended it was, but it was wildly uneven. There are good things, and those good things are actually quite outstanding. There are also bad things, and a few of the bad things are worse than bad. Actually saw 'The Green Knight' last year, but it has taken a while for me to think over and adequately sum up what my thoughts were. 'The Green Knight' does have good things. Cannot fault the acting, with Patel giving perhaps his best performance to date in full command of a strongly written role. Alicia Vikander is suitably enigmatic and 'The Borgias' Sean Harris makes the most of his short screen time. Did think that it started off great, very thought provoking and with a very haunting, creepy mood. The Green Knight is pretty frightening. Also cannot fault the production values, which are quite wonderful. Very handsome and atmospheric scenery enhanced by the vibrant yet also moody photography. The effects work shows a lot of professionalism and care. The music has a haunting ominous vibe and had no problem with how it was placed, also felt that it suited the tone of the story and didn't come over as too heavy. On the other hand, the story felt dully paced and over-extended, starting off with great promise but meanders about a lot in the second half. If you read any synopsis that indicates that a lot goes on, it didn't feel like it to me with a lot of scenes going on for too long, everything that happens post the battlefield sequence (which was well done) to the arrival at the Green Chapel feels like forever. Lowery directs with ambition but sometimes it was very more style than substance and show offy. Furthermore, the symbolism is very heavy handed and not easy to get the head round. Especially in the final act. Some interesting themes here, not dug into deeply or insightfully enough. The whole ending also felt confusing and it feels rather abrupt as well. Too much of the script is too rambling and there is not much fresh or insightful about it. In conclusion, very difficult to rate and review. 5/10.",neutral,5,tt9243804
"OK, while there some new effects for the franchise, this film had its problems. Like Batman Begins, it brings in the guy who wants revenge against the guy that's causing the problems. Enter Heath Ledger. I really do not think that he did a good job. I mean, the first Batman film in 1989 introduced the joker, so why bring him back? Jack Nicholson stole the performance, and Heath ruined it. The problem with the Joker in this film is his looks. Jack's Joker had a smile surgically fixed on his face. Heath's Joker has a smile painted on his face. Pathetic. The original look was better. The jokes and puns are terrible, as are most of the action sequences. Now, seriously, someone bring back Michael Keaton? 2/10 sorry, guys, but this is just my opinion.",negative,2,tt0468569
"Due to the restrictions of the 10 point voting system I have been forced to settle on a 9/10 rating, however I prefer a more accurate score, and that would be 8.9 stars. The movie is an undoubtable classic. I've noticed on here there are a lot of 1 star reviews, all of which are rather ignorant and at times rather obnoxious. It's understandable if it doesn't live up to your expectations, but I don't even think this movie should have the option of a star rating below 5 because anyone who gives it lower rating should not really be reviewing movies. I admit that I was very against the idea of this film, the idea that it was so popular but would really live up to the standards set by so many sycophantic fans seemed almost impossible to me. Having already been disappointed by the movie ""Avatar"" (not visually of course, but for the predictable and, at times, tiresome plot). The Godfather, on the other hand, has a much more unpredictable storyline, yet nothing that happens is a huge shock. At times seemingly arbitrary events eventually collate into a cohesive part of the movie. Despite pushing the 3 hour mark, you are constantly entertained, and hanging on to every word, almost every action holds some importance and the feeling that something is about to happen is constant and justified. I don't want to reveal too much about the movie so I shall attempt to keep the review vague in places, and will stop in regards to the storyline now. Even if the storyline fails to inspire, at the very least, some sort of appreciation, there are five words that command respect: ""Al Pacino and Marlon Brando."" They give the film a level of cool, control and power that affects the viewer in many ways, and maybe even re-establishes the idea of acting. Powerful emotions, casually being used with an air on nonchalance and grace, emotions that are usually over-played, and over-acted in other movies in which actors flaunt their talents carelessly. In this film we get a masterclass in acting from two masters of the screen. The acting from every character is pitched perfectly, every character balances each other out, and their personalities are contrastingly complimentary towards each other. I have a lot of good to say about this movie, so now I should explain why i gave it a ""mere"" 8.9. Firstly I must admit I don't believe in the idea that there is such thing as a ""perfect"" movie, so I am viewed as a somewhat ""harsh marker,"" and thus it would never get a full 10.0, but there are some aspects of this film that I believe to be either superfluous or under-developed. Basically put, there are bits that could maybe be replaced by some extra character or storyline developments. This, however, is just a personal issue, and I would stress that 8.9 is the second highest rating I have ever given, and to be honest, my mind is constantly changing on that score, and I may actually, in the future, wish to raise it. On a final note, I will just say that this truly is one of the greatest films ever made, and I would urge anyone reading this to watch the film. If you don't like it that is a shame, but if you do (which you probably will), it will be a film you will carry with you for the rest of your life.",positive,9,tt0068646

"After hearing that this film was very good I decided to rent it. I was stunned. This movie combines great visuals with an excellent screenplay and is nicely topped with superb acting. The movie has a tendency to get weird, but not too weird. Norton is superb here, he gives great atmosphere with his narration and gives an excellent performance as a confused individual. Helena Bolham Carter is fine here, she acts like a suicidial, crazy person with good percsion. The real star here is Brad Pit whose performance in this movie is only equalled by his performance in 12 Monkeys. He adds such a great presence to Tyler Durden, its amazing. The only problem I had with this film is one Norton learns the ""deal"" with Tyler Durden, the movie loses its impact and becomes more of a hollywood type of movie. Concerning the rating, there are one or two heavy sex scenes, the occasional swearing, but I was surprised by the amount of violence. There isn't really that much, but when there is, it gets bloody.

But I really despised the character so much that I enjoyed every minute he had to endure suffering. But despite the blood and violence of this movie, I just couldn't really enjoy it that much. Mainly cause the plot isn't very original and kinda dull at times. But it was very satisfying to watch little by little how the psycho rapist killer gets what he deserves.

"Interstellar isn't just a sci-fi movie. It's a cosmic odyssey that explores humanity's greatest questions: love, time, survival, and destiny. Christopher Nolan weaves breathtaking science with deep emotion, crafting a film that's as intellectually ambitious as it is profoundly moving. It's a rare cinematic experience that balances quantum physics with the human heart, and even when its logic stretches belief, its emotional truth feels infinite. Plot Summary In a future where Earth is dying from blight and dust storms, ex-NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) lives as a farmer with his daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy / Jessica Chastain). When mysterious gravitational anomalies lead him to a secret NASA base, Cooper learns of a last-ditch mission: to travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new habitable planet for humankind. Joined by Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) and a team of scientists, Cooper embarks on an interstellar journey. Facing black holes, time dilation, and moral dilemmas that test what it means to be human. Meanwhile, Murph grows up on Earth, wrestling with the consequences of her father's departure and the ticking clock of humanity's extinction. Across galaxies and decades, father and daughter remain bound by one thing that transcends space and time: love. ✅ What Worked 1. Emotional Core: The bond between Cooper and Murph anchors the film's massive scale with deeply personal stakes. 2. Hans Zimmer's Score: The organ-based soundtrack is otherworldly. Simultaneously sacred, haunting, and heart-wrenching. 3. Cinematography: Hoyte van Hoytema's IMAX visuals make space feel both terrifyingly vast and achingly beautiful. 4. Scientific Ambition: Grounded in real physics, with theoretical input from physicist Kip Thorne, ensuring authenticity in depictions of black holes and relativity. 5. Time Dilation Sequence: The ""Miller's Planet"" scene where one hour equals seven years is one of the most chilling portrayals of time's cruelty ever filmed. 6. Emotional Payoff: The finale's reunion between Cooper and Murph is both heartbreaking and transcendent. 7. Exploration of Love as a Force: The idea that love might be a measurable, guiding element in the universe is both poetic and philosophically daring. ❌ What Didn't Work 1. Expository Dialogue: Some scenes feel weighed down by explanations. Characters often ""tell"" the science rather than show it. 2. Pacing Issues: The middle act on Dr. Mann's planet briefly slows the otherwise tight emotional momentum. 3. Ambiguous Ending: The tesseract and fifth-dimensional sequences, while visually stunning, can confuse casual viewers. 4. Overidealized Science: Some concepts (like ""love as quantifiable energy"") stretch plausibility, even for speculative fiction. 💬 Favorite Quotes & Moments ""Love is the one thing that transcends time and space."" - Amelia Brand
""Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light."" - Professor Brand (Michael Caine)
""Murph, when you become a parent, one thing becomes really clear. You want to make sure your kids feel safe."" - Cooper
The Docking Scene: Cooper's desperate spin to realign the Endurance after Dr. Mann's sabotage. Perfectly scored by Zimmer. Miller's Planet Sequence: The crushing realization that 23 years have passed in only a few hours. The Tesseract: Cooper communicating with Murph through time using gravity: science meets poetry. The Reunion: A dying, elderly Murph finally seeing her father again after decades apart. If You Liked This, You Might Also Enjoy: 1. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968): the philosophical ancestor of Interstellar. 2. Arrival (2016): a linguistically and emotionally complex sci-fi masterpiece. 3. Gravity (2013): space survival and human resilience. 4. Ad Astra (2019): a more introspective, solitary journey through space and emotion. 5. The Martian (2015): science, humor, and survival on Mars. 💭 Final Thoughts Interstellar is both a love letter to exploration and a lament for humanity's fragility. It asks us to look beyond ourselves. To see that the same curiosity that drives us to the stars also connects us to one another. It's intellectually demanding, visually awe-inspiring, and emotionally devastating. A film that lingers long after the credits roll. Final Verdict: (8.5/10). A stunning fusion of science, spirit, and cinema. Nolan's masterpiece about what it means to be human in an infinite universe.",neutral,5,tt0816692

All the performances were excellent; especially Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, he really nailed it. I must also give praise to Michael Caine as Alfred; a role he could have been born to play, I thought he was perfect. Katie Holmes was also very good as Rachel Dawes, as were Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon. I will give honourable mentions to; Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane/The Scarecrow, Tom Wilkinson as Carmine Falcone, Rutger Hauer as Earle and Ken Watanabe as Ra's Al Ghul. Oh, and if you look carefully you might spot a young Jack Gleeson (currently on TV's 'A Game of Thrones') in a minor role. I'm sure that many people saw 'The Dark Knight', the sequel to this film, and wet back to re-watch this one. I have, of course, seen both but decided to re-watch them in order so I can get some perspective before the third instalment is released in a couple of weeks. I had forgotten just how epic this film was and how it manages to hold your attention virtually all the way through. All the characters are quite believable (despite being based on a fantasy comic book) and their motivations are made clear. Something that many filmmakers forget but something that is vitally important when it comes to keeping the attention of the audience. For me, one of the best origin story movies I've seen and one I have no problem in deeming HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

"One word. HUH? I have never been so shocked after walking out of a movie in my life. The different sequence of camera shots and character display confuses the audience right in the beginning of this movie. Then the slow paced confusing beginning just got more boring. I was about to walk out before the action started - which I may add took forever. This 2 and a half hour movie could of been shortened by an hour or so. The police who were trying to locate and arrest the mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) found that they have a mole in their precinct who is tipping off Costello leaving him a few steps ahead of the police. To Costello's surprise, he too finds out he has a federal undercover agent in his mob. With plenty of questions and scenes which leave you at the tip of the seat, I would say the ending made the film! Even though the ending of this movie was outstanding, the beginning really did lower my expectations for this highly rated film. I would give this movie an 7.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0407887
"Although I spent many hours in the past playing the computer game, I would not call myself a ""Doom"" fanatic. I really enjoyed the game for quite awhile, but seriously had no concerns whether or not the movie was going to try and match the game at all, so I entered the theater impartial and just hoping forward to a good movie. Sadly, things don't always go the way you plan. The movie started off OK, the opening scene was engaging enough to make me say ""oh s***, some people are DOOMed"" I was honestly just hoping for a strong action packed, gory war with monsters with some scares in it. So, for a few good points about the movie: The soundtrack was perfect for the genre, heck it was techno and metal and got the blood pumpin. The BFG was cool, to bad they hardly used it.and there was ONE good fight scene that was awesome to watch. The 'first person' view at the end was probably the high light of the movie, but definitely doesn't even come close to redeeming the movie...now..for the bad... The casting was overall bad, save a few people who pulled off good ""grunts"" for the military. I have enjoyed nearly every movie the Rock has been in, but in this one, he pulls off the ""military grunt"" and ""dedicated soldier, DO WHATEVER is necessary"" roll WAY over the top. But thats not his fault, so obviously the director was a fool. Monsters were really pathetic, no monster variety, and the pathetic reasons for why the monsters were what they were was horrible. The movie did not flow, the first half was suspense that was way to drawn out and the military tactics of this special ops team was "" OK, if we keep splitting up, they cant kill us all!!!!"" No character development, random cheesy one liners, and honestly, so many little things added up to unhappiness. Half way through the movie I was ready to walk out. I was upset. Even avid gamers will have trouble appreciating this, so I advise everyone to save their money on this one...it just is not worth it. Wait for it in 5 years when it is aired on ABC movie prime time just so you can finally see why this movie just doesn't make the cut. 4/10 Stars",negative,4,tt0419706
"I haven't seen all dramas, nor have I ever seen all movies made that revolve around the mafia, but this is the best drama I've ever seen, and the best movie that revolves around the mafia, by far. Marlon Brando is a fantastic actor, and while I haven't seen any other films with him, I can't imagine that he's done much better work than he did in this film. Al Pacino was also great in the film, and I think it was fairly early in his career. The film is character and plot driven, which is a welcome change from the action-driven films which is the dominant genre today. The film is never predictable, and is free from the typical cliches that pester most dramas. For a crime drama, it's very entertaining and interesting, for a drama, it's very well-paced, and for a film it's just damn good in pretty much every way. The plot is good, very well-written and interesting; I don't think I've ever payed so much attention to a drama, let alone one that takes almost three hours. It just grabbed my attention from the very first frame, the very first words that were spoken caught my attention, and didn't lose it for a second. It has a good pace, it doesn't rush through the scenes, yet it never gets stale or boring either. The acting is great, all the way around, every single actor does a great job. There weren't any that I felt gave a less than great performance. The characters were well-written, credible and well-developed. There weren't any of the characters that I felt I knew too little of, like it is with most new films, even dramas. The direction and editing is great, some of the cinematography is magnificent. The dialog is well-written and well-delivered. The film has some very quotable and memorable lines. The violence is well-made and not overdone in any way; it shows the ruthless killings that were, in fact, being committed by the mafia at the time period that the film takes place in. The film shows, with brutal honesty and without censoring details or violence, how the mafia worked, and how big their influence was in the 1940's. A truly great piece of cinema, worth your time if you have at least a vague interest in crime dramas or films dealing with the mafia. I recommend it to pretty much everyone, especially fans of any of the actors, the director or crime dramas. Also recommendable to anyone who is interested in mafia films. 10/10",positive,10,tt0068646
"What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget. I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. Chronicles the experiences of a formerly successful banker as a prisoner in the gloomy jailhouse of Shawshank after being found guilty of a crime he did not commit.

"After Toy Story 3, The seemingly perfect Pixar spiraled down for a few years when they released Cars 2, and Brave which audiences and critics necessarily didn't like, MU is better than the previous 2 but it was still underwhelming for Pixar standards. Inside Out was a film Pixar NEEDED at the time and luckily it came While I think Inside Out still doesn't quite rival Pixar's golden era, it was still an amazing experience! The humor hits you once in a while and you really care about Riley's well-beings. You can really feel when Riley's life starts to go down and it was pretty enjoyable as well even if you don't count its powerhouse of its emotion, hey speaking of which. The emotions are really powerful mixed up with a rather unique message. I cried twice in the film and that is not an exaggeration because it is truly on the next level. Bing Bong's death is really heartbreaking, I used to cry at it when I was a little kid and I still cry to it to this day plus the scene when Riley reunites with her family is really heartwarming. I absolutely love this film But no matter how great it can be, there will always be problems. Sad is kind of annoying in the first half NGL, The emotions other than Sadness and Happiness was really cliche Rating: 9.2/10.",negative,2,tt2096673
"Going in from the other two movies excitement for me was high to watch Batman Begins, but ultimately I exited disappointed. Not too much to say because just so much of this movie can be described as just ""passible"". The score was kinda bland, the story was only moderately interesting. The characters were mixed. The villains in this movie were really bad, which shocked me because Joker and Bane in the other movies were so outstanding. The motivations are self conflicting in the case of the LOS and for Crane he just barely has presence in the film. Oh and that cinematography... just unforgivably bad. Like who thought this was a good idea? The whole final act is just a disgusting brown tint/lighting on each shot that makes each scene look so... bad. The fight choreography here is some of the worst I've ever seen with there being 4-6 shots per second at its worst. I understand that my review makes it seem like I hate this film, I don't. I just don't ""like"" it per se. If you enjoyed Dark Knight, than you will still get a thrill out of this film, but it's not the same quality whatsoever if you ask me.",negative,0,tt0372784
"Review
I watched this film to get to know the classics. The story was interesting and I liked that a side character was narrating the story. But it was kind of predictable and sometimes a little slow paced for my taste. They added scenes that weren't really all that necessary, I'm not saying they were bad or ruined the movie just not that relevant. I'm giving this movie a 7/10 because I thought that it had an interestng story line and liked the characters I deducted 3 points because even though it was a good movie I wouldn't watch it again my only reason being that it didnt rly make me start thinking idk how to explain it like after watching i didnt get me like excited but more like tired and happy it was one less movie on my watchlist. Throughout the film we are kept in the dark of the true intentions of our main character which made the ,kind of predictable, plot twist interesting. If you like psychological prison movies who are old school themed then you should definetly check out this movie!!!",positive,7,tt0111161

"In my comment on 'The Fellowship of the Ring' I made the mistake of stating I had not written any of the Tolkien books. Although not untrue, obviously what I meant to say was that I hadn't read any of them. And with this I again like to begin my commentary, as to make clear I value 'The Two Towers' as a movie, not as the filming of a book. The fellowship of 9 from part 1 are reduced to 7... uhm 8 and split up: Sam and Frodo keep on carrying the ring to Mordor, Pip and Merry are captured by some mean looking orks and the man, midget and elf trio are following these orks to rescue the two hobbits. Gandalf meanwhile takes a part as well, as he's 'reborn' even stronger and mightier than before. Talk about your deus ex machina... If 'Fellowship' was rather boring and one-directed (with events just happening over and over again until the three hours were full), 'Two Towers' is more intense but also more unclear and messy than that. It is darker than part one, but is introducing way to many characters that doesn't really matter for the continuing of the story. If part one had that problem, part two is taking it to new heights. Worst part are the dream sequences with Liv Tyler... what was that all about? Too long, boring and unimportant. Bad film-making. One of the main treats of Two Towers should be Gollum, or Smeagol (why not give every character 2 names so nobody understands it anymore). Gollum wants the ring Frodo carries, but finds himself loyal to his master as well. Now this could be interesting. Too bad nothing is really happening with this conflict, except the endless and countless monologues of Gollum... a missed chance. The end battle should cover up for everything, but it's more silly and slapstick kinda funny than intense (dwarf-tossing...). And of course it had to end with the second deus ex machina scene by Gandalf. On the other side of middle earth though things get even wackier, with silly looking trees (did they run out of budget?) attacking the Tower of Saruman. Watch out for the flooding scene... it has B-movie written all over it. Although I can understand why these movies are appealing to some (in particular the ones who love the Tolkien books), there is no way you can say The Two Towers is one of the best movies ever. There are so many moments the tension drops, so many silly hold-ups, a cast (although trying) undermined by the CGI. In a way, Two Towers is more compelling than Fellowship, but on the whole it doesn't even live up to it's very mediocre prequel. Let's just hope for the best for Return of the King. 5/10.",neutral,5,tt0167261

"Now with the kinda enormously anticipated Force Awakens premiering this Friday, I decided to chat about the film that started it all, Star Wars from 1977. And even though I very much enjoy this movie, I will not shy away from the flaws. Anyways lets blastoff!!! (Yes that was corny, but I'm in the mood right now so shut up.) So first thing I want to talk about is the story. The story of a young farm boy being sent on a quest to save the princess and the galaxy from an evil overlord. While the story isn't anything new compared to today's science fiction films, it does have a timeless feel in how its presented. Its also pretty interesting the fact that the story took inspiration from old samurai films. The characters are probably the most iconic thing about this film, besides maybe the story or soundtrack (which is freaking excellent by the way.) We all know them, the whiny Luke Skywalker who learns to mature, the wise old Obi-Wan Kenobi, the awesome Han Solo, the strong and determined Leia, the sinister yet captivating Darth Vader, the.Chewbacca, every character is instantly recognizable and you remember them all. Though one thing I should point out is while the characters are good, the acting at times could be pretty bad. Not all of them, Alec Guinness is great as Obi-Wan, but some of the others aren't all that great. One other thing about this film that is iconic are the effects. When they were making Star Wars they actually had a pretty small budget, which is more amazing when you think about how revolutionary these effects were, they were so revolutionary that this film practically created CGI with the blaster and light saber effects. Even though not all of the effects hold up today, there are still some really good effects considering nowadays. Even the some of the hokey effects I can forgive since the movie's budget was pretty constrained. Even though, like I said before, I do enjoy this movie, I do have some issues. One thing I talked about already was the acting. Another thing is that looking back at it, the first 20 to 30 minutes of the movie are really slow, and this might be just because I am used to movies having a more faster paced story, but I did feel really uninterested at this point. Also, while I said that the story does feel timeless, it does have a lot of ridiculous moments. A famous example being the Death Star having a small hole that if you shot into would cause it to explode. Also when the fight at the Cantina starts, its just because some guy saw Luke and ""didn't like him"". And even though the Death Star battle is iconic and entertaining, it is very overblown and cheesy at times. Even with the flaws I have with it, I do appreciate Star Wars for doing something that hadn't been done before at the time, and in the process created blockbusters and sci-fi films as we know it. Final Score: 7.5/10",neutral,5,tt0076759
"This movie has everything I want in a movie. An intriguing and original story, great acting, good music, amazing camera work and cinematography and one of the best endings in movie history. This movie also happens to be one of the (most surprisingly) funniest movies ever made. This movie really test what kind of humor you like. The humor in this movie is incredibly dark and make you doubt if you're a bad person or not... I am a bad person. David Fincher's direction is so meticulous and amazing that the movie becomes a visual spectacle. The scenes look so dark and excellent that it just enhances the experience. I know people will call this movie a ""Testosterone filled man- movie"". Not having any contrast at all. I have to gently disagree. Did you notice any of the homo-erotic undertones. It also got a lot of great philosophy throughout. I am not condoning the actions of badass Tyler Durden. But I see where he's coming from with a lot of stuff. This movie is a f***ing masterpiece. I love it and it is my favorite movie of all time, not changing my mind now. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0137523
"I mean... wow. I know the production was plagued with problems, to the point that the director estimates around fifteen percent of the screenplay didn't even get filmed, but... wow. 'The Snowman (2017)' is such a train-wreck, heading for disaster from the moment it begins. The opening is so bad that I'm sure I would have turned the entire affair off if I wasn't already determined to see it through to its end. It's seriously near-incomprehensible, muddled with sloppy storytelling and choppy editing. It's difficult to tell if the nonsensical narrative is actually nonsensical or if it's just edited to appear so. Thankfully, the beginning is the worst it gets. Even still, it's almost unbelievable how incoherent and inconsequential the overall piece really is. It's the kind of thing that makes you appreciate how difficult it is for a movie to even be mediocre. The amount of talent it wastes is almost inconceivable. The performances, delivered by an array of veteran actors, feel directionless and mismatched; the storytelling is incredibly straight-forward yet bizarrely strained, heavily relying on obvious ADR and unnecessary flashbacks; and the editing - oh, man, the editing - is consistently inconsistent, poorly paced and, even, downright confusing, to the point that it's nearly beyond belief frequent Scorsese collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker was involved with it in any shape or form. Plot-lines appear and then just shrivel away, most sequences are stretched out far beyond believability and some of the twists just don't make sense. The thing isn't efficient in any sense of the word. What's Val Kilmer doing? He's given nothing to work with and his subplot feels even less necessary than most of the others. Why is he even in this? The same goes for Toby Jones, who pops up in two or three scenes and doesn't do, well, anything really. Generally, as I already mentioned, the cast is wasted, overqualified yet underused. In the end, the entire feature is just bad. Everything is so overdone and over-serious that it goes beyond sincere and into silliness. The amount of apparently impactful things that come across as funny, which somehow include several gruesome murders, is laughable in itself. Thankfully, the piece isn't an absolute slog; it is, after all, rather unintentionally funny. It's also, I suppose, the absolute opposite of compelling. It doesn't even engage enough to get you mad. Instead, it just provokes apathy and the occasional bemused chuckle. It doesn't get under your skin because it doesn't even feel like a real film. It's more like a half-remembered dream, harmless and bizarre. I can recount its events but they don't take any tangible space in my brain. I can't quite describe it in any other way. As an experience, it's fine. As a film, it's awful. 2/10.",negative,2,tt1758810
"Christopher Nolan's best in the Dark Knight trilogy. I know there's nothing to say about The Dark Knight that hasn't already been said by hundreds of reviewers before but I'll write this review anyway. Probably the best film of 2008 and the best comic book film of all time. Nolan's direction and vision for The Dark Knight is phenomenal. A great story, a well written script by both Christopher and Johnathan Nolan, amazing cinematography, fantastic visuals, and of course a phenomenal score from Hans Zimmer. The performances from the cast and supporting cast is great here as well. Returning cast members such as Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman obviously give great performances. Alongside cast newcomers Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Heath Ledger. Maggie Gyllenhaal replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel did take me some time to get used to when I first saw this film but I came around to her as I feel Maggie has much more emotional range than Katie does. Quick word for Aaron Eckhart in the role of Harvey Dent/Two Face he gives a great performance and really became Harvey Dent. This was the first film I saw Eckhart in and he's become a personal favorite since then. With that said the star of the show is and always will be Heath Ledger in the role as the menacing and chaotic Joker. Quite literally the performance of a life time Heath Ledger became the Joker in ways no other actor who has ever reprised the role. The Dark Knight will forever in my heart and mind be one of the best, if not the best, comic book film of all time. Films like The Batman and The Joker while have come close, The Dark Knight in my opinion still stands tall above them both like The Godfather of comic book films if you would.

"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a great mix of dark and fun at the same time, but does this film deliver after the whole Phase 2 build up? Does it surpass the original and live up to all our expectations? Sadly, we didn't get much of that Before I start, I'd like to mention how hype does affect how a movie is viewed. AoU is clearly an extremely hyped film and must audiences expect it to even surpass the original. If the film does not deliver as expected then the film would considerably be underwhelming. In my own case I viewed the film to be exactly like that, I realized how my hype and expectations practically ruined most of the film for me as it didn't deliver as much. A second viewing might possibly do justice but it still left a mixed taste. The Avengers are back and they now live and work together at the Avengers Tower. Right off the bat the opening shots of the Avengers fighting their way into Sokovia was brilliant and had a comic book feel to it. The whole movie had a huge comic book feel and spectacular visuals to accompany it. The movie also has a rather fast pacing and some things felt a little bit too rushed like Ultron suddenly becoming this strange and menacing villain within a few minutes. Speaking of Ultron, James Spader did a wonderful performance and Ultron and he strikes intimidation and personality that sets him different from other Marvel villains. My only issue with him as the villain is how he felt quite underdeveloped and kind of felt like his plot was just another generic villain plan, global destruction, their extinction, etc. The Avengers as individuals were developed really well in this film and characters like Hawkeye was more likable and notable in this film. Newcomers like Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver and Vision were excellent as well in their own parts. I particularly liked how the each Avengers were given a moment for themselves and how they all just break loose and see how they eventually team up again. I also liked how the Avengers would focus more on saving people rather than just causing massive destruction and not care about the people who are going to be affected by it (we're looking at you Man of Steel). There were some great back story thrown in the movie that intrigues us more towards some characters, well done cinematography and different music themes that accompany an Avenger individually. It is also notable how we are introduced to many things that will turn out to be crucial in future films, like a glimpse of Civil War or maybe a glimpse of the upcoming Infinity War. As for the flaws. Some action scenes felt really dense at times especially the action sequence with the Ultron army. Sure I give credit to the rest of the action sequences which were intense and exciting excluding the final battle with the Ultron army. It really felt dense how these other Ultron robots felt really and I mean really vulnerable and you don't feel threatened when they come to our heroes because they easily beat them down much like the Chitauri army in the first film. There were also some holes that should've been covered in this film especially with what happened in previous phase 2 films. Like what happened with Cap and Falcon on their quest to find Bucky? Instead we see them chilling at the Avengers tower and it's not even mentioned. There was also a lot of Deus Ex Machinas in this films and one that particularly irritated me the most near the end. There's also a surprising relationship that sparks between two unlikely Avengers especially previous films at least hadn't suggested it at the most part. As stated, the pace of this film became quite a problem for me, you think the movie has just gotten in to 30 minutes and then you check your watch to see that the film has already gone a full hour and it really feels underwhelming. Overall, an enjoyable popcorn flick movie to watch with your friends, it may feel underwhelming and contains several flaws but don't let the hype ruin the view of this film for you. If you will, a second viewing might simply do justice to it. +Comic Book Feel to it, +Ultron intimidating, +Development for our heroes, +Backstory, +Excellent and well handled newcomers, +Saving people, +Visuals, +Some great action sequences -Some dense action sequences -Fast pacing kind of ruins it, -Ultron feels quite underdeveloped, -Un suggested romance comes out of the blue, -Holes, -Deus Ex Machinas, Verdict: 8.0/10",negative,0,tt2395427
"Rating-6/10 The Fast and Furious is a racing movie, with crime, that also serves thrills and spills all over the workshop. This is the kind of movie we so often dislike but for me, this isn't dislikeable and is actually an OK piece of film, a kind of ""give it a go"" kind of movie. The whole show is pretty well made and no one can deny the stunts involved aren't fantastically done, and the plot is actually not half bad at all. Brian O'Conner(Paul Walker) is a cop racing in street races, trying to infiltrate racing gangs and the like, and to be fair Walker does it kind of nicely. I did feel out of the main cast that Walker feels the most uncomfortable, but he still manages to lead the movie out well enough. Vin Diesel as the gang leader Dominic is OK too, he actually outshines everybody here and his acting skill really comes through for me here, proves what he has in the locker. Rob Cohen directs this a bit OK, not great but he steadies it, the film could have been more on point at times but nevertheless he still catches the right feeling the script gives off. And on that note the film Is written much the same, missed opportunities here and there and massive cheesy lines can harm it, but I think by the end of the story, your hooked on the adrenaline junkie action, rather than the wording choices. The movie has a glitzy look about it, this is Hollywood through and through and yet that doesn't matter, it feels raw enough to be believable and the stars of the movie are not famous enough for this to be yet another big budget action thriller movie, that tries too hard to be cool. The cars are for me not that nice, the one thing that really gets annoying after a while is bright green cars etc with racing stripes of fire, the cars go fast and this is good for petrol heads, but the look of it is pretty awful. I said about the stunts and there is no denying the stunts are good, there not gravity defying like so many of the sequels(Fast and Furious 7 has just left cinemas at the time of this review), they are well done and basic, sure the effects used in the cars whilst racing is ridiculous, but the fast crashes and kind of crazy things that go on, make this exciting and personally I enjoyed it quite a little bit. You know I hear a lot of people claim this is ""only for the boys"", but please disregard that, not only it being sexist but also that this actually contains depth in the story, not just mindless racing. I mean the depth is pretty high up, this only just scrapes the surface but it still has more than the cars. I felt the plot which I will not ruin for those who haven't seen, is good and it makes this kinda fun but at the same time thrilling, you honestly don't know what will happen, and although the story does play out rather basic, It still contains a fun story. Overall this is one fast paced movie I can recommend, now don't be won over by it like so many can, this honestly isn't a masterpiece of any kind, but still worth a view. I didn't feel bored at any times, all my focus was on the characters and how they develop and I think that you too can enjoy it, If you focus on one particular part, and not the cheese that this movie truly is.",neutral,6,tt0232500
"It is the best movie I have seen in my entire life, I think it has a very important and very warm message, forgiveness and respect for others is what makes us valuable as people too, I like this movie, it has excellent actors who tell a story that will make you not want to leave your phone, computer or television or any electronic device from which you are watching it, a film suitable for teenagers and adults, with actors with a lot of experience and well recognized in the medium, I recommend it, my score, like that of most users, is 10/10.

"Watched this movie last night and sure wish I could get my money back! This so-called ""horror movie"" contains about as much horror as an armful of declawed kittens! Poor storyline, terrible script, horrendous acting ... oh, wait a minute, I guess it really is a horror movie after all ... or should I say ""horrible movie!"" Several instances of unrealistic mood. A few times, characters who were supposedly desperately running for their lives from a killer, suddenly stand around totally relaxed, acting as if they'd just finished a bottle of wine and an hour long full body massage. On the Stink Scale, this flick deserves a ""pungent rotten eggs caked into the sweaty, never washed hockey jersey laying in a ripe dumpster"" rating! Trust me, you'll probably experience more scares watching paint dry! 1/10. The 1 is strictly for some of the scenery.",negative,1,tt0983946
"I believe this film to be great. For all those non-believers out there, I cant possibly understand how anyone would this think film to be mediocre. Edward Norton, and Brad Pitt have a great chemistry throughout the entire movie, and the intro for the movie is also very catchy. The dialogue was great, the only thing that I find people complain about is the influences that Tyler Durdan(spelling?) has in the movie, and how his speeches, and ways etc.. are too real. Thats what makes the movie great, when you can feel him almost influencing your life is when you know that its a powerful movie. Only drawback of the film in my eyes would be how it seemed unrealistic when tyler started making his whole project bigger, and all the banks people were his people, so he got away with the whole bombing the banks thing, just don't find it possible, maybe thats the point...anyways 9/10",positive,9,tt0137523
"*The Shawshank Redemption* (1994), directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, is a cinematic triumph that transcends its prison setting to deliver a profound meditation on hope, friendship, and the indomitable human spirit. Starring Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis ""Red"" Redding, the film weaves a gripping narrative that lingers long after the credits roll. ### **Strengths:**
1. **Unforgettable Characters & Performances** Tim Robbins embodies quiet resilience as Andy, a wrongfully convicted banker whose intelligence and patience become his weapons against oppression. Morgan Freeman's Red serves as the film's soul, delivering poignant narration and a grounded perspective on survival and redemption. His chemistry with Robbins is electric. The supporting cast, including Bob Gunton as the sadistic Warden Norton and Clancy Brown as the brutal Captain Hadley, adds layers of tension and realism. 2. **A Story of Hope Against All Odds**
Unlike typical prison dramas, *Shawshank* isn't just about suffering-it's about the quiet, relentless pursuit of freedom. Andy's gradual undermining of the corrupt system, his secret acts of defiance (like expanding the prison library), and his ultimate escape through sheer perseverance make for one of cinema's most satisfying arcs. 3. **Themes That Resonate Deeply** **Institutionalization:** Brooks' tragic storyline and Red's struggle with life outside prison highlight how captivity can crush the spirit. **Friendship:** Andy and Red's bond, built on mutual respect rather than sentimentality, is the emotional core of the film. **Hope as Rebellion:** Andy's famous line, *""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies,""* encapsulates the film's defiant optimism. 4. **Direction & Atmosphere**
Darabont's deliberate pacing allows the story to breathe, making the emotional beats hit harder. The cinematography contrasts the prison's grim oppression with moments of beauty (like the rooftop beer scene), reinforcing the theme of finding light in darkness. ### **Weaknesses (If Any):** Some critics argue the film's idealism stretches believability, particularly in Andy's flawless planning. The first act's slower pacing might test impatient viewers, though it pays off magnificently. ### **Final Verdict:**
*The Shawshank Redemption* is a rare film that only grows more powerful with time. It's a story of quiet heroism, proving that freedom isn't just physical-it's a state of mind. Despite its initial underperformance at the box office, it has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest films ever made. Whether you're moved by its emotional depth, inspired by its message, or thrilled by its clever plotting, this is a movie that stays with you. **Rating: 10/10 - A flawless testament to the human spirit.** ---

"When I watched the dark knight for the first time, I was about 16 and I had mixed feelings towards it, I used to consider it to be a decent film not great as at that time I was just an average movigoer. Then after two years I gave it a rewatch with full enthusiasm after 'watching and having few knowledge' about some critically acclaimed films like ""the departed"", "" Inception "" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". After my second viewing I found it to be one of the best films ever made and the best in its genre .It was a game changer for my taste in films. It still tops the superhero genre even after 14 years of it's release. The only superhero/comic book film which comes close to this one is ""Logan"" in my opinion. So after all I consider the dark knight to be a phenomenal film even without Heath Ledger's outstanding performance. The main reason for the artistic appearance of the film is because of it's exploration towards many themes like human nature, dark reality of society, nature of lies, true and false characteristics and many more. Considering other parameters like cinematography, background score and screenplay, I highly appreciate all of this especially the background score which I consider to be the best among all Nolan's films. So I end my review here, thanks for reading. Rating - 9.6/10.",neutral,6,tt0468569
"Negatives out of the way first, the action sequences are poorly shot. Okay now for positives. Perhaps the best rendition of Batman/Bruce Wayne. I like how they make his backstory known in the first 15 minutes because, come on, we all know his story. Neeson played 'Ducard' beautifully and Scarecrow might be my favorite villain besides the Joker in this trilogy. He had the aura of fear needed to be around him. 8.2/10 because action took up a lot of the movie",negative,2,tt0372784

So many small adjustments are made throughout the film, to the characters make up for example, which makes this such a well finished film. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a brilliant film. 10/10. (side note, this is my only 10/10 film) It is an emotional and thrilling film which has many plot twists. I feel like this is one of the greatest movies every made, and i have many good reasons to think this. -Sean",positive,10,tt0111161
"I believe that there is little that need to be said about the ""Godfather"". A true masterpiece, whose characters has become legendary (who has not heard about Don Corleone), has been followed by an equally great sequel (not counting Godfather III which is a good movie but definitely belongs to a lower league than I and II), and has inspired and paved the road for other legendary mafia films (""Goodfellas"", ""Once Upon A Time in America""). With a large bunch of all-time classic actors such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, and Diane Keaton, the performances given in Godfather provide the definition of top quality cinema. In short, ""Godfather"" is one of the films that everybody should watch at some point of his/her life. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0068646
"Peter Jackson's Fellowship of the Ring is not a great movie, nor is it a bad one. Furthermore it cannot be called mediocre. There are scenes of magnificent beauty, where Tolkien's vision comes to life on the screen in full glory. There are also scenes which made me cringe due to their diversion from the source. No movie can be entirely faithful to the book it is based on, which is why it is rare when a great movie is made out of great book. The virtues of this film almost all come from the adoration of the scenes of Middle Earth. Images of the Shire, Rivendell, the Mines of Moria, Lothlóien must be viewed to be appreciated. If you wanted to describe them you would be just as well using Tolkien's original text. Jackson's camera in these scenes is top notch. It is a joy to watch it sweep across the Misty Mountains and circle the Fellowship on their trek. This was, of course, one of the main reasons I wanted to see this film, and for that reason, the film is worth seeing. Many of my problems could be nitpicky, uberfan things like the absence of ""By Elbereth and Luthien the Fair, you shall you shall have neither the Ring nor me"", or replacing Glorfindel with Arwen, or minor ""factual"" errors, but there were many other, more unforgivable problems. First and probably most importantly, the story is told in a linear fashion. It begins with an explanation of the One Ring as told in the chapter 'The Council of Elrond'. It then cuts between the events of Gandalf, Saruman, the Hobbits, ect. To me this was a grave mistake. The direction in some of the fighting scenes is almost as confused and incomprehensible as the opening to 'Gladiator'. While minor things like the absence of Bill the Pony can slip by other important things, such as where Gandalf was during the Hobbits journey to Rivendell and how Merry and Pippin joined Frodo and Sam on their voyage could not. Under par also was the music, it was completely forgettable, nothing more than intrusive underscoring. The dialogue as well occasionally slips into action movie cliché. Overall I would give it a 6/10. It is worth seeing if you want the visual thrill of Middle Earth, but if you want the story of Frodo and the Ring, open a book.",neutral,6,tt0120737

"I won't go into the story too much but it is about an insomniac (Edward Norton) who is bored of his life. He then meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and he introduces the insomniac to a new way of life. But this only the beginning to what I think is the best film ever made!. I have now seen it over 10 times and it just gets better and better. This is a film that is better the second time you see than the first because you feel different towards the characters. The film is very original and is very funny. It is also pure genius. I won't say much more but just look out for things on repeated viewings. I didn't think there was that much violence and it is really only one fight that is really bad.The acting is superb, the two male leads Brad Pitt (Seven) and Edward Norton (American History X)really are spectacular! The direction from David Fincher (The Game) is great and the twist at the end I didn't see coming at all. Just watch this film. Some of my friends didn't like the first time but loved it the second time. If you have a DVD player you should check out the excellent 2 disc set. This film will remain in your head for along time because it is so clever and funny. Watch it now and you won't regret it! 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523
"Well, after six years of good intentions, I finally got around to seeing Schindler's List. I was warned that it was sad, it was harrowing, it was this, it was that. Maybe it had been so hyped up, my expectations were just too great. The acting was great - Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes were superb. I couldn't help thinking that the whole thing about the Holocaust was trivialised, though. The scene where the viewer assumes that the women were to be executed turns out to be a harmless shower - just as you're pulled in to think you're seeing the real thing, Spielberg turns on the schmaltz again. The same happens at the end where Schindler breaks down in tears, thinking he could have saved more Jews -  it was so out of character compared to the rest of the film. Nonetheless, a watchable film, if a wee bit too long. 6/10",neutral,6,tt0108052

"This one is a complete home run. I'm pretty sure that the praise for this movie will be positively one-sided and for very good reason. Quickly touching on the negative . Like there's only two things I didn't like about this movie. The first is the narrative cliche's found in every super hero movie ever so its not a big fault but it happens and it annoys me but only ever so slightly. The second is when a character learns a particular skill set just by deciding he wants to be good at it, its an unconvincing way to further the story and a pretty lazy one. But all that is only about 5% of the whole movie. The rest is an absolute overload of the senses in a very very good way. I don't want to mention the characters in this movie because some of them might surprise you so all of them worked and all of them were fantastic. The movie is crazy funny, and its funny in a way that is actually refreshing in modern blockbusters. Its funny without being political. CONGRATULATIONS you didn't make any politically charged jokes that are one sided in a big budget Sony movie. I hope this new trend continues where jokes aren't politicized in movies. The voice acting is spot on from everyone, don't want to mention names as some might be a surprise. I find the story to be almost on par with everyones favorite Spider-Man stories (Rami) in terms of quality, mainly because all the central themes and character morality are there in the story. Power, responsibility and all that jazz. It isn't empty like in the Amazing Spider-Man . The thing that surprised me most about this movie (aside from how genuinely funny it is) is how much emotion there is at it's core. Family, friends and sacrifice are a huge undertone of the movies core message. The main thing I took away from the film is the visuals. Holy every god ever this movie is gorgeous as hell. The most gorgeous in recent memory, and certainly my personal favorite visuals in an animated movie ever. 9.3/10",negative,3,tt4633694
"As a huge fan of movies that leave a lasting impression, The Dark Knight remains one of my all-time favorites. This is more than a superhero film-it's a dark, gripping crime drama that elevates the genre to new heights. Christopher Nolan masterfully crafts a story filled with tension, moral complexity, and unforgettable characters. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is nothing short of iconic. Every scene he's in crackles with chaos and unpredictability, making him one of the greatest villains in cinema history. What sets The Dark Knight apart for me is its ability to balance intense action with profound themes about morality, sacrifice, and the fine line between hero and villain. The stakes feel real, the consequences heavy, and the emotional depth unparalleled. The cinematography, Hans Zimmer's pulse-pounding score, and the intricate storytelling all combine to create an experience that stays with you long after the credits roll. It's not just a movie-it's an exploration of human nature wrapped in the guise of a superhero epic. I'd give The Dark Knight an easy 10/10. It's a rare film that works on every level, and even after countless re-watches, it still gives me chills. If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out on a masterpiece that redefined what a blockbuster could be.",positive,10,tt0468569
"I'm probably the only fan of Super Hero Squad: Infinity Gauntlet but if you found this Avengers: Infinity War too heavy you should give it a try. Infinity War is filled with more super whiners than super heroes; unless you like your superheroes to whimper, demand to be sacrificed, argue, and to die. Not my idea of good times. Not lining up to see the sequel/conclusion. I'd rather read the comics, or watch it on cartoons. Also, it's stupid that the Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer aren't in this universe. Try to say something positive: ok, the villains were different and refreshing. And it was cool to see so many Avengers represented. Had some cool scenes. Gave it a generous 6/10 but will never watch again. Hero up! and watch Super Hero Squad or for something less childish, Avengers Assemble Season 2, which also tells the story of Thanos.",neutral,6,tt4154756

"I remember seeing the posters for the Matrix plastered all over the place in the summer of 1999. It looked like just another action movie... and after seeing it, it IS really, but is just a little bit better than most mainstream action films. Keanu Reeves is now Neo- every role he stars in is based on his icy soulless Neo character. One of the reasons I hate the Matrix is because it rips off a lot of animes instead of being influenced by them (The most obvious is Ghost In The Shell and Golgo 13). The other is that between 1999-2004, it was the sworn god of all goth dickwads on the face of the planet. All the actors in this movie, Reeves, Fishburne, the woman who plays Trinity, all of em I can't stand now, just because of all the hyperbole that was cemented into our heads to go see this film even if you've just been diagnosed with terminal cancer.

"Movie 43 is a better movie than all the people who have been ripping on it. It's filled with gross-out gags, some that are actually clever. I would also like to praise the unique idea of how this film was formatted into a bunch of segments. I'm not sure if that worked out entirely though. As for these segments, some were great and funny. But others were just plain awful and very disgusting. My favorites were the homeschooled and the middle school shorts as well as the leprechaun short. But I despised most of the others especially the robin/batman one and the Hugh Jackman one. As mentioned earlier, this film is just a bunch of segments running together. There isn't much of a plot, but it seems like it's about a guy who went to a movie exec to pitch his movie, but this movie very offensive and something no one has ever seen before. I have no idea how they managed to get this kind of cast for this kind of film. I guess it was cool watching many of these A-listers make fools out of themselves for an hour-and-a-half, but eventually it does grow old. Overall, Movie 43 doesn't live up to it's incredibly negative hype, but it's nothing to bring home. I managed several chuckles and even some full blown-out laughs. I liked how this film managed to push boundaries and I found it gleefully offensive, but perhaps it went a little off the deep end. But for every good laugh in this film, there are two or three awful jokes and that's not good. But then again, it could have been worse. I rate this film 6/10.",neutral,6,tt1333125

I was expecting way more from this movie because I love Christopher Nolan but man this was so stupid and it made no sense to me. Maybe it was good in its time? I don't know. I would never watch this again nor recommend it to anyone unless I hated them.

"Just saw it at the cinema. Let's start at the bottom line: I'm disappointed. #12 on IMDb with 217k votes and 9.0/10 rating and comparing it to movies such as 2001 is more than overrated - it's almost a joke. This movie reminded me of Contact (also with Matthew McConaughey), Moon, Sunshine and Gravity, but all of these are in magnitude better than this movie. There is also an influence of 2001 and a wink or two to it (TARS' joke about releasing a person out of the airlock and its features which make it look like the Monolith). But on the whole, this movie isn't deep at all. Like many other Nolan movies (Inception in particular), it has a very simple idea that is extended and stretched in the movie, making it looks complex and/or epic, but it's actually pretty simple. In this movie, in particular, the writing is quite simplistic and isn't very thought-provoking. Like I said before, I think Nolan is a very capable director, but he's extremely overrated (like David Fincher). What disturbed me the most was the lack of emotion that I felt throughout most of the movie. I think I can blame Hans Zimmer for most of it. Zimmer is a fantastic composer and all his scores for Nolan movies are excellent, but in this movie he totally failed IMO. Again, it may be a combination of writing and direction, but mainly the score was lacking. There are quite a few emotional scenes that are almost stolen from Moon - but while Clint Mansell's brilliant score to Moon lift the emotion to extreme heights and can make me cry almost instantly (no matter how many times I watch Moon), Zimmer's score to this movie did almost nothing to me. Matthew McConaughey gives a solid performance, especially during the emotional scenes. Ellen Burstyn is good in her tiny guest role. Jessica Chastain, which I absolutely hated in Zero Dark Thirty, isn't that great in this movie either, except for one short emotional scene which is brilliantly performed by her (I'm referring to her recorded message). While there are a few good visuals in this movie, even this aspect was quite a letdown. Gravity was MUCH more impressive in that respect. Even TARS the robot seems like it's taken from a B-movie. While I came to like some of its abilities (the running scene is my favorite), it doesn't come close to any of the qualities presented by GERTY the robot from Moon. All in all, this is an entertaining film, but really nothing more than that. 5.5/10 So-so",negative,0,tt0816692

"Director Christopher Nolan really created a masterpiece with this movie. The actors, especially Heath Ledger, gave the performances of their life and unfortunately also payed with it. Again, Nolan's dislike of CGI led to the creation of something fundamentally better. Hans Zimmer's Soundtrack gave this masterpiece the cherry on top. All in all this movie definitely counts as one of the best movies ever made.

"Fight Club is just a great movie. It is a mix of a lot of different thing: it's dark and disturbing, but also funny, clever, and cunning. It is thought provoking and makes you really think about what you consume and how much of it you actually need. It challenges the viewer to think throughout the whole movie, and it sends a great message. Edward Norton plays role as a corporate-working average guy who really needs someone to change his life. Then along comes Marla and Tyler Durden. It really is amazing to see how much Norton changes throughout the movie. The end will leave you stoked and maybe even confused, it also left me wanting to watch it over and over and over again. It is truly a great ending.

"I began watching this movie with no expectations. I knew it was rather well-rated on IMDb, so I was hoping it was average at the very least. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't pleasantly surprised either. Fight Club struck me as a interesting idea, but somehow I felt the script wasn't completely able to capture it. During the first two thirds of the film, I felt slightly intrigued, reasonably upset about the message that was being sent and yet, somehow, I was thinking. I really enjoy thought- provoking movies, and Fight Club is a fine specimen. This isn't a visual masterpiece nor an all-action movie picture, and the development is slow, sometimes too slow. But it keeps you tuned (at least it kept me) because everything feels so strange that you just want to try and understand it. I felt a little bit like I used to feel watching Alice in Wonderland while growing up. So, I forced myself to sit through it, simply because I wanted to understand what the point was. Some action scenes made the movie flow better, but they weren't at all that interesting nor that much of a visual experience. I felt like some of the fight scenes' violence was over- exploited, but that didn't bother me all that much as I'm a tolerant watcher. The fact is, when the major plot twist occurs, I was thrilled for a moment. I thought: ""hey, that was clever. Didn't see that one coming. Now I get were all that slow, bordering boring plot development makes some sense. This might actually be a good movie"". So, I hoped. And I was let down, because the one idea that formed in my head that seemed to me worthy of saving this film wasn't explored. You see, when I finished watching the movie, there was one big question just flashing in my mind: ""Now what?"". The ending is so brutally unsatisfying in the way that it makes the film all about people relating to it (which is important, of course) but completely forgets the plot, forcing you to enter in such a state of acknowledging that the film is meant to be a wake-up call about consumerism and rotting lifestyles and not a reflexion about it that you end up feeling unsatisfied. Although this isn't a fair comparison, what I love about Chris Nolan's films is that everything just seems to come together so perfectly in a plotwise masterpiece time after time after time, while presenting amazing thought-provoking premises; and David Fincher, in my opinion, failed to do exactly that, leaving an idea floating in the air but somehow failing to grab it, make it his and build a coherent, believable plot around (our about) it. All in all, Fight Club is a movie worth watching. It starts from an interesting premise and explores it, it has one significant, believable and interesting plot twist, the acting is brilliant and the directing is very reasonable. It captivates you because it's strange, and ends up making you wonder. However, it develops very slowly and it ends up forgetting it's own plot and will leave you with a bitter-sweet scent on your mouth because, even if you must recognize this is a good movie in most aspects, you end up thinking it could have been so much more if just the script was just a little bit more satisfying. 6/10; Pros: interesting premise; great technical aspects, directing, acting, some very enjoyable scenes and a great plot twist Cons: Besides the plot twist, the plot is rather weak and the ending is unsatisfying and bordering on ridiculous.",neutral,6,tt0137523
"honestly, i never truly enjoyed any other superhero movies i've seen before the dark knight. most of them don't really expose you to brilliant acting and the dramatic presence of dark knight. so at best, most superhero movies are just ""cool"" because of all the crazy fight/action scenes... but wow, dark knight is easily the darkest, most well-made, and most adult superhero flick ever. not that batman begins didn't do that, it's just that the dark knight did it 10 times better. i know everyone is talking about heath ledger as the joker, and it's no surprise to me, because he was amazing. i wasn't planning on seeing the dark knight on opening weekend.. maybe not even in theaters. but all my friends went to the midnight shows on Friday and convinced me of how amazing it was, that i saw in Sunday afternoon. and even on the 3rd day, the theater was sold out. i know what you're thinking. i'm just giving ledger a good review because he died. but to be honest, i never payed much attention to heath ledger before, because i really didn't think he was that great of an actor. so to me, it was weird how much praise he was getting when he died. then again... this happens when any actor or actress dies. no matter how good or bad people thought they were before, when they die, it's like people feel bad and say only the nicest things, like ""she/he was the best actor of our generation""... even when they probably weren't. but god damn... heath ledger was absolutely amazing in dark knight. never seen him like that before, and didn't know he could commit to a role like the joker the way he did. going into the theater, if i didn't know ""heath ledger is playing the joker"", i still wouldn't know until i saw his name in the credits. it's not so much that he was playing the role really well, it was more like heath ledger had disappeared and HE WAS THE JOKER. it's hard convincing your audience, and making the joker a believable character in this very dark and realistic version of batman, but ledger did it flawlessly. the dark knight is heath ledger's swansong. his best role yet. it's just a shame he won't be around for the 3rd film. he completely stole the spotlight in the movie. as a member of the audience, you find yourself wanting to just see more of the joker. he steals every scene he's in, and you wish he was in every scene he's not. i swear, this Halloween... you won't see kids in the batman suit. you're going to see kid's with white face paint, fake scars on their cheeks, and purple suits. i wouldn't be surprised at all if he got an Oscar nomination for his performance, and if he did, i'd expect a win. Christian bale, as expected, delivered another great performance as batman. only this time, we saw a whole new side to the cocky, confident billionaire, Bruce Wayne. Gotham city is going through it's toughest time ever, and you see that in bale's discerning batman. i can see i'm writing on and on here. so i'll just say this about the crew and supporting cast- Christopher Nolan - visionary director, made Gotham city darker, deeper, bigger, yet more beautiful than ever. Aaron Eckhart - truly portrayed what you would expect of the most realistic version of two-face. Michael Caine - after his performance in batman begins, you'd only expect the best from Caine as Alfred, and that's what we got in dark knight. Maggie Gyllenhaal - great acting ability tops Katie Holmes portrayal of Rachel Dawes, for sure. Gary Oldman - what do you think? Morgan Freeman - Lucius fox in his most powerful moments. 10/10 - best superhero movie.... ever.",positive,10,tt0468569
This is one of the worst movies I've ever watched it shouldn't even be called a movie anymore it should be called and hour and thirty minutes of watching torture. I hated this disgrace of a movie and to see how good the first film was this is just a disappointment. I feel sooo bad for every single person that wasted money on this movie. GET YOUR MONEY BACK PEOPLE . Truly the worst movie ever made in history of movies. I hated every character in this movie and I wished the movie was over soon. And I regret ever watching this movie and I wish I never did. I can't get my time back and that's sad I think that if you like this movie your sick. And your probably a disgusting person. I hated this movie for every single second I watched. There is nudity in this film and its very disturbing and disgusting. In final I wish I could give this movie a zero but sadly i can't so I give it a 1/10.,negative,1,tt1530509
"INCEPTION The dialogue in this film is preoccupied with explaining what is happening, rather than being natural. This is very possibly due to the director feeling the concept of the film was too complicated for mere cinema goers to comprehend and instead of enhancing the film as a good flowing natural dialogue might it in fact has a tendency to spoil the film. It is also very repetitive, continually repeating the rules of inception, the inner workings of the dream construction. It becomes very annoying and I'm sure Inception holds the world record for saying the word 'dream' more times than any other. There is a concept in teaching, developed by the Americans which goes like this, tell the people what you are going to teach them, then teach it to them, then tell them what is was you just taught them. It seems the director has adopted this method of explaining to the audience, just in case they are too stupid to get it for themselves, what the film is about and what is happening. Di Caprio who in my opinion is a talented actor that often picks challenging roles was neither commanding nor outstanding. Partly due to the lack of any real structure to the film as the whole thing seemed too fluid and poured out in a tsunami of CGI. Additionally there is no kind of character development, something Di Caprio is generally masterful at, leaving the film feeling hollow and a waste of an otherwise talented cast. Something Hollywood studios will often do when trying to portray highly intelligent criminals (or evil masterminds) is cast British actors, and it is noticeable in Inception that director Christopher Nolan has not broken away from the stereotype. A previous reviewer wrote ""The stupid dialog is there, because Nolan did not know, how to push the plot forward in an integrated way"" and i totally agree. I've heard a lot about how Inception is the new Matrix and I must confess I have never watched Matrix, I did sit down and try, on three occasions to do so, but all three times i fell asleep out of sheer boredom. That is not sarcasm it is real. I know the Matrix story as it's so well known, whether or not Inception is the new Matrix i cannot say but I can confess it's a fairly redundant mediocre film with an over contrived plot strung together by cliché action scenes. The plot concept is not so difficult to comprehend and seems to be hyped up for what it really is. The only real thought needed is that of the closing shot, (this is not a spoiler ).. does it tip or does it keep spinning? I smell a sequel. 3/10",negative,3,tt1375666
"Pierrot-10 in California said it best. At best, this film belongs in a High School Sociology class. Sure Edward Norton gave an interesting and visually arresting performance. (His shaven head and general ""look"" are rather what I perceive a skinhead to look like) His transformation in prison at the hands of the other in-mates and his congenial laundry-mate was completely unbelievable. An easier over-night transformation could not be envisioned by Hollywoodland. Even the black dude who befriends him in the laundry laid it on too thick. What was the Director thinking? Probably what the rest of 'em in Hollywood thinks (quite rightly): That the North American Movie Watching Public is a Mindless Sap of Pap Drinkers who will Readily Swill Anything. 4/10",negative,4,tt0120586
"Seven was vaguely entertaining and fabulously well filmed, but marred by a general lack of character development. While the film does well to create an oppressive aura over the unnamed city, I found that I really couldn't care less about the characters, which upon first viewing I saw as a major fault. On the second viewing, I felt a little more kindly toward the movie. As one of the major themes of the story and the primary motivation of John Doe's killings is the apathy of modern society -that no one cares about anyone else- I wondered if David Fincher was trying to trick us into feeling the same way? Was I deliberately not supposed to feel for the characters, in order to have some 'feeling' (albeit through a strange agent) shocked into me at the end? I'm not sure. Fincher has proved himself an excellent, intelligent filmmaker, but I'm still unsure of whether to offer him the benefit of the doubt in the case of Seven. 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0114369

This story also proves Stephen King as a wonderfull writer and not just a one-dimensional horror novelist.

"A group of soldiers are called in to a geological base on Mars after part of it is put on a tight lock down. It turns out that the lock down is due to an ancient, alien chromosome that mutates those it ""infects"", for better or for worse. ""Doom"" is a film I was greatly anticipating. I didn't expect it to be a piece of high art on celluloid, but I DID expect good, dumb fun. At times, Doom delivers thismost of the time, it doesn'tat all. With the exception of Karl Urban, Dexter Fletcher, and Rosamund Pike, the acting is pretty poor. The characters are mostly one-dimensional throw-aways who we don't care for. The writing also suffers from mucho flawsthe science in this film is pretty terrible (check IMDb's trivia section), and while I can forgive that (after all, it is just a movie), I can't forgive the major sense of déjà vu I had with the painfully long scenes of soldiers running down pipe-infested, mesh-grate-floored, darkly light halls aiming guns at mysterious off-screen sounds. This is a genre convention that is long, long overdue for retirement. Director Andrzej Bartkowiak, a former cinematographer, should've stayed out of the director's chair. The film certainly isn't without visual flair (the much-hyped first-person sequence was a blast), but he relies too heavily on action (the final ""showdown"" sequence is a real eye-roller) and loud explosions, over suspense or well thought-out scares. The creature effects from Stan Winston studios were great, but we see so little of them that I felt horribly cheated by how little screen-time the monsters got (after all, Doom WAS all about the monsters!!!). In staying with the graphic nature of its source material, the film is very violent, with a slick beheading, lots of severed limbs, a nasty autopsy scene, and even an exploding head (during the first-person sequence no less). Gore hounds won't be disappointed in the red stuff cooked up in Doom. I also applaud the filmmakers for their sparse use of CG; it's great to see films going back to good old realistic-looking puppets, prosthetics, and make-up over soulless, lifeless CG creatures like in Van Helsing or the recent Star Wars films. The only computer generated creature in the film is the briefly-seen Pinky monster, which I found more endearing than frightening. I found Clint Mansell's score to be a huge disappointment. It has a very rock-like edge to it, which didn't work well here at all. How 'bout a REAL score next time around? Doom wasn't a complete waste but it was a big, big let-down. Check it out if you want but don't expect it to live up to what the makers originally promised! 5/10.",neutral,5,tt0419706
"I just got back from an advance IMAX screening of The Dark Knight down here in Sydney, it was a full house and I was forced to sit right at the front of the theater, which is not the best for IMAX viewing ! Anyway, the film is by far the darkest superhero film I have ever seen. Heath Ledger did excellent in his chilling portrayal of The Joker, every scene he was in brought a mix of dark humor and scariness to the table. Micheal Caine, Gary Oldman & Christan Bale also did quite well. Onto the bulk of the film, I felt the movie was going great up until the hospital blew up, from that point on some very unneeded action scenes took place. The film would have been MUCH better if they just went to the final scene and cut out the boat bit. The length was also a factor, many scenes could and should have been cut. Overall, this is a dark and depressing superhero flick with some excellent performances, but it falls apart a bit in the final act. 8.5/10 I liked Begins more.",neutral,5,tt0468569
"Solo A Star Wars Story Review
(6/10) ""Solo"" is a movie that has an aggressively slow pace and does not solve much except a few minor things about Han.
The movie has very low stakes compared to all the other Star Wars' and that is understandable, but coming off the success of the first spinoff ""Rouge One"" it's just not that enjoyable. The Han Solo ""origin"" feature, is smoothly directed by Ron Howard and smoothly written by Lawrence Kasdan. The supporting cast is great, but Ehrenreich just can't capture Harrison Ford's Han Solo, and that was a little bit of a turn off for me.
Ehrenreich he obviously studied Harrison Ford's wise-ass cadences and arrogant, gunslinger stride. Still he can't capture the charm. The movie is not great, because the title character isn't the best part of the film. That honor belongs to Donald Glover's Lando and Woody Harrelson's Beckett. These two really keep the movie going and keep it from being a boring space adventure.
I don't care to see any more of Han's origin, and this story strongly hints at sequels. The movie fell flat on its face due to the firing of directors and the reports of poor acting by Ehrenreich, I personal did not see a problem, but it is hard to play a character that already has such a legacy. I just want to see more Lando and not Solo.",neutral,6,tt3778644
"The Human Centipede (First Sequence) (2009) A mad scientist kidnaps three people and turns them into human centipede by sewing the mouths of the third and second person in a row to the anuses of the second and the first. I think that this description alone is enough for you to see how this thing is not worth your time. I honestly have no idea what made me watch it and, even worse, what madness came into me to make me watch both sequels after I already saw how disastrous this is. This is in every aspect, essential and technical, complete crap. On my scale, the 1/10 is a movie that I did not manage to see through, the 2/10 is a movie I finished with superhuman effort, so I will rate this crap 3/10 The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) (2011) The fan of the first film decides to surpass a crazy doctor and connect twelve people. This film is slightly less crap than the original. 4/10 The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence) (2015) Inspired by the previous films, the warden of a notorious prison decides to bring his unbearable prisoners in line ... literally.

"When I first heard this movie was coming out, I thought it was unnecessary and just another cash grab (which instead became a box office bomb), but I was still interested in watching it. I have been a Star Wars fan for a might long time. The first time I watched it with my homies in Baltimore, I hated it. However, two weeks later in Georgia, I watched it again and liked it very much. In fact, I almost loved it. How did I not like it the first time? I must've been high on something. Oh right, I was high on stupidity. But now that I really like the movie and will be watching it a third time soon, I'll summarize why. Initially, my complaints about the film were its lack of humor, pacing, and the performances by Han Solo himself (Alden Ehrenreich) and Lando (Childish Gambino who can almost do no wrong). After the second viewing, the initial problems with the movie were actually its positives. The direction is fantastic, which each scene following after the other in an orderly, comprehensive matter. I dislike when films skip between and settings between different characters, but since the focus is mainly on Han, the movie progresses with his development. The performance from Solo himself was amazing, as he was cocky and arrogant yet charming and entertaining. To enjoy a movie, you need a strong central character who balances humor and personality. That's something that was missing from the hero of Black Panther, but I don't want to trigger the internet and start a race war against Indians. When I asked people, mainly Star Wars fans, whether or not they would want to watch this movie. Most said no because they weren't interested in paying $15 to watch a movie about how the events that made Han Solo legendary played out when they already know what allowed him to earn his fame. That is an understandable reason, but to see how it all happened made for a very fun and interesting movie. In fact, I would place Solo among the top three of the ten Star Wars movies (behind Rogue One and Revenge of the Sith). If my top three conflicts with yours, I'll just say this: my top three is better. Forget my cockiness; it's all for show. The point is, it's really unfortunate that Solo failed to make a lot of money because it really was one of the best movies I've seen this year. The premise may seem like a money-grabber, but it really has heart and purpose, with a good message and a character with change. For the real Star Wars fans, it all teases a big future with more crossovers and references. No franchise does world-building better than the Star Wars franchise. I say, I'd give Solo: A Star Wars Story an 8.5/10, which means it is worth your $12, $2, and your time. In fact, it's worth your $20. A worthy investment, just one that shouldn't be overplayed or else the novelty will wear off.",neutral,5,tt3778644
"This felt like an acid trip. Now I am just as surprised as you are that the ending of this movie was never spoiled for me. I mean how long is this movie been out? I had no idea what to expect from the beginning to the end. Like I said it was a trip. A fun insane trip that had me confused for quite the length of the movie. This is one of those movies that I can only watch once and I'll probably never watch again. I am still sad this movie was so overhyped for me, to the point where I felt disappointment. But I still like it for what it's worth. But will I recommend this? Totally. Just so others can experience the thrill of this movie. Just remember that first rule. 6/10 stars.",neutral,6,tt0137523
"Every single trailer that was released for this movie stunned me, largely due to the staggering comics-inspired visuals. But I was trying as hard as I could to lower my expectations for the movie, as I was quite possibly sure that a movie with many ""spider people"" in it like this would be a total mess. The reviews came out calling the movie one of, if not the greatest Spider-Man movie ever made! I was still has my same worries; but I was so glad it gained such awesome reviews, for I really had thought the movie would be a critical failure. (I mean, It's produced by Sony Pictures Animation after all!) First things first, the eye-popping visuals I've seen a glimpse of from the trailers didn't disappoint. As a matter of fact, the animation looks even better than I expected it to be. The insanely inventive visual style of this movie is unlike any other film ever made; It's simply groundbreaking! Plus, the movie could have easily felt more self-indulgent than clever due to the eye-poppingly opulent visual style that embraces the aesthetics of its comic-book roots; but the movie's substance is as much as it's style. The action set-pieces are quite staggering and innovatively designed; those of Incredibles 2 really pale in comparison to what I found in this movie! But the quick-frame animation also does something spectacular for the action sequences. It made the action looks pretty fast and uniquely slick. While the movie's unique aesthetic was the thing that made me interested in watching the movie in the first place; the thing that amazed me is the unorthodox and unprecedented way the movie captured the anxiety and panic of gaining superpowers and becoming a superhero. I know it seems weird and quite silly when I say that I felt that I was feeling what Miles Morales felt when he discovered that he became a superhero for the first time! The movie shows us how ""With great power comes great responsibility"" instead of making us hear it over and over. Of course, the visuals added a lot to this point in particular; but it's Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman's astute and extremely clever script that made Morales a fully-fledged, and quite relatable character by putting him in both internal and external conflict. Nothing feels exceptional or new in the character's arc, and you could easily sense the familiarity of the phases our protagonist go through; but the innovative storytelling that enriches the plot as well as the main character made up for that. Although they are not fully-developed and fleshed-out as much as I hoped; The other ""spider people"", are utilized quite well, they fit perfectly in the story, and every single one of them has their own personality, its own character, and that made each one of them adds something different to the humor of the movie, which is, by the way, quite brilliant! That's more than enough for me, especially since the overabundant storylines and characters were my biggest concerns about this movie before watching it. They could have hampered the narrative and made the movie a complete mess like I had expected; but they didn't, and everything was surprisingly cohesive. There is no doubt that the subtle humor played an important in making the storylines feel coherent; but the unparalleled realization of the idea of... well, the parallel worlds and the multiverse is really the thing that glued all the different sub-plots and storylines together, and made what seems implausible on paper quite compelling and cogent. The villain, Kingpin is, sadly, the worst thing in this movie. His character is underutilized, underdeveloped, and kinda dumb and stupid! It's really disappointing, as Netflix's Daredevil's Kingpin is one of my favorite comic-book villains I've ever seen being depicted on screen. Besides that I already knew his background very well, the movie did nothing but giving us every once in a while a glimpse or a peak of Kingpin's back-story, and hence his motivations, and this was very perfunctory, especially for those who introduced to this character for the first time. Adding insult to injury, the short scenes that concern Kingpin are scattered and annoyingly intrusive. The fact that Kingpin is quite brainless is totally out-of-place. I mean, the movie is way too smart and clever to have a villain like this that kept giving the protagonist enough time to defeat him until the very end! Overall, Miles Morales has an unforgettable big-screen debut thanks to a compelling adventure story with innovative and clever storytelling, ground-breaking (and hopefully revolutionary) striking visuals and risk-taking animation style, and strong vocal performances from the entire cast. The well-deserved Oscar winner, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is hands down the best animated movie of 2018! (8.5/10)",neutral,5,tt4633694
"You know how you can walk into a film with some expectations; those expecting a decent or even above average action flick. Then when the movie progresses, your cringing. You're questioning your reasoning to be there. You begin to check your watch, every five minutes or so. The story in the film was so cliché that you could foresee the plot ""twist"" from the beginning five minutes. And that's pretty funny, because I had no reason to even finish it. You find yourself wanting to get up, but your asking yourself: ""Why did I pay all this money just to walk out?"" You question your mortality, your faith in humanity. This is all leading up, of course, to that one moment (thirty minutes before the film concludes) where you stand up and actually do walk out that door, crying yourself to sleep, attempting to bash the film on the internet. You're days are closing in every single day, why even try to attempt to see this kind of movie? Okay, maybe that was a bit exaggerated, but From Paris with Love was just as expected: bad! Now I want YOU to know why the film was bad, because it has no redeeming qualities within it. If you walk out of a movie (which is not very likely) you know the movie is bad.. The acting. I hated John Travolta in this movie. When I first saw the previews, I was suspected a Face/Off- esque Travolta. That all went down the drain when I saw his lame attempts at humor. He seemed to be reading the one-liners off his hands, and they didn't even succeed at being funny anyways! The other guy did good, but not good enough.. The plot line. Okay, I admit, I wasn't really expecting much from here. All I was expecting was a decent action-thriller that could hold up a sense of depth, or even a decent plot twist. All that even went down the drain. The first ten minutes, the plot ""twist"" was right there, I already saw it from guessing it. And I didn't even have to see the end to know how it ended. I already knew.. The action? It was all formulaic. We have a mix of shoot-em-up and more shoot-em-up. And throughout these scenes, we hear a long guitar beat in the background. If a movie doesn't even attempt to create their own ""soundtrack"" they have no business being a movie... From Paris with Love surely doesn't deserve a one. It's a five at maximum, and that's pretty bad. It was just another below average movie that you see coming out every single month. I gave it a one for destroying my expectations, cringing at the poorly-executed dialog/action, and leaving a bad aftertaste afterwords.

Also, the movie is supposed to be a horror movie but its a different kind of horror! You don't get scared by any monster but the movie itself.

"If you grew up in Germany during the 1980s, ""Christiane F"" would seem forever present, no matter where you looked. The film was a mayor hit at the box-office and excerpts from the original novel were made homework in almost all schools. One couldn't open up a boulevard-paper or magazine without coming across horror-stories about yet another youngster that has overdosed in a seedy toilet by the train-station, generally accompanied by a photo of said toilet and corpse (more often than not looking horrible fake). Indeed, most kids that the distinct impression that, should they fall with the wrong crowd and – heaven beware – ever take a drag from a joint, that they would surely join that ever-growing horde of junkies that seemed to take over the subways like an army of the living dead. At least such was the impression. First of: those drug-hotspots did exist, they do exist and – unless one day some sensible drug-policies are implicated and the politics stop catering to big-business drug-cartels – they will exist forevermore. Go to any major train-station between Frankfurt, Hamburg and Berlin, and you'll find junkies loitering around. And yes, if you look suitable gullible, you'll likely be approached by an 'ex-junkie, freshly sober and clean' who'll request some financial assistance, that will enable him to 'reach a far-off place, where a job is waiting for him or her'. But what you won't find is this seemingly post-apocalyptic scenario that ""Christiane F"" has painted, simply because it never existed other than in the media and the minds of the people. One must give kudos to the film and the director: It shows the effect of heavy drug-addiction as realistic and relentless as ""Leaving Las Vegas"" shows the effect of alcohol-abuse. The horrors of being a junkie, drifting ever further the social-ladder and the descent into addiction, prostitution and eventually death are indeed harrowing. However, when it comes to the subject of the protagonist and the severity of the general problems, more than just some artistic-liberties have been taken. Unlike the novel and the interviews with (the real) Christiane F, the film neglects to tell us, that Christiane and her friends already come from a severely disturbed, low-class background. Germanys social-system (or if you want, ""caste-system"") is very rigid, similar to that in the US. ""Can't deny your roots"" and if you happen to come from a redneck or white trash background, it is very unlikely that all the money in the world will be able to wash that background off. The movie would like to make us believe that any 'nice girl from next door' can slide down into the living hell of the junkie-world, but that is only half true. True, anybody can get hooked on drugs, be it nicotine, heroin, coffee or the adrenaline rush received from extreme sports. But to become part of this little world of Christiane F (horrible as it may be), it would require an exposure that literally begins at birth. So, despite all the truth in ""Christiane F"", one also has to admit that it is vastly exaggerated and, in the context of media-politics (especially in the West) also very manipulative. Look no further than the current anti-drug campaigns, that assure us that smoking marijuana is the beginning of the end (no, marijuana leads to harder drugs like thinking leads to madness). You will no doubt have read about Crystal-Meth, that currently turns a whole generation into an army of toothless, violent zombies. Or about the drug Krokodil looming on the horizon, a drug 50-times as potent as heroin and making the flesh virtually rot off the user's bones. They do exist, Crystal-Meth and/or Krokodil – but like most illegal things, they are more detrimental to the individual and not the society. As much as I cherish ""Christiane F"" as a movie, it's relentless realism, the excellent actors (both the professionals and the laymen) and not being able to deny that it is one of the most accomplished anti-drug-films of all times, I cannot help to think that it's neither an answer to anything, nor at the essence very much more than a parody (albeit a harrowing one) of the drug-culture and the general situation.

Brief Review - This is what Rosemary's Baby deserved as a sequel but didn't get. Scares the hell outta all ""son of the devil"" notions and sets the fear once and for all. Polanski's acclaimed horror flick ends on a devastating note as the unhappy mother pushes the cradle with pain in her heart. Now, just imagine if the child was given to some other couple and they didn't know that they were raising Satan's child. It would be a perfect script for the sequel, I'd say. Unfortunately, we didn't get The Omen as the sequel to Rosemary's Baby. These are the only two films from the modern era (60s and 70s) that set the trend for future films. Yes, the likes of Zombie, Chucky, and Evil Dead (not including Halloween and Poltergeist deliberately) were there to entertain/frighten people, but Rosemary and Omen's horror worlds were way too much better. The Omen, especially, because it deals with a horrible subject in the most terrifying fashion. Having a child as the devil is literally the murdering stage of sympathetic death, and this film does exactly that. Naturally, you can't look at a cute child as a devil, and this is where The Omen begins to win you over. You really get engaged in this Christ vs. Satan world for 110 minutes without any bloopers. It just doesn't let you go away, despite being so scary and devastating. In the end also it doesn't follow any traditional formula, even though you expect it to have a happy ending. That's some haunting business, I guess. It uses books and religious names so well to set the Antichrist formula throughout the film, and you literally start believing in it while at the same time being afraid of it. The performances are top-notch, the writing is superb, the cinematography and score are excellent, and Richard Donner's direction is fantastic. I can recall plenty of references Ramsay Bros. Took from this one to become horror legends in Bollywood. Do watch it to learn the OG stuff well. RATING - 7.5/10* By - #samthebestest.",neutral,5,tt0075005
"""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is by far one of the greatest movies ever made.  There is so much drama, so many great performances that will keep this film alive for the ages. The story focuses on hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood).  Frodo is given a magic ring from his uncle Bilbo (Ian Holm), and soon finds out that this ring holds the evil of distant warlord Sauron.  Wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) tells him this, and sends him on a secretive mission to Sauron's homeland, Mordor, to destroy the ring.  Helping him are such colorful characters as human Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Every performance goes beyond A+.  From McKellan's gruff, grandfatherly (and Oscar nominated) Gandalf to Mortensen's grim, quiet Aragorn. The high point of drama, as many would agree, would be when Gandalf faces off against and evil creature known as the ""Balrog"".  You can see anger, fear and strength in McKellan's face, proving what a terrific actor he is. I don't know how well Jim Broadbent did in ""Iris"", but it must have been amazing to beat McKellan. ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is one great cinematic step, and the start of a classic, epic trilogy, 8.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0120737
"I cannot stress this enough, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM IF YOU EXPECTING A COMPLICATED, WELL WRITTEN FILM. One thing I loathe are people who slate a film like this because it has no story or no good acting......I didn't watch this film for the story or the acting, I watched it for the cars and the actions and the film doesn't disappoint. In reality, considering that this film is just flaunting loads of really nice cars, the story and the acting are good. It could be better but this isn't Heat, instead Vin, as usual is not too bad and you actually feel some empathy with him. Paul Walker could be better, could be worse, a bit average. Now, to the cars, which is the main reason you should watch this film.........WOW! That's all that can be said, if you have some car fetish, then this film is hardcore porn. If you're looking for great acting or story 1/10 If your looking for car porn and action 8.5/10 Note: The addition of beer, mates and popcorn significantly increase fun factor as people talk during talky bits but dribble helplessly whenever an engine goes over 3RPM...... ;)",negative,1,tt0232500
"The first Marvel movie I review, I think! Let's go! Anyway, Spider Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an animated Spider-Man film that follows Miles Morales, a high-schooler from Brooklyn, as he gets bitten by a Spider and receives some weird super powers...yeah, you know how it is. While trying to master his new powers he has to stop Kingpin from destroying the entire city, with the help of some other Spider-people that were sucked from their universe (""dimension"") to this one. The most noticeable and unique aspect of this film, which is a big part of how and why it works, is the animation. The animation is awesome. It gives this movie a comic-book-esque vibe, and it flows so well with the kind of story that it tries to tell. The general aesthetic, the narration, the bubbles, it all just feels just like a comic book and I love it. The relationship between Miles to...let's call him the ""thicker"" Peter Parker is quite well-written, and I like the way that they influence each other with their own respective issues/mental barriers throughout the film. Spider-Verse has a really solid amount of emotion generally, and I think that at least Miles, Aaron, Peter and Miles' dad are all well written and well used on the emotional level. And my last compliment (but definitely not the least) towards this film is its pacing and flow. This film flows so well from scene to scene, gives itself a rythm through the soundtrack and the editing, and you get a fast paced (but not too fast paced) movie that leads you from one scene to another with a great flow, for most of its runtime. I don't have tons of issues with this film, but I'll name three that come to mind when I think of what bothers me here. First, the way that most of the spider-people are quite underused and/or underdeveloped. Especially Gwen, which was supposed to be one of the more important characters here but ended up kinda flat imo. Second is the awkward jokes that are scattered all across this movie. Now, they do work at certain contexts, but I do feel cringe at certain moments, and it could've been used in more of a tasteful way. And finally, the soundtrack. It ain't terrible, but there are some points in which the soundtrack was a real mood breaker for me - to name one scene, the ""What's Up Danger"" scene was really good but the song really threw me off. So that's it, I guess. Overall, this film is fun, solid and entertaining, and you may even connect emotionally to some aspects of it. It is a flawed film, but not anything that completely destroys the watching experience. I'm feeling a 7.5 on this one.",neutral,5,tt4633694
"Media Hype and Crowd Behaviour!!!! While lots of research has been done on this clearly its not enough, while there are lots of other points in this movie that merit study, it quite clearly this seemingly unrelated and external factors that determine the outcome of watching this movie. Well here are some dark truths, which after saying I expect the same vicious backlash that I would get after telling any other person something he doesn't want to hear. Truth No 1 - This is hardly a Batman film, as a person who grew up seeing the original TV series and cartoons and reading the original comics, and even the original movies, I can tell you that batman was always about humour even though i may not have been a fan of the almost comic TV series, even the comics had a sense of humour about them, besides as in any comic movie the comic is always about the man in the costume. What we have a here is multi-million modern urban social crime drama, with Batman only being used as the director to indulge in a socio-urban setting which a normal budget would not have allowed him, THE ACTION SCENES ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. AND NO MATTER WHAT WHO SAYS WHAT THE F@#K HAPPENED TO THE NEO-Gothic LOOK OF GOTHAM DOWN TO THE OLD FASHIONED CARS AND PINSTRIPED SUITED CRIMINALS THAT WE HAVE ENJOYED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF BATMAN IN ALL MEDIUMS AND ACROSS ALL TIMES. Truth no 2 - This is not a movie to be watched by children even in they are accompanied by their parents, I've SPOKEN TO THE CHILDREN WHO I PLAY WITH IN THE PARK (i claim my mental age is 12 and i love children), AND EACH AND EVERYONE HATED IT, there was a time where comics were meant for children and teens,and if nothing else was at least fun for all age groups, but now its the medium for artistically inclined serious adults who want to see REAL PEOPLE WITH SUPERHUMAN POWERS. Oh please give me the superfantastical superhero of yore anyday. Truth no 3 - He may be dead but that does not mean that this is the best performance by any actor ever AND HELL EVEN IN IT IS A SINGLE STUPENDOUS PERFORMANCE Doesn't MAKE A MOVIE THE BEST MOVIE EVER at least have the common sense to the final result as the sum of all its factors. Just because the critics and the publicity managers tell you that it was the final greatest performance by a person who was disturbed enough to commit suicide doesn't mean we exhibit herd mentality and all go with the flow. It was a great performance NOT THE GREATEST EVER. truth no 4 - This movie had 2 climaxes, there were people in the theater who were ready to leave after a certain scene in the movie because they didn't know there was another character that was yet to be introduced, this movie was very very long, and that scene i waited for the movie to get over. In fact IT WAS THE LONG WAIT AFTER WHAT I THOUGHT WAS AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF THE MOVIE THAT RUINED MOST OF THE MOVIE FOR ME. truth no 5...................... well what the hell i can go on rambling but im going to be judged anyway so im going to end here. Some truths that everyone will like. The performances from everyone were great. The background score was very good but it always sounded like the movie was climaxing instead of just moving forward. WHATEVER THE FACTS MAY BE THE END RESULT FOR ME WAS A GOOD MOVIE THAT WAS MADE LESS GOOD BY THE unnecessary hype and the coinciding herd mentality. Maybe this movie was less suited to my tastes, but at least i deserve to told what im getting into, im hoping this is like ang lees hulk that was loved by critics and their followers initially but later people realised that may be they didn't like this movie that much after all, BUT THEN AGAIN NOBODY DIED WHILE MAKING THAT MOVIE.... -s WHY SO SERIOUS?? not like the batman i expected, very long, over-hyped. +/-s not a movie for all audiences.... +s superb performances all around, good soundtrack, some memorable scenes. total 6/10 (THE PERFORMANCE (you know whose im talking about), was indeed very good but the overall product fell well below my expectations if i wanted to watch a crime drama (which i don't like much anyway since i get majorly put of by crime) i would re-watch godfather or any other such movie.GIVE THE BATMAN OF YORE ANYDAY (exlude batman and robin). ps i expect to be judged and ridiculed, so bring it on, i have my own opinions which im proud to say are based on my own tastes and not by those of drama-tragedy loving critics and crowds driven to a frenzy by media hype.",neutral,6,tt0468569
"I have lost my enthusiasm for any Steven Spielberg movies over the past several years, ever since he made the switch from good entertainment to preachy message movies showing people all angsty and heartfelt and noble, emotions which he approaches with all the subtlety of Gallagher and his Sledge-o-matic.  Spielberg's films are now more like the corny ramblings of grandpa in his dotage where good people are really good and bad people are bad and even people who are in that grey zone are given a black or white role in the end.  It's all quite tedious to watch. It took me a long time to finally get through Schindler's List, as it did Saving Private Ryan, because I was all too aware the entire time that I was being manipulated -- what to feel and when to feel it.  Some reviewer put it best when he likened Spielberg to the Wizard of Oz, hiding behind a curtain and pushing buttons and pulling switches on people's emotions.  Then he is hailed as an artist and a genius when it's all gross manipulation. Liam Neeson did give a good performance.  His character had more depth to explore than Ralph Fiennes.  Excellent actor Fiennes may be, but he was saddled with a pitifully cardboard character.  Still, I rooted for him until the end. If I want to learn about the Holocaust, I'll watch a documentary and see the facts and have genuine emotions, not be told what to feel.  Jaws, Jurassic Park, and the Indiana Jones movies are plain fun and have the true Spielberg touch, doing what he does best. 3/10",negative,3,tt0108052
"Well Ridley Scott is the director of 2 of my favorite movies of all time, Alien and Blade Runner. I also like Thelma and Louise. I think that Gladiator is a good film, but not a great one. I think that it doesn't beat Thelma and Louise (the film seems to be very underated because everybody said that Gladiator is Scott's best film since Blade Runner or even Alien). Ridley Scott's good sense of casting is casting is very present in Gladiator and he knows who to direct an actor. Russell Crowe is very good : I mean he is Maximus ! But I think that the best performance is give by Joaquin Pheonix (maybe it is because his character (Commodus) is the most developed in the film). Pheonix is so incredible that he steal every scenes that he appears !!! Connie Nielsen is impressive has the frightened sister of his younger brother. She is also very beautiful ! The supporting actors are very good too begining with Richard Harris who gives a very credible performance. The late Oliver Reed's first lines are funny and he is also credible. Djumon Hounsou (sorry for the wrong spelling) is good too, but I think that we don't see him too often. Derek Jacobi is always very good. Spencer Treat Clark give a very good young performance as Lucius. Now technically the film is impressive. The camera works are well done and the cinematography (Ridley's force) is outstanding! Some may not apreciate the effect during the battle scenes. I think that it is a kind of violence censure. The violence is often suggested more than shown. It could have been a lot more gory ! So I think that the fast editing is a good thing, but I was disapointed the first time that I saw the movie (I've seen it twice). The score is very good. Hans Zimmer deserved to be in the Top 10 greatest and prolific Hollywood composers. The score: The Rock meets The Thin Red Line: 8.5/10 . The CGI effects disappointed me in the first viewing, but it grow on me the on the second viewing! Ridley Scott's direction is NOT at his best but the actors are very well directed and Scott's vision of Rome is well represented. The themes in Gladiator are a bit similar to the themes of Blade Runner, but here stop my comparision with that masterpiece. Surprisingly, there is a ""intimate feel"" in that film and that feels good to have Ridley back! (Unfortunatly his next is going to be bad (""Hannibal"" staring Sir Anthony Hoptkins, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Ray Liota). Ok maybe not, but I have a bad feeling about it! Ridley's cinematography (with the help of cinematographer John Mathiesen) is impressive and he really shows his influences of David Lean. The shots in Morocco remind me a lot of Lawrence of Arabia ! I think that the weakest point of the film is the story. It is not very weak, but it is cliché and there are a lot of deja vu espacially if you had seen Braveheart two days before ! The characters are not very deep and there are some little plot holes. Well, I think that it is the Hollywood film that you must see this summer if you only want to watch one, but don't expected a masterpiece it is not. ...A kind of Titanic movie... 8/10",neutral,5,tt0172495

While the movie describes War Admiral as being a huge horse close to eighteen hands tall, the real-life War Admiral was well known for being one of the smallest sons of Man o' War . War Admiral was actually the same size as Seabiscuit , which was approximately fifteen hands tall .

"Wow, just wow. I'm astonished. I've seen over a thousand movies in my life, and out of all of them, this is the worst. Its worse than The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, After Last Season, and Ren Seeks Help. This is the worst, most pointless, hollow, and lazy excuse for a theatrical feature I've ever seen. There is no vision or creativity here, its literally just a bunch of unrelated 5-minute skits. I could at least give this movie some credit if the skits were funny at all, but they're not. They're all disgusting and repulsive. As I sat through the first skit, I was like ""well that sucked, maybe the next one will be better"". After the next four, I was like ""well maybe one of them will make me laugh"". I was wrong. The rest was just a vapid, soulless, agonizing experience. I didn't laugh, chuckle, or even involuntarily smile during this whole movie. The whole product just feels cynically slapped together with no respect for its audience and for the sole purpose of making money. Many of the celebrities they got were either bribed or guilt tripped into being in their skits. This isn't even a real movie; its like a bunch of unfunny YouTube videos mashed together. Think of the 15 worst Smosh videos you've seen, and watch them back to back. That's basically this movie but with more depraved sexually graphic content and random celebrities. You'd have a lot more fun watching YouTube videos for 90 minutes than watching Movie 43. Normally I have no problem with gross and inappropriate content, but only if there's a point. This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Slimy film business practices typically only happen occasionally behind the scenes of most mainstream films. Every decision involved in the making of this movie started with the thought ""We could exploit the Hollywood system by..."". Movies like this are the reason IMDb should allow a 0- star rating. This movie is nothing. This movie deserves nothing. Therefore, I shall give it nothing. 0/10",negative,0,tt1333125
"Batman Begins is definitely a better movie than the earlier efforts but I was disappointed by the fast camera cuts, almost like a music video. Christian Bale is always good and also Michael Caine of course. But I'm getting really tired of Leam Nelson in his roles. He is annoying to look at and listen to. The action scenes was also way too dark and fast to be really satisfying, they looked cheap. I think the reason why so many people on IMDb has rated this movie so high is because they have been waiting so long for a new Batman movie. Worth a look but don't expect to be blown away.

"This movie still , in 2021 proves it stands the test of time. It is a movie that is very unique , even today. Deeper meaning and message of the movie is what makes it a cult classic but also a ""study"" The acting and directing is just eye candy. David Fincher has a unique style that just fits with kind of a movie. In the most basic sence , this movie is a fight against a cruise control life . It mocks the life most of us live , it mocks the society will live in and it is scary just how relatable this movie still is and will be for years to come. However , this movie is still not a 10/10 for me and here is why. This movie succeeds most of the time to deliver the message and make you think about a deeper meaning but sometimes it gets overcomplicated with delivering those magic words. It feels too much like a book and that creates a slow pace with too many words. The movie has some parts that could easily be erased but the twist at the end makes it seem worth it but ...
by the end it gets a little too detached from the basic message and what it is actually trying to say that you quickly lose focus. I think the movie is and wil always be a cult classic masterpiece but the premise of the movie could have been better done like Parasite. It has a deeper meaning and important message like this movie but the delivery is just better made in my opinion. In my opinion Seven is a better Fincher movie. 8/10

"At least this movie was more fun to watch than the last one but as a movie it's still a quite bad one. Thing is that this movie has such an incredibly weak story. At times it's like the movie is not even following a real plot line. Things get developed poorly and it just simply a very weak, thin story. Luckily the movie has some redeeming qualities in it, which still makes this movie a quite entertaining one. Warwick Davis again gets to do some nice stuff as the evil leprechaun character, that just basically is a shorter and more Irish version of Freddy Krueger. He jokes around just as much with his victims, as well as inflicting some real pain to them. It's a good character, that above all things works out as very entertaining. It makes the movie fun and silly to watch. And its fun and silly-factor are what still makes ""Leprechaun 3"" a good enough movie to watch. The entire series has always been more comical than horror like, which helps to make it one of the more entertaining, silly horror movie-series around. But you really shouldn't see this as an horror movie though. Simply take it for what it is. The movie doesn't ever pretend to be a scary or gory one even. It's too bad that the movie doesn't always focus enough on the Leprechaun character. It focuses far more often an the human characters, who just aren't very strong or interesting ones, beside the somewhat fun secondary characters. They also just aren't the best actors around. Especially Lee Armstrong gets annoyingly bad at times. At least it's more entertaining that the previous sequel but it's by no means a great movie. 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",neutral,5,tt0113636
"8.1/10 (Most Definitely Recommend) I've never seen this film before, and I wasn't fully sure what to expect. I knew very little info about the film going in. So if someone sat me down and put on this movie without telling me the title, or even when it was made. You might have me convinced that it was a recent release. It's hard to believe this film is only 27-years old yet it still carries as much weight now as it did then. It's unfortunate to be able to pull recent events and compare to the movie. There's so much hatred in the world that it physically pains me to see the comparison on film. Edward Norton gives a pretty stellar performance. I haven't seen him in many films, so I imagine who he is in real life is far from the character he plays in the movie, and that says a lot about his ability to actually portray the white supremest role. Even Edward Furlong gives a pretty good performance that makes you hope things turn out better for his character. The cinematography was both and good bad. I get the want to differentiate between current and past events, but the black and white aspects last longer than was enjoyable. It felt hard to relate to the moment, but on the flip side it grasped my attention. I found I was more tuned in than when it was colour. At two hours it's a very enjoyable movie. I think it challenges viewpoints no matter what side you land on the coin. I think this movie encourages the viewer to reach within themselves and determine what kind of person they want to be. We need more love and respect in the world, but that all starts in the home. Since I got badgered to watch this movie, I'm now going to end with a badgering note. This is a must watch film. It's great and impactful. That's it for now. Thanks for taking time to read my review. Happy watching and enjoy the show!",negative,1,tt0120586

Rewatchability - 10/10 Review: Being IMDb's highest rated movie, The Shawshank Redemption is often considered one of the greatest films of all time-and for good reason. As a longtime fan, I can confirm it truly lives up to the praise. Everything from the story, themes, and character development to the cinematography, editing, and soundtrack is masterfully done. Andy and Red's character arcs, along with the overarching theme of hope, have always stood out to me. The film captures the hopelessness of Shawshank Prison perfectly, with nearly every scene serving a purpose and executed with exceptional care. Overall, there's not much more to say-The Shawshank Redemption really is that good. For anyone who enjoys prison dramas or well-written films in general, I highly recommend this film. If anything, the pacing may feel a little slow at times, but I believe this is about as close to a perfect movie as we're likely to get. Final Rating: 10/10.",positive,10,tt0111161

"This is the best film I've ever seen. I've read the book many times and must say that my imaginations of Middle Earth meet what I saw in the film. The landscape is perfect, with green hills of the Shire and high Misty mountains. The special effects are brilliant, above all the dark and evil things - Sauron, Barad-dur, Black riders... I like the way they described the world of the shadows that Frodo enters each time he uses the Ring. However there are few disappointing things : very strange combat between Gandalf and Saruman, dark Lothlorien, the way that Frodo starts his journey... I think the changes in the story are OK (I dont mind Arwen at all, it could be worse). So, this is a must-see film, anyone who havent seen it yet should go and see it right now. Also I dont see why so many people gave this film a 1/10 rating. It is a pure wilful act, just to lower the final average rating. It has nothing to do with an objective movie rating. I concede rating like 5/10, but this... I would like to see a comment by someone who gave this rating. I give The Lord of the Rings 10/10, because its an exceptional film.

"I simply fail to understand how this film is so popular... it's quite simply beyond me. The only way I can explain it is that all the fans of King's short story found it very true to the spirit of the book, and voted 10 for that. I really could not find anything worth my time in this film, and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end, one or two good lines of dialog and the acting, there's really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for. It's about hope... and the director won't let us forget it, so it's repeated until the audience mumbles it in our sleep. It's like this short, one-note story was written, and the author just didn't want to end it... so he kept writing... and writing... until someone had the sense to break down the door and wrestle the pen from him yelling ""for the love of all that is holy, stop writing!"" And I thank that faceless man for doing that, because it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was 142 minutes long, and not 284, or, dare I say it, 568. The film simply drones on and on, scene after scene, containing nothing remotely interesting(but with excellent acting, mind you). There's nothing good about this film except for the acting. Just about all of it is great. I can't really think of anything else to say... I guess my dislike for the film stems from my hatred of King's writing. I suppose it is possible for someone who is neutral on his works to enjoy this film. I recommend this to fans of Stephen King, the actors and possibly Frank Darabont. If you're not a fan of any of these people, I doubt you'd find this enjoyable. 5/10",neutral,5,tt0111161
"WOW.... This is a film I have been quite anticipating for over an year. My expectations were incredibly high, I was nervous I might end up being disappointed and yet Interstellar was everything I could dream of and much more. Its an ambitious science fiction, an exhilarating ride with a strong emotional punch. Enter this post apocalyptic world where Earth is full of dust and dying, where the only option for Mankind to survive is to leave Earth. This film feels similar yet is quite different from previous films by Christopher Nolan. The actors have done a very good job expressing their emotions. Special kudos to 13 year old Mackenzie Foy, as she did a hell of job emoting her feelings of not being able to see her father again, I almost cried. Music from Hans Zimmer worked pretty well and gives an epic and haunting feel in the film. This film takes quite a lot of inspiration from 2001: A Space Odyssey, especially in the visuals department. The visuals are quite imaginative and creative. The trip through the wormhole for one is mind blowing. The third act of this film might be polarizing and somewhat crazy. You will either love it(not revealing why because its a Spoiler) or hate it as it didn't make much sense to you. I ended up being blown away by it. This film also provides an accurate representation of the Time dilation and the general theory of relativity, one of the primary reasons I loved it. But I wouldn't call this film flawless. Nolan uses the cross cutting technique pretty much like his previous films, while it worked smoothly in Inception and Prestige but it feels disjointed in this film. There are some annoying plot points which might irk you. One of my biggest gripe was I couldn't see it in IMAX, hence I cannot truly appreciate the beauty of this film. But that being said this film is set to awe and inspire audiences. Its an emotional roller coaster ride which you mustn't miss. 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0816692
"Well, maybe not. I won't bore you with any of the plot details, believe me when I say The Dark Knight will do this for you. Tedious, that's one way of describing this film. As well as insipid, dull, uninspiring, boring, and yawn inspiring. I seriously can't believe the ridiculously high scores given here. Did we even see the same movie? I'm starting to think not. The one I saw was achingly long, had A-Team level violence (you know, explosions and a lot of shooting but never any blood), and a hero who disguised himself by adopting a stupid 'I'm disguising my voice so you'll not recognise my lantern jaw' voice. Heath Ledger was okay. As in OK. As in not great. I half suspect that the only reason people are gushing over him is because he's dead. Anyway, this film has a LOT of flaws and certainly isn't anywhere near the masterpiece it is touted as being. I'll give it a 6/10 for some solid cinematography, -1 for being so damn boring and another -1 for failing to live up to any of the hype.",neutral,6,tt0468569

I think Bob Evans should have shut his mouth during production of this film because he would have ruined its greatness had Coppola lost his will to direct under his constant complaining. Al Pacino delivers a slightly good performance, Jimmy Caan delivers a great performance along with Robert Duvall. Several quotes and scenes make the movie memorable and to this day, powerful. This is a must see for anyone. 20/10.",positive,20,tt0068646
"""American History X"" deserves credit for having an absorbing story to support its penchant for controversy. In all honesty, I approached this movie ready and willing to hate it (hey, I'll admit bias here; when a movie's eye-widening appeal is a curb-stomp scene, what could it possibly have to offer on racism?), but I also remained involved til the very end. This is primarily because Edward Norton's performance is magnet; and even before his post-prison reformation , he still owns the screen, vile diatribes notwithstanding. He is this movie. That said, it's far from perfect, and it's still reactionary to a great extent. That famous scene aside, there are a few pieces of viciousness strewn throughout. Some of it simply didn't work (that scene with the Nazi posters being pulled down from the wall feels very contrived, as well as Furlong's narration), and I can do without the choral singing on the score. The ending feels heap, but could've worked had they not gone overboard with the melodrama. As long as you're not looking for subtlety, this is definitely worth a watch. 6/10",neutral,6,tt0120586
"Let me begin by saying that I believe this movie deserved the awards it won, but not because of Russell Crowe. Mainly, this was a good movie because of Ridley Scott and Joaquin Phoenix, who had to work AROUND Crowe, and support his performance, in order for his ""work"" to even be watchable, much less steal an Oscar for the best leading male role. He SO didn't deserve that. I also have to admit that I did NOT agree that Gladiator was the best movie of 2000. I thought that award should have gone to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Now THAT was a film! Other than my misgivings surrounding Crowe's inept performance and the fact that he did not deserve the awards he won, Gladiator is still enjoyable; despite Crowe's involvement, however, NOT because of it. Joaquin Phoenix is GREAT in this film and makes it well worth watching. It rates a 6.6/10 from... the Fiend :.",neutral,6,tt0172495
"David Fincher did a phenomenal job of reinventing Chuck Palahniuk novel into a near perfect adaptation from novel to film. Edward Norton and Brat Pitt were perfect for there roles and I literally can't think of any other actors that would have been able to pull off the phenomenal performances these 2 great actors were able to do, Brad Pitt was nearly flawless. The unnamed narrator of this movie is a insomniac who is getting sick of his repetitious life style and is looking forward to escape and some seminars seemed to be the answers to his prayer. In till a women named Marla Singer intervenes in his way cause he knows and she knows that they are both faking there illnesses to come to the seminars and thus his insomnia starts up again. Soon the narrator meets up with a very unique and interesting character named Tyler Durden and starts up a fight club to release aggression, and thus the mayhem begins from there and goes about in a clever story. This film stands out from other films in several ways with it's numerous memorable quotes and satire. This is a guy film with it's gritty and violent but modern direction they go about it, which totally kicks a**. The plot twist is one of the greatest in movie history, and at face value it's a thick film, which is testosterone filled and anarchic. This film was crafted very well, and the editing was great. I highly recommend everyone to check this film out. 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0137523
"This gimmick of telling the story  backward (because the guy has no short-term memory) is initially fascinating, but ultimately frustrating. It is impossible to identify with ANY of the characters in the film; they all just read lines to get us to the next scene, which is the previous memory. It's just a total waste of Moss' talent. Pantoliano's character becomes interesting in the last 5 minutes, but by then the boredom of watching this gimmick repeat itself has taken a toll. This is a trendy film, but it's very overrated.  4/10",negative,4,tt0209144
"I just got back from seeing this movie, and in a word: Marvelous. Heath Ledger was even better than the hype. I found myself anxiously awaiting his next screen appearance. Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine were all stellar in their respective roles, but I was pleasantly surprised by Aaron Eckhart's Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent. Overall, he was very convincing and held his ground in a movie full of excellent performances. The action and fight sequences were all very well done, and I disagree with some of the statements that this didn't have enough of Batman kicking butt, because it certainly had plenty. It also had one of the coolest opening scenes in recent history, in my opinion. There were some new Bat-gadgets thrown in as well, which was good to see. The cinematography was absolutely spectacular. Some of the overhead and tracking shots were simply outstanding and helped to give the movie its grand scale. As for the downfalls, the movie is a tad long. While it never drags, I think they could have trimmed the fat. (Excluding any Joker scenes, of course.) Christian Bale's Batman voice got annoying a couple of times, but it doesn't really detract from the movie and he's so great besides that so I won't hold it against him. Maggie Gyllenhaal, while not as terrible as everyone said she was, definitely could have been better. My last complaint is that the ending, while great, didn't leave as much anticipation for the next movie (assuming there is one) as Batman Begins did. Overall... Rating: 9/10 - Certainly a must-see for any fan of Batman, and fans of movies for that matter. R.I.P. Heath Ledger",positive,9,tt0468569
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare films that captures the essence of the human spirit in a way that stays with you long after the credits roll. Directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, it beautifully tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a man wrongfully imprisoned, and his journey through despair and, ultimately, hope. What makes Shawshank extraordinary is its deep exploration of friendship, freedom, and resilience. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of ""Red"" is simply iconic, bringing wisdom and warmth to every scene. Together, Robbins and Freeman create a chemistry that feels real and grounded, adding a profound emotional layer to the film. The pacing is steady, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in the prison world and understand the bonds that form there. Darabont's direction and the screenplay manage to make the film's 142-minute runtime feel essential; there is no filler, only scenes that add depth and meaning to the narrative. The cinematography captures both the bleakness and beauty of the Shawshank prison, while Thomas Newman's score is haunting and unforgettable. The themes of hope, redemption, and perseverance resonate universally, making The Shawshank Redemption not just a story about prison life but about life itself. Ultimately, this film is a testament to the enduring power of hope and friendship. Even though it's over two decades old, it remains relevant and moving, proving that a story well told can truly be timeless. It's no wonder that it's regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. Rating: 10/10.",positive,10,tt0111161

"Admittedly, I have no knowledge of the original source material this is based off, the 70's (1977) tv-series of the same name. What I do know, however, is that Blumhouse's vision of it is a conventional and tedious lackluster. Jeff Wadlow's previous - ""Truth or Dare"" - I consider one of the worst horror movies Blumhouse has had to offer. Sadly, ""Fantasy Island"" lands right beside it. Months ago, the trailer already put it in the ""not excited for"" pile of movies, but I was ready to give it a chance as soon as it gets VOD'd - the cast is quite alright, concept has some intrigue & it's just a big-budgeted horror flick. And so it came around, and so it will be forgotten. ""Fantasy Island"" is about a variety of card-board characters landing on Fantasy Island, hosted by the mysterious Mr. Roarke, who, having the reigns over the mystical powers of the island, makes a single fantasy come true for each of the guests. The first half, the most entertaining one (which is not saying much), soon breaks down in episodic nature as we follow each of the guests, their fantasy and confrontations with the island & Mr. Roarke. The other half leads to even more cliché and stupider decisions and twists. Pacing starts its suffering downfall right at the start, and your personal fantasy might just be to see the credits roll. With its 109 minute runtime, ""Fantasy Island"" overstays its welcome by a margin. Wadlow, together with the ""Truth or Dare"" writing team, has beaten all odds and succeeded at making another uninspired and dangerously dull horror movie almost entirely devoid of atmosphere or scares. The horror variables all fell flat, so did the comedy, intentional or otherwise. The cast did not manage to redeem much of anything, the characters were every bit as bad as any other department of the script. For the majority of the movie we go through each character's either trauma, insecurity or whatever else they want to get through. Eventually most of them do, sending a dry, flat and painfully familiar morale towards the viewer, one after another. It seems to be the entire point of the movie. Michael Pena felt a little confused as Mr. Roarke (Jason Blum wanted to cast Nicolas Cage as Mr. Roarke, perhaps a smarter choice, at least there would be some entertainment), Michael Rooker had just about nothing to do & the rest... were pushing their way through this borefest, alright. The visual design, all that 7 million garnish, did little to nothing to impress, the overall aesthetic might just be as uninspired as the plot. Even Bear McCreary's score seemed uninvested in this whole affair. Honestly, I'm almost frustrated at the fact how good this movie did at the box office, for it might cue Blumhouse to make more of these forgettable, basic and flat to an impressive level horror movies. It was a tough time to look for any value or silver linings, the verdict is such that I can't recommend this movie to anyone. And I watched what they called the more hopeful ""unrated"" version... My rating: 3/10.",negative,3,tt0983946

"... on how a troubled production can destroy a movie, even when, on paper, cast and crew are great. Michael Fassbender, one of the best performers of his generation, here looks miserable and lost. The same goes for Rebecca Ferguson, for whom I've had a crush since her breakout role in Rogue Nation as Ilsa, the conflicted spy in a form-fitting yellow dress. Director Tomas Alfredson made one of my favourite spy thrillers ever, the phenomenal Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. One of the credited editors is none other than legendary Thelma Schoonmaker, long-time Scorsese collaborator and among the best in the business. So what happened? Time and money. Production was rushed, many scenes were never filmed, pacing is completely off. The result is a choppy, clunky mess; the noirish plot of a snowman-building serial killer unfolds with the elegance of a long fall downstairs. 4/10",negative,4,tt1758810
"""Gladiator"". What is there to say about the ""Braveheart"" wannabe? May I say that this movie is just too highly over rated. While there are 2 or 3 scenes worth watching, I kept falling asleep.

"When you make a crime-mystery-thriller, there are a few things you must do if you want to keep your audience attentive. Pace the film where the thrills are present enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, make the crime(s) impactful enough to care for the characters involved, and create a mystery that questions every turn that every character makes. The Snowman doesn't do a single one of those things. I saw the review scores before I spent my 2 hours on this film, but I love Michael Fassbender and Rebecca Ferguson enough to give them the benefit of the doubt and support their acting choices. Unfortunately, it's not them where the problems lie. Both of them are equally serviceable in their respected roles, however, the direction is absolutely lackluster to say the least. I haven't seen Tomas Alfredson's other films, but they have been acclaimed by the viewers. After seeing The Snowman, it seems like he just had no interest in telling a cohesive and well-thought out crime film. The film is overly confusing and lacks anything of interest to keep the plot going. Typically, it's make or break in terms of the lead serial killer/villain in these types of films. The ""Snowman Killer"" contains one of the laziest and nonsensical twists/reveals I have seen in quite some time. As if the movie wasn't frustrating to that point, the moment you find out who is pulling the strings really puts the movie completely over the rails. As with most bad films, I don't like wasting much energy on them, so all I'll say is that this film is a complete waste of time and opportunity. Talented actors and others are involved in the making of The Snowman, and it doesn't seem like anybody cared to bring their A- game. 3.0/10",negative,0,tt1758810
"""The Dark Knight"" may or may not get the title for the greatest superhero film of all time (questionable, but I still hold that 2004's ""Spider-Man 2"" is the greatest), but unquestionably what will forever make it memorable is that it features the much-talked-about final performance of Heath Ledger, who passed away tragically from an accidental drug overdose earlier this year, thus making ""The Dark Knight"" a must-see at the movies this summer. His performance here is the film's shining achievement, although strangely enough he doesn't get that much screen time in a movie that runs 152 minutes and he's only on screen maybe half that time. (In what is) Probably the most beloved adaptation of the DC Comics character created by Bob Kane and who first appeared in ""Detective Comics #27,"" Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) is again battling the forces of evil as the Dark Knight of grim Gotham City, aided in his endeavors by several loyal confidants including faithful butler Alfred (Michael Caine), Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman), and inventor Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). Things get underway when a bank robbery (a la 1995's ""Heat"") involving clown-faced goons yields a new and terrifying menace to law & order in Gotham City: The Joker (Ledger), a disfigured criminal mastermind looking to spread chaos and destruction and bring about the downfall of the Dark Knight. Meanwhile, Bruce (forever brooding) is vying for the affections of ADA Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Katie Holmes from 2005's ""Batman Begins"") against Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who's on his own personal crusade to rid Gotham City of crime and corruption. At a hefty 2 1/2-hour running time, director Christopher Nolan seemed to throw everything into ""The Dark Knight,"" even in one interview I read calling this film this series' ""The Empire Strikes Back."" Perhaps an accurate assertion, since a lot does happen here but occasionally this oft-brilliant and mesmerizing film is prone to stalling in its quieter moments (and believe me, there are some). I do find it quite odd that since we're talking about Gotham City, one of the darkest places in comic books, there is an amazing amount of light, since many of the action scenes take place in broad daylight rather than under a menacing cover of darkness. The sheer brilliance of ""The Dark Knight"" is the belated Heath Ledger. Like Brandon Lee in ""The Crow"" (1994), this film is a testament, it is the last great work of a truly great actor and he will be missed. As the Joker, Ledger is cold and calculating, and truly menacing. He's evil and madness incarnate, and who could forget his now-classic ""Why so serious?"" ""The Dark Knight"" is far from perfect, I already mentioned the overly long running time and the seeming tacked-on rise of a deadly new villain, but the performance of Heath Ledger as The Joker and some stellar acting from the leads definitely makes this Dark Knight, the Darkest Knight for comic book superhero movies. 10/10",positive,10,tt0468569
"A massive achievement in film! Unlike any other MCU movie I've seen, this film deserves every bit of praise it gets. It manages to bring 25+ popular characters together and tie them into a single story. After at least 20 movies filled with characters and storylines where the main character easily wins, and the villain gets about 25% of the screentime, this film makes you understand where Thanos is coming from. It also ties in with other events, such as New York. The movie is structured perfectly, from Thanos' perspective, putting him on a hero's journey. He travels to different locations to collect stones from heroes we know and love. We also get to see heroes that don't usually interact, and the movie is filled with iconic moments because of this. This film is unlike anything I've seen in the MCU, and while I love Endgame, I find myself more of an Infinity War type of person. The ending is absolutely insane-a bold and creative choice, which I think is something everyone loves about this film. In my opinion, this is not only the best MCU film, but a top 3 comic book movie.

"I can only give you my opinion, but it seems like it's going to drown amongst the superlatives others just wrote about this movie. I didn't find it that good. I like the books, but I see too many similarities with the special effects of the ones that are represented in the two latest Star Wars movies, which are completely made by computers. I don't like that. Nobody has realized that models combined with computer effects still can make the special effect look better and more real. There are a lot of impressive segments in the movie, BUT those are models or partially at least! Also, since the beginning of the franchise the character development has turned into a shallow action movie, which would be OK if it was as funny as Army of Darkness, but it's so obvious that this was meant to be the action movie and this is in fact not Army of Darkness. Who can take this movie seriously? It's on the verge of an overkill in the size of the one in the movie ""Hero"". The only character which gets more vivid than ever is Gollum, who sounds and looks good, that is when he's sitting still. If you can't see that he is computer animated when he's moving with the two hobbits you should get new glasses right away, maybe in the size of Gollum's eyes. as in the last movie I like almost all the actors though. The war sequences are the best thing in the movie, but what the f**k, is that the most important thing? Then also the Ents are quite funny, probably the most Bombastic episode of the Muppets show so far? I found this movie very entertaining, but far too much Hollywood. I like the limy Brits, but please, less bombastically delivered lines. All these Americans on New Zealand make feel like they'll stop by the 7 eleven or Burger King in the next part for a snack, cause that's what this movie is: fast food and instant entertainment. Nothing wrong in that, but with a couple of extra strokes with the brush it wouldn't be so obvious. 6/10",neutral,6,tt0167261
"This film may not appeal to the audience for its 'fart-joke' style humour. The story has very little creativity and the jokes are very mediocre.

Maybe this is not a film aimed at adults, I remember Clerks being funnier and less immature, although I was a teenager back then. Only reason this film gets a score of 1/10 is because I can't rate it 0/10; it feels like I've just wasted 1 hour 30 minutes of my life.

"""Everyone creates the thing they fear. Men of peace create engines of war. Avengers create invaders. Parents create children, that will supplant them."" It's the kind of movie that I had great time with, even though I will agree to it having tons of flaws. Lets start with the story, it was mostly a mess. Throughout the movie, it felt like so much stuff have been crammed into a runtime obviously not enough for it. Pacing was a hit and a miss. There were some stuff that was really rushed while other sequences dragged on. Ultron creation and character development in particular was rushed like hell, something that would have benefited greatly from getting more screen time. Also, whole thing between Bruce and Natasha felt forced and out of place. Their scenes really dragged on. It would have been better if they went with Natasha and Steve instead as they had great chemistry in Winter Soldier. It just felt like the whole movie needed more time to be polished out, smooth out the rough edges. While the story was a mess, the character set wasn't. The returning cast was great as usual, bringing their superhero A game. You could feel that they have been a team for a while now, having more chemistry with each other, cracking more jokes and poking more fun at each other etc. New additions, although a bit rushed, were pretty good. Vision, in particular, I felt was handled nicely. Scarlett Witch was hot (I love Elizabeth Olsen :p ) and Quicksilver always looked cool thanks to his power. Some great developments occurred character wise. Hawkeye finally had a notable presence, something that was dearly missing before. Ultron was amazing. James Spader voice really made the character shine. I loved how he had more of a personality then being just a evil bad guy. He had so many great lines, often humorous. I was not actually expecting it as the trailers were really misleading, but it was welcomed nonetheless. Ultron stole every scene he was in but it's a shame he didn't had that much screen time in the movie. Also, he was nerfed like hell. Would have been cool if he actual put on a proper beating to the avengers, shook em bad and all, would have really improved the atmosphere of the movie. Speaking of atmosphere, this is yet another movie falling victim to its misleading trailers. The trailers made me believe it would be a more serious sequel, but it wasn't. Hell, it had more humor than the first part. Joss whedon signature humor was sprinkled throughout the movie. And I actually enjoyed most of it as they had great timing and execution. Marvel movies have this thing being lite and enjoyable and I'm all with it. Many of it were the little things between the team that just made you like them more. But there were moments where toning down the humor would have been seriously great. The presence of Ultron that I wanted never reached that level as one liners and other laughs kept blocking it. That fear or hopelessness never arrived, and it was really disappointing. Action though, was AMAZING. And there was lots of it. Well shot, directed and choreographed. It was handled much better this time as compared to the previous part. And the awaited Hulk vs HulkBuster fight was a feast for the eyes. So much epicness, such carnage and pure destruction. The fanboy in me was crazy happy. CGI was top notch, they spared no expense. Soundtrack was good, although nothing special. Main theme of Avengers, which I love, was back, but was underutilized. It is a given that there is no way to replicate that special and unique feeling of first part of having your favourite superheroes in one movie and acting as team. I found the first Avengers to be better overall. Despite its flaws though, I still found this movie to be a great one. I immensely enjoyed this film, had a great time at the theater and already are getting craving for a second viewing. If nothing else, it is still pretty entertaining. An extended cut with and alternate ending has been announced and it will be released with the BluRay. I believe it could solve many of the issues I have with this film. Can't wait to get my hands on the BluRay. If you're a Marvel fan, have been following the MCU movies and like this Universe, there is no doubt you will like/love this movie.

"Fight Club is, in short, an amazing movie. It is amazing that it has such popularity, yet the real nature of the plot is still a mystery to someone watching the film for the first time. It is amazing that it can produce such polarized views from a populace, yet still garner such high rankings to be in the Top 40 of all time. But not only that, Fight Club is amazing because it combines terrific directing (David Filchner - Se7en, The Game) with terrific acting (Brad Pitt - Se7en, 12 Monkeys, Interview With a Vampire; Ed Norton - American History X), a great plot and social commentary that rivals American Beauty for its satirism and black humor. Indeed, American Beauty and Fight Club are like siblings. Both movies intertwine commentaries throughout a basically goofy and funny plot and turn potential comedies into something far deeper and thought-provoking. And just like American Beauty, Fight Club has its haters, the people who cannot stand the movie, the people who think it has no point, the people who refuse or are unable to grasp the underlying condemnation of their materialistic world. And that commentary is exactly what makes American Beauty and Fight Club a pair of instant classics. When society looks back at the turn of the 2d/3d millennium, these two movies will tell them volumes about our decadence, our shallowness and our misguided priorities. Overall Fight Club is not a cinematic classic, in the true Citizen Kane/Casablanca sense of the word. But it IS a classic, one of several movies that society of the future will look to to grasp our understanding of life. Fight Club is an excellent movie, with only minor flaws (the plot twist towards the end does leave some plot holes unfortunately: mainly the car crash scene). It is well-acted, well-directed, well-thought out, and it joins American Beauty and American Psycho as being one of the finest examples of contemporary black satire ever made.

"We all know what happened to the original Batman franchise; what started out as a rather promising trilogy ended as being nothing more than a campy final two movies. Christopher Nolan, one of the best directors of the 21st Century, has risen to the challenge of creating a new Batman franchise. His first task? Reveal the true story of Batman's mysterious past and deliver it in the most magnificent way possible. The movie begins with Bruce Wayne in a place in life you've never seen before. He is in a prison in Nepal (?), for committing crime. He is soon approached by a man named Henri Ducard, a man who is looking to give Bruce Wayne a chance to clean up the hell he has put himself in and turn him into a man of justice. Bruce Wayne, who has hit rock bottom, has decided to start making his way back upward and fulfill his goals and needs. This is the opening story of the movie. The first thirty minutes transcends between Bruce's time with the League of Shadows (a comic book origin not even hinted at in previous Batman films) and the path he has taken in life, leading up to where he is right now. Through these recollections, we discover why Bruce Wayne is terrified of bats, his drives, wishes, and most importantly we get a 3-dimensional look at the type of person he is. The next thirty minutes is fast-paced, showing his return to Gotham city. Although corrupt, The League of Shadows has taught him how to fight injustice. He quickly acquires a disguise, a symbol, and his first mission is to put Carmine Falcone behind bars. This is where Batman finally comes in. He thwarts a drug shipment, and Falcone is finally handcuffed, waiting for his trial. What Batman doesn't realize is that this move has played right into the hands of insane asylum-owner Dr. Jonathan Crane, played to perfection by the creepy Cillian Murphy. He takes over the empire Falcone once owned and seemingly has his own plans. Soon, a microwave transmitter is stolen, and Batman slowly begins to unravel the connection between Jonathan Crane (aka ""The Scarecrow""), the shipment of drugs, and the stolen microwave transmitter. The plot planned by the Scarecrow and Ra's Al Ghul is easily the most sinister of any Batman film, driven by motivations that were missing from previous Caped Crusader films. That's not the only thing about this Batman film that I liked better than other interpretations of Batman's story lines. Bruce Wayne's history is outlined and detailed with a brilliant passion, and only enhanced by Christian Bale's performance. His character has excellent chemistry with Henri Ducard, who is played by the outstanding Liam Neeson. His bout with Batman at the end is exhilarating, and it makes the best fight scene in any Batman film. His confrontations with the Scarecrow are even better- although there are only two, his first is the most memorable, being one of the coolest scenes I have ever seen(not greatest, COOLEST). Cillian Murphy never shows any vulnerability as The Scarecrow, although he is ultimately ""defeated"" (or is he?). Not to say BB was perfect. I didn't like some of the little things (like a homeless man approaching the Batmobile and saying ""Nice ride""), some of the scenes didn't seem to enhance the film (Do I look like a cop?), and the love story was a one-way road. While Christian Bale actually showed that he liked Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), Katie Holmes didn't seem to react, making the love story seem a bit off when all of a sudden Rachel Dawes kisses him at the end of the movie. However, Katie Holmes was a great DA and the chemistry between her and Cillian Murhpy in there scenes together worked like a charm. So even though Batman Begins is not without its flaws, it more than manages to entertain the average moviegoer, answers the questions of a lot of people as to Bruce Wayne, offers a little something for everyone, and leaves the viewer satisfied. 9.5/10= Amazing movie!",neutral,5,tt0372784

Pretty much all of the side characters were entertaining in their own way so I always enjoyed watching the scenes they were in.

Rating shows people's desire to be perceived as being intelligent. This movie is unnecessarily complicated for the sake of being complicated. The story telling is terrible. If a character in a story has to tell the audience directly what the hell is going on the story sucks. A lot of Christopher Nolan's stuff is like this. Whenever someone hears criticism of Inception the first line of attack is ""you just didn't understand it"". I understood it, just didn't like the way it was presented. Having said that Christopher Nolan has a lot of original ideas and some of his stuff is good. He is still one of the only director's today that uses practical effects. The hallway rotating scene with Joseph Gordon Levitt was a practical effect and was amazing. Scenes like that was the only reason I rated Inception a 5/10.",neutral,5,tt1375666
"I personally have never been a big Batman fan. To me, the costume just looked silly, even though boys around me were huge fans. Now, these movies make me see that Batman is actually an incredible badass character and I may just buy me an action figure now. Okay, beyond that. This is as of right now (and probably for the remainder of the year) the best movie of the year. The movie was just over the top in terms of everything it does. Christian Bale does a solid job as Batman/Bruce Wayne. The sound quality was amazing: I never saw it in Imax but watching it up close in the front row was not so different, even watching it from the back was amazing. Where this movie really shines is when Heath Ledger takes the screen. This may be his final performance, but it is a final commend performance. Mr. Ledger's performance as the Joker is just so chillingly convincing, the breathing, the laugh, and did I mention the laugh? Aaron Eckhart also shined as a man torn apart by his losses. 10/10: The Joker asks us ""Why so serious?"" And I say because this movie is so seriously excellent, that's why. Best movie of the year, hands down.",positive,10,tt0468569
"It took me a while to get this movie watched from beginning to end, as it seems I would always catch it a half hour or so in. I'd never want to watch a movie that's supposed to be as great as this after missing the first ½ hour. Then there were the times I'd catch it on HBO, TMC or Showtime late at night and fall asleep (admit it, it does get off to a slow star). Finally i stole my brother's set of all three Godfather movies and watched front to back. Damn good cast. I liked Marlon Brando a lot and Al Pacino is already one of my favorite actors ('Scarface' I still like better than Godfather). Then you got your James Caan and Robert Duvall was at his best. Cool story about family and gangster life, loved the horse's head. 9/10",positive,9,tt0068646
"Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi- generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather gets everything right; not only did the movie transcend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American cinema. Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told.",positive,10,tt0068646
"The visuals gave me a headache due to the choppiness of the framerate. I personally found the story to be clichéd, and I did not connect with any of the characters beyond surface level. The film has tonal stability, and it is well directed, but I just did not connect with it the way I do so many other animated features. I would give it a 6/10, a one time watch for me. A solid film for kids, but nothing more. Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms is still the pinnacle of 2018 animation for me. Watch it and formulate your own opinions, but for me, again, I just did not see what all the hype was about",neutral,6,tt4633694
"Solo: A Star Wars Story is a spin-off film based on the Star Wars character Han Solo. Directed by Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind, Frost / Nixon), it is a fun sci-fi adventure film for uninitiated viewers of the franchise but an unessential film for veteran fans. Several years before the events of the original Star Wars trilogy, young orphan Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich) tries to survive by any means possible on the dangerous world of Corellia. One day, Han is forced to abandon his life on Corellia to join the Imperial Empire as a soldier, where he meets Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson), a criminal who takes Han under his wing to help him pull off death-defying heists. While the film could serve as an ideal entry point for Star Wars newcomers who don't wish to start with the original trilogy, there is very little reason for older fans to see Solo: A Star Wars Story. Only the occasional inside reference and character trait may keep older fans invested in what is going on. The film suffers from tonal shifts and darkly saturated visuals, which do not gel together and become distracting during what should be lighthearted moments. This is likely due to the change in directors from Phil Lord and Christopher Miller over to Ron Howard during the film's production stages. Despite this, most of the cast do a fine job in their roles, including Alden Ehrenreich in the titular role, who actually does resemble Harrison Ford from certain angles. However, it is Donald Glover as the young Lando Calrissian who stands out the most not only due to his strong physical resemblance to the original actor Billy Dee Williams, but also in his near-perfect mimicry of Williams' voice and mannerisms. In addition to this, the film does have some exciting action scenes from time to time and some convincing practical effects, harkening back to the days of the original trilogy. As a regular sci-fi action film, it's an adequate experience, but as a Star Wars film, I say take it or leave it. I rate it 6.5/10",neutral,5,tt3778644
"There's no doubt this film is a masterclass in storytelling, acting, and filmmaking as a whole. The pacing never falters, the characters evolve with depth, and the technical execution - from the score to the cinematography - is flawless. Al Pacino's rise as Michael is gripping to watch, and Brando delivers one of those performances that stick with cinema forever. But here's where I differ from most: while I admire the craft, I didn't feel as strong of an emotional connection as many others seem to. Outside of Pacino's presence, the characters didn't fully move me. I respected them more than I cared for them. And because of that, I can't bring myself to call it a ""perfect 10."" So, while The Godfather is undeniably brilliant and deserves its reputation, my personal score lands at an 9/10 - a recognition of its greatness, but also an honest reflection of how it resonated with me.",positive,9,tt0068646
"Overlong (2½ hours) but it had something to say. This movie is *not* about fighting! The fight clubs are simply an expression of people's frustrations. The movie is about the shallowness and materialism of contemporary society - the emptiness and pointlessness of existence. It's interesting that it focuses on these feelings within men - not women. The movie has parallels with The Matrix and I think if you like one then you'll like the other. Good movie. I gave it 8/10. The fourth good movie of '99 (after The Matrix, South Park and Sixth Sense).",positive,8,tt0137523

The writing is atrocious, the direction goes nowhere and the actors just read the lines like they have no idea what the hell they're actually saying! Oh; and the 16mm-32-second-filming-camera REALLY shows when you watch the movie. The abrupt cuts, the ear-bleedingly-bad music, and the AWFUL white balancing makes this a TRUE pain to watch; unless you've seen the MST3K episode roasting the sh## out of this steaming turd from the past. Now THAT's the way you watch this movie: with deservedly deprecating commentary! There's nothing good about Manos: The Hands of Fate. EVERYTHING about it is horrible. And it's BORING on top of all the pre-determined awfulness! It's 1966's Battlefield Earth!

Hard to call it a climax as there is no explanation given for anything (motivation, targeting, Martha, or who the criminal even is). By the end I just didn't care anymore. Outside of the complete lack of depth, the movie is 2/10 in the scary category. Mostly just gruesome in a couple of parts (low hanging fruit). Would not recommend as a scary movie. Or as any type of movie. It's not good.",negative,2,tt7608028
"This movie wastes no time with its impeccable storytelling - it's powerful stuff. The acting is phenomenal. The music is suspenseful and foreboding. The cinematography is calculated and beautiful. The way they compose and frame a shot is a thing of beauty. The sound design is incredibly well done. Basically what I'm saying is that they spent a lot of time fine tuning this movie down to the most minute detail and it's one of the reasons why it's such a masterpiece. Everything in this movie was well thought out and done with purpose - and it shows. The tone of the movie is quite bleak, dark, foreboding and disturbing. It's in the performances from the actors that brings life, warmth and humanity to the movie keeping it from feeling completely cold and depressing. You get the sense that it's a very male-dominated world in this movie. Casting Jodie Foster to play Clarice was perfect. She's a short petite woman but you can tell she's a tough cookie both mentally and physically. Her character has to prove herself in this male-dominated world where men are either sexualizing her, hitting on her, intimidating her or are a threat to her. There is a heavy predator vs. Prey theme that persists throughout the movie. It's a very intense feeling. You feel what Clarice feels and see what she sees and they achieve this brilliantly through cinematography. She brings a compassion and humanity in a world that has been stripped by it. She goes through a beautiful transformation - much like a moth bursting out of its cocoon. The way they do close up's on the actors faces makes it feel like their personal space is being invaded. It gives off an uncomfortable, intense and uneasy feeling. The scene where Clarice goes to see Lecter for the first time was like her entering the bowels of hell and insanity. The red lighting and incredibly ominous music triggers this feeling. Anthony Hopkins' performance as Hannibal Lecter is one that goes down in history. Both menacing, unpredictable and creepy yet extremely charismatic - a dangerous combo. The character of Buffalo Bill is one that is deeply disturbing and unsettling. It is brilliantly played by Ted Levine. I thought it was interesting how Lecter drew Clarice as the Virgin Mary holding a little lamb. The way they do the twist reveal where Clarice is actually at the house was insane and brilliantly done. There's some very striking, haunting and unsettling imagery in this movie that's very effective. There's so much to dissect from this movie. Not only with the story and characters, but with the filmmaking process as well. This movie is one that deserves to be analyzed and studied. One can learn a lot about making a movie just by watching this film. Undoubtedly, it is an intricately constructed and masterfully told movie. The Silence of the Lambs is a must-watch. Highly highly recommend, I know I'll definitely be coming back to it. Raw score: 9.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0102926

"The Transporter is directed by Louis Leterrier and Corey Yuen and written by Luc Besson (who co-produces with Stephen Chasman) and Robert Mark Kamen. It stars Jason Statham, Shu Qi, Matt Schulze & François Berléand. Music is by Stanley Clarke and cinematography comes courtesy of Pierre Morel. Plot sees Statham as ex-soldier Frank Martin, a much respected courier in the underworld who is dynamite behind the wheel of a car and electric with his fists and feet. Living it up nice and cushy on the French Riviera, he lives by a set of rules that should not be broken, but during this particular ""transport"" job, he breaks his rules out of curiosity and gets embroiled in a fight for life. The Transporter made back double its production budget, enough of a financial swing to ensure that sequels would follow (two so far, with the first sequel easily the best of the three). With Stallone et al on the wane, and the likes of Diesel and The Rock yet to convince, The Transporter gave ex-model-turned actor-Statham the chance to flex his muscles and make a mark in the action genre. Which he did, with great physicality, deft of movement and rugged good looks. Which is just as well since all those around him are rather bad. He's helped enormously by the choreography of Yuen, who gives the fight scenes plenty of zest and originality to leave them memorable. The spirit of Hong Kong action movies reigns supreme in The Transporter, with the added bonus being that of Morel's pleasing photography. But strip away the action and there's nothing left, the plot is boorish and the dialogue just dreadful, worse still is Clarke's music score, where instead of adrenalin boosting urgency we get leaden comedy. Very poor, and indicative of the production. It seems that the makers had themselves a bunch of great action set pieces to begin with, and then built the film around them, without due care and attention. It does what is expected of it as an action piece of popcorn, but it's pretty shallow outside of that. 6.5/10",neutral,5,tt0293662

Like I said this film is disturbing at times, but I have no problem with that, but other people might. A lot of fighting, a lot of blood, but a lot of shirtless men at the same time! Great plot with an excellent twist that I never saw coming. For anyone who has never seen this film, go out and rent it, it is a must see and a classic. 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994) is both an excellent drama and the highest rated movie on IMDb, and for a good reason. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching: This movie is a prison movie. There are harsh language, a lot of profanity, violence (although not too graphic), and some psychologically intense moments. The opening scene features some very sensual elements, and the subject of rape is heavily present in the first half of the movie as well. Overall, it is easy to see why this is a R-rated movie. Nevertheless, all of that can be derived from the Parents Guide. What the Parents Guide doesn't necessarily tell you is how impactful this movie is. It requires an additional half an hour after the credits have rolled to really be appreciated and soaked in, and make sure to take that into consideration. One should never put him- or herself in a stressful situation before, during or after watching this. The Shawshank Redemption is brilliant, and treat it as such. Respect its voice over, its mood and atmosphere, and its music! Let it resonate. Enjoy it. My personal grade: a powerful 9/10.

"Many people seem to think Fight Club is a film about guys who join a club and bash the living daylight out of each other. This is simply not the case. Fight Club is a film that questions our society and reality. It is a film with many deep and effective meanings. The Narrator (Edward Norton) plays a wimpish insomniac who is living a boring life, filled with predictable events and no thrills. He is stuck in a dead-end job and the only real motivation for his existence is the will to help people who are dying and to collect furniture. All of this changes when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who shows him that there is more to life than collecting furniture. Tyler seems to be every man's dream as he gets to participate in exciting occupations and events as well as engage in much sexual activity. ""You are not your job, you are not how much money you have in the bank, you are not the contents of your wallet, you are not a beautiful and unique snowflake, it is not until you have lost everything that you are free to do anything."" These are some of the lessons in which Tyler lives by and tries to deliver to Jack and the rest of the world. Overall, Fight Club is an Exceptional movie with an outstanding twist, and although it contains some gruesome violence, it is a movie that MUST be seen by anybody who is tough enough to question their motives and beliefs about existence. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0137523

"This was one of the best films of the 1990's and was all but snubbed by the Academy.  It was nominated for seven Oscars in 1995 including best picture, but it came up empty, trodden under by the Gump stampede. Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's short story was a thing of beauty.  The story of an accountant who thinks his way out of a maximum-security prison, and survives on sheer intelligence, guile and will is expertly spun and engrossing.  The ending is uplifting and exhilarating. Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman gave career performances.  Robbins was outstanding in the portrayal of a character whose phlegmatic and understated persona belied his cunning and razor sharp intellect.  Freeman was also fantastic as the old convict who knew how to get things done in the joint. Freeman's performance got him a Best Actor nomination in a year when Tom Hanks was a cinch. Everything about this film was superlative.  The direction, the cinematography, the sound and the music were all top flight.  It is difficult to comprehend how such an accomplished film was left with so little acclaim. I rated this film a 10/10.

"Why don't they make films like this anymore? This is what movies should be. Sure, they don't have to be this long, but 99% of todays movies are pretty weak compared to this. It's funny actually, I knew this was one of the most famous classics before I saw it. I knew it is considered among the top 10 films almost everywhere. Yet everyone I know has either referred to it as the most boring film in history or never even bothered to finish it. Now that I've seen it I can't help but think, what a pity. Today we are given so much garbage, that when a real film comes along, we are suddenly confused. We don't understand it, we miss the points, and we fail to see the subtext in it. It saddens me that that is what the film business has become, when we fail to see a masterpiece when it comes along. Francis Ford Coppola made a timeless film with the godfather, and he should rank among the top ten, no the top five directors of all time.

"I feel like I should be writing this review in pencil on a sheet of paper considering the subject matter of Captain Fantastic. It challenges social norms, provides thought provoking solutions, and boasts one of the most impressive ensembles of the year. Captain Fantastic gives the 'awakening' story a new setting in what is definitely the most unique film of 2016. Viggo Mortensen doesn't do blockbusters films anymore. I think we all miss his days in Middle Earth, but I consistently find his projects to be fascinating. And there's one thing you can always say about him, he commits. Luckily, he has an entire family worth of committed actors at his fingertips here. Mortensen plays a father of 6, whose view on parenting comes into questioning when his wife kills herself. That's a general premise for Captain Fantastic, but it's far from telling the whole story. It's really a family's adventure to awakening. Although I don't believe there's any way I could live the way the kids do in this film; essentially living in a forest with merely a sharp knife at their behest. There's something to be said about a more simplistic lifestyle and one that involves more learning from print than our screens. I'm no angel when it comes to the overuse of social media or other electronic-related items, but I do enjoy a day outdoors. And really, who's to say that a life without all the technologically advanced items wouldn't be a better life? I loved the way this film tackled these issues. What truly is a sheltered life vs a non- sheltered life really mean? Is it better to be sheltered from the truth or lies told to us to keep us safer? It's no wonder this film is getting recognition for its tremendous cast. This film is built around the cast's strengths. Mortensen and company made sure that this doesn't feel like a movie at all, but a journey you're going on with this family. I think that's one of the greatest compliments a film and its cast can receive, that they feel like real people experiencing real things. It's a truly remarkable tale of a father who's ways of parenting are challenged, and the lengths a family will go to secure what they believe in isn't tarnished by those who believe differently. Aside from some clichéd dialogue in the midst of conflicts, Captain Fantastic is a flawless film. +Refreshingly original +Ensemble cast is great together +Emotional journey of awakening +Social commentary 9.3/10",negative,3,tt3553976

"So I was hyped for this movie from 2013 onward when I saw the first trailer scene of this. It looked promising and I was really stoked on the first person perspective movie since it's something that to the best of my knowledge hasn't been done before. The implementation of it is pretty nice, you sometimes have the weird shot with one eye being ripped out and having a whole different perspective then the other, but even those scenes are pretty neatly made. Now for the plot, it couldn't even be more convenient. It is so convenient that I went out of my way to google synonyms for ""conventient"" just to not make this review consist of a repeating series of the same word. If you don't know what I mean by convenience in that case, here is an example: ""How is the audience supposed to relate to our main character? I know, let's make him silent! But we need an excuse as to why he doesn't talk, any idea? Oh, I know, his speech data just isn't loaded into the system yet and it's conveniently interrupted by the main villain!"" This is a super-cheap shot, but at least they acknowledge it in some shape or form. Now the plot is basically about a guy named Henry, and Henry f*cks sh*t up big time. It's a classic cliché action film, a ton of explosions, big guns, drugs, weirdos and even bigger guns and explosions. The first person ego perspective however makes this a lot more entertaining to watch as it sets a new tone of pace. Usually the pace in action movies is set by MASSIVE amounts of cuts during these scenes, in this however just through the mere fast paced movement of the camera you feel like you are part of the action, a very conducive thing for the directors again. Now the villain was the one REALLY BIG point of criticism that I have for this movie: I get that we are well into the future And I get that we need a villain that is somewhat of a match to Henry's super human strength. But for some weird reason some creative director of this film got super f'ing wasted one night and decided to give this villain some weird power to control gravity as he pleases for I don't know what bloody reason. This basically has ""convenience"" plastered all over it, it yells commodious to the top of it's lungs. ""Oh, Henry is in a situation in which he could easily end the movie before the actual average screen time runs out, but oh no, for some unexplained reason the main villain is bloody god and decides to not get killed"". And why didn't he just kill Henry when he had more than one chance to do so? I mean, he can manipulate gravity, can't he just rip Henry apart? Do his powers suddenly not allow him to tear people apart but move tons of matter through space and time with no effort? But I feel like I need to explain why this bothered me so much: It would have been a WHOLE lot better if the villain was also just a Cyborg like Henry is and that he is simply more trained in combat skill sets. Would have made for less convenience and way less of an epic last scene though. Just to show you what I mean by ""the convenient plot"" without making this a spoiler-review: At one point Henry almost loses his battery-power pretty early in the movie, so he has to hurry to find a backup power. Like how the hell doesn't this scream ""totally fitting for the directors of this movie"" to the top of it's lungs? I immediately thought of Crank 2 when I saw this scene, it is just a writing tool to explain why Henry has to run to meet the next character in a series of characters he meets throughout the movie instead of just strolling through the park or just deciding not to bother with all the killing, fighting and the plot at all. Overall the WAY too convenient plot is complete garbage, it's a 3-4/10 max, there is NO notable difference from any other action movie with opportune action scenes that just come handy for the directors to blow some budget on. But just the idea and the mere problems of making this a movie with ego-perspective shots is a bit more difficult, so for the creativity and the implementation and focus on this feature I'd give it a 7-8/10. This, unfortunately, only averages out in about a 6/10. It's a cool idea and if that is enough for you to endure the most dull plot ever then go for it, but otherwise you should just not bother.",negative,4,tt3072482
"A lot of people measure things on a scale of 1 to 10. A lot of times people will say that something was really good and rate that object in the high 9s. A lot times people will say 10 because the movie appealed to them personally, but others will not think so because it did not do the same to them. Universally, however it is hard to give a movie a 10. But, man, oh man, this takes the cake. If this isn't a 10 I don't know what is. This is a masterpiece. Dude, I mean come on, this film is AMAZING! Not based on favorites, but based on the quality of the film, itself, on every level, how can someone not say that this is overall the best film of all time? Story, acting, cinematography, sales,and universal appeal all work together to make this a great movie. This movie is perfect. Perfect, and no one can say a anything to take that away. Ask anyone on the street who has seen this movie and see if they didn't like it. No one will speak ill of this work of art, no one ( 1 in a 1000 at most).

"The Turning is the latest January horror film to grace the silver screen, and boy is it ever a January horror film.
Now I know the popular thing is to hate on this movie but there are a few redeemable parts of the film, one of which being the cinematography. When this movie actually took a second to breathe the cinematography really shinned through. Another redeeming quality of the film is Brooklyn Prince as the little girl (whatever her name was). She gave easily the best performance in the movie and stole the show in most of her scenes. Now the rest of the movie... well it was a pretty terrible. The first 2 acts of the film is just filled with cheap unearned jump scare scenes one after another and really starts to wear you out. None of the scares really landed and as I said they were rushed and unearned. And the ending, oh boy the ending. I'm not going to spoil it, but it was bad. Very bad it didn't make any sense and it left me feeling empty after the film. There is much more I could go into but that would dive into spoilers so I'll just leave it at that.

So yes, this movie is quit simple, the plot is basic, the actors are ok, but not exceptional but the image that stay in your mind at the end is a message of hope, it shows you that sometimes, in our life, our beliefs are more important than anything else; that we must choose the deepest way to succeed in what we expect to shine, because hope is the last thing to die. 10/10",positive,10,tt0111161

"This is one of those movies that I got used to hearing ""You can see it when your older."" Well, finally saw it and was totally amazed with everything. The direction, th acting, everything. The Acting- The eye candy doesn't get much better than this. (sorry if I come across as shallow)Brad Pitt gives a great performance, being scary, sexy, mysterious and downright awesome with no spots in between. Not to mention he was very, very attractive. Edward Norton, who I couldn't get over at how fast he slimmed down for this gave an unforgettable performance. Everything came off right, the narration, the beating himself up (best part ever). And for last Helena Bonham Carter, her acting was amazing, she was playing such a sleazy character but she did it without overacting at all. The Direction- Perfect, the shots, the small uses of effects everything. The Script- Perfect & logical. With the right mix of seriousness and humor. All in all: 10/10 great movie, good acting, attractive men, fist-fighting. Don't get much better. :) -Hannah S.",positive,10,tt0137523
"I can't believe you Batman fans! I can't believe anyone really liked this movie! It's a total BS film that destroyed the story of Batman. The movie wasn't even that enjoyable, it was brought more into a horror movie than a comic book or even a whimsical/corny TV show. Christain Bale as Batman? He's better than George Clooney, that's for sure, but he didn't give much depth to his character. It's like ""Look! My voice can get scary! I'm Batman! No, really, I am!"". Katie Holmes? I'm recently ticked off with her and Tom, so I'm going to back off and just pretend she wasn't in the movie at all. The villain? Who was it? There was no main one! Plot holes!!!! There were a million. OK, supposedly, this homeless person killed Bruce's parents, NOPE! WRONG! It was Joker, and even before Jack became the Joker, he was a smooth gangster. Not a homeless man if you will. Also, this is supposed to be a prequel to the first Batman? Then why are people using cell phones and updated cars? The first Batman was set in the 80's. Jeez, people!

"I thought Alone in the Dark was awful. Well, it was, but this just surpassed it in terms of ultra-horribility. I know that's not a word but it's all I can summon up to describe the experience that it Doom. Watching Doom is like watching someone play the video game, but without being able to crack jokes or talk to the player about the game. It's filled with characters who are completely unrealistic as marines - and there are references to it being a game from the beginning of the film - from the Rock telling the to get ready to enter the game right down to each of them picking up their guns and gaining a 'handle' The effects were somewhat impressive - I liked the sealing door that shut right onto the attacking monster. BUt that's all it was - a CGI-plated quagmire. The scene where it turns into 1st-person shooter POV was completely contrived - it made no sense and was just there for the sake of being there. As well, there was pretty much zero story - they were thrust into it from the very beginning with no back story or explanation as to what was going on and when they kinda sorta filled us in the details were few and ridiculously dim. Finally, the ending drags on endlessly - just when you think the penultimate fight scene is over, it picks up again until it seemingly ends only to pick up again. And when it DOES end, if you're still awake, it's horridly anti-climactic. My advice: STAY AWAY! Don't even bother renting. Just play the damn game and rent something worth watching. I'd give it a bomb if they'd let me but I'm stuck with the one star. 2/10 (with a 4/10 for effects, if you're still in the theater to see 'em...).",negative,2,tt0419706
"When I found out about Martin Scorsese directing a psychological horror film, I was actually thrilled. But after actually seeing the film in some degree it was actually a bit disappointing. Now if you read the novel this film just isn't going to be as good, so I heavely recommend anyone to see this movie without reading the novel cause it really does rely on the twist and turns although it's fairly predictable. Although the plot wasn't amazing or anything it was a decent movie, the acting was top notch and the cinematography and CGI was very well done. To some it up it's a pretty good noir thriller but nothing very special or anything, especially since the movie relies heavily on the twists and mystery but it just wasn't that great.

"I thought the first one was good but compared to The Dark Knight, Batman Begins is shi*. This movie was excellent, Batman was great and Joker proved a physcotic villain for Gotham City. Scarecrow was only in it for fifteen minuets so I didn't really see the point of putting him in the movie and Harvey Dent played Gotham's White Knight great but I think he became Two-Face a bit late in the movie in my opinion. I thought Joker was THE best villain ever, his jokes mainly consist on hurting/killing people and blowing up buildings. There is some humour with Joker in the movie. Two-Face appeared quite late in the movie but still I was shocked at the way he looked, in the old movies he was just a different colour but in The Dark Knight he was burned flesh and you can see his jaw and bones.

"The Sixth Sense is a 1999 American supernatural psychological thriller film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It stars Bruce Willis as Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist who treats a young boy named Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who can see and communicate with dead people. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $672 million worldwide and becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 1999. It was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay. One of the things that makes The Sixth Sense so special is its unexpected twist ending. Shyamalan carefully plants the seeds for the twist throughout the film, but it's still shocking and satisfying when it's finally revealed. The film is also well-acted, with Willis and Osment giving particularly strong performances. Willis is believable as a child psychologist who is struggling to come to terms with his own personal demons, and Osment is heartbreaking as a young boy who is terrified of the dead people he sees. The Sixth Sense is a truly unique and unforgettable film. It's a must-see for fans of thrillers, horror, and psychological dramas. Even though The Sixth Sense was released over 20 years ago, it still holds up remarkably well. The film's story is timeless, and its twist ending is still shocking and satisfying. The film's themes of grief, loss, and redemption are still relevant today. It is also a reminder that even though we may be gone from the physical world, we are never truly forgotten.

"Sometimes there comes along an excellent, well made, and masterful film that everybody loves, but, for some weird reason, all of the most popular user reviews are negative. Now, I don't mind people expressing their honest opinion, but I don't get some of the user reviews that have been posted, and I ESPECIALLY don't get why there's so many people giving it a 1/10! Sure, you can hate the movie, TOTALLY fine, but a 1/10 star rating is totally unnecessary when you have a film with such lovely animation, and so much hard work and effort clearly put into it! It really bothers me when I go through some of these reviews because I know that animation and filmmaking are extremely hard, and this isn't some lazily animated, 50 minute rip off of ""Kung Fu Panda"" (I'm looking at you, ""The Little Panda Fighter""), this is a pretty well made film. I guess this just proves that opinions are truly powerful things, but, anyway, what about the actual movie! I already said before, it is an extremely well put together animated film, full of great details and the amount of hard work and effort that was clearly put into this production is absolutely amazing! Even if you weren't 100% into the story, characters, etc., it's very well made, at least, just like any other Pixar or Disney animated film. While the concept of seeing the inside of a character's head and watching their emotions react to various things is nothing new and can be seen in various TV shows, movies, etc. (There's even an entire sitcom based around the idea called ""Herman's Head""), this film really expands upon the concept and looks at some of the tiniest details in a really clever and witty way. For example, there's one scene in which we are briefly introduced to two characters whose jobs are to take certain, unimportant memories and make the brain forget about them forever. That is only one example out of many examples of true cleverness behind ""Inside Out"". And the film isn't just fun and games, it has a truly emotional and surprisingly mature side to it that's likely to make plenty of viewers cry. Trust me, ""Inside Out"" goes to some really dark and borderline depressing places! This truly is a masterpiece.",negative,1,tt2096673
"Coco is an animated fantasy film by Disney Pixar. Directed by Lee Unkrich (Toy Story 3), it is a touching story about the importance of family and tradition passed on from generations past. In a small Mexican town, a young boy named Miguel aspires to become a famous musician like the popular actor/singer Ernesto de la Cruz. However, due to a long-running ban on music enforced throughout his family, Miguel keeps his dream a secret from his relatives. On the night before the Day of the Dead festival, Miguel accidentally finds himself transported into the Land of the Dead, where he decides to seek out his great-great grandfather to help him return to the Land of the Living. While not quite as clever and humorous as other works from Pixar, Coco is certainly one of the most heartfelt and charming stories in their film library to date. The film does a fine job of showcasing some intriguing aspects of Mexican culture and family tradition in a quirky but respectful manner. There were several moments that felt highly reminiscent of the Studio Ghibli classic Spirited Away, with its fascinating depiction of the afterlife and the beings who make their home there. The animation, as to be expected, is visually gorgeous to look at and the Land of the Dead felt so vibrant and alive, rather ironically. The voice acting is solid, especially from newcomer Anthony Gonzalez as Miguel, but Benjamin Bratt also shines. These are the types of films Pixar should continue making for audiences and not sequels for the sake of merchandising and money, like the Cars series. I rate it 8.5/10",neutral,5,tt2380307
"""Interstellar,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, is often lauded for its ambitious storytelling and stunning visuals, but it falls short in several key areas due to significant logical flaws, earning it a score of 4/10. One of the most glaring issues is the mission to Miller's planet, which is located near a massive black hole named Gargantua, causing a severe time dilation effect. The decision to land on this planet is highly questionable, as the extreme time dilation results in one hour on the planet equating to seven years on Earth. Despite having lost the signal from the previous landing party, Cooper and his team decide to proceed with the mission. Given the circumstances, it is illogical to consider this planet for colonization, as the severe temporal discrepancy makes it impractical for long-term human habitation and communication with Earth. This plot point undermines the credibility of the mission planning and decision-making processes, suggesting a severe oversight. Furthermore, the visual representation of the black hole, although groundbreaking and visually stunning, is scientifically inaccurate in several aspects. For instance, while the depiction of the accretion disk and the lensing effects around Gargantua are based on scientific models, the film takes artistic liberties that deviate from the actual physics of black holes. These inaccuracies, while enhancing the cinematic experience, detract from the film's commitment to scientific realism. The film also introduces the concept of ""love"" as a quantifiable force that transcends time and space, proposed by Dr. Brand. This notion, although emotionally impactful, feels out of place in a film that otherwise strives for scientific credibility. The thematic dissonance created by this element undermines the film's logical framework. Another significant plot hole involves the sudden, almost miraculous understanding and manipulation of higher-dimensional physics by Cooper and his daughter Murph. These elements are crucial to the plot but are not adequately explained or justified within the film's logic, leading to a sense of deus ex machina that weakens the story's integrity. The narrative suffers from other inconsistencies as well, such as the handling of the ecological crisis on Earth and the portrayal of space travel logistics. These elements, while essential to the plot, lack coherence and detract from the overall plausibility of the story. In conclusion, while ""Interstellar"" offers a visually stunning and emotionally charged narrative, it is riddled with logical flaws and inconsistencies that significantly detract from its impact. The questionable mission planning, scientific inaccuracies, and thematic dissonance make it difficult to fully suspend disbelief. These issues result in a film that, despite its many strengths, ultimately falls short, meriting a rating of 4/10.",negative,4,tt0816692

"Among all the movies I've ever watched, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" stands tall as my all-time favorite. It's not just a movie - it's an emotional journey, a philosophy of life. The funny thing is, when my best friend Sukanto Deb Nath Suvro first recommended it to me, I wasn't that interested. I thought, ""A prison story? How exciting could that really be?"" But the day I finally decided to watch it, I got so immersed that I lost track of time. It felt like I was inside Shawshank prison myself, sitting with Andy and Red, listening to their stories, dreaming of freedom. The most captivating thing about this movie is how it reshapes our understanding of hope and resilience. Andy's character is unbelievably inspiring - it feels like no matter how tough life gets, there's always a way out. That iconic line, ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies,"" isn't just a quote - it's a belief that sticks with you. Another brilliant aspect is the suspense. When Andy's grand escape plan is revealed, it hits you like a storm - ""Oh my God, how did he pull this off?"" That's the genius of the movie - it keeps you hooked till the very last second, leaving you in awe. Honestly, if Sukanto hadn't pushed me to watch it, I might've missed this masterpiece. So I owe him big time for recommending a true cinematic gem. If you haven't watched it yet, don't wait any longer. Once you start, time will fly by, and you'll find yourself lost in an unforgettable journey with Andy and Red.

This movie is one of the best ever. The second in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy the movie is dark and intense while still maintaining a twelve rating so it can be enjoyed by a wide range of audiences.

"There are worse movies out there than Doom, which despite being very bad overall has a few things that stop it from being unwatchable. The photography is more than decent, the film is shot with style and is appropriately claustrophobic in places. Clint Mansell's score does pulsate with energy and generates some tension. Richard Brake gives the best performance in the movie, he actually looked as if he was enjoying himself, while the highlight was the First Person Shooter sequence which was great fun. On the other hand, Doom to me really was as bad as its reputation. Some have said that most of the negative reviews have come from fans of the game disappointed with how Doom adapted it. That is sort of true, and as an adaptation it is easy to see why it disappointed fans, but other negative reviews have come from those who have judged Doom as a standalone and have little knowledge of the game. While Doom is one of those movies that was left wanting on its own terms, it does have far bigger problems than being a naff adaptation of an intriguing and quite compelling game. Starting with listing what's wrong with Doom, obvious starting points would be the script and the story. The script is just horrible, with dialogue so awkwardly corny that it's enough to make the toes curl and some of it sounded like the writers had no idea what they were writing because it made little sense, Rosamund Pike getting the worst of it. Doom's story is paper-thin, to the point that it can be mistaken for not having one at all, and borderline incoherent in places. Not to mention sluggishly paced, especially the first half, and lacking in any kind of originality. The main plot-line of the game, which had a far better premise, is omitted and replaced with one about viruses and mutated monsters, an interesting idea but one where nowhere near enough was done with it, so it all felt underdeveloped and the main reason for why everything wasn't as cohesive. The action is far too dimly lit which made it difficult to follow and was both chaotic and dull, with none of the taut suspense, enthusiasm and intensity that you'd expect. There's a lot of violence, and not only was it overused but it was gratuitous and cheap-looking. Photography aside, the production values while not terrible could have been better. The movie throughout is far too dimly lit, particularly bad in the action sequences, the sets could have been more imaginative and the monsters were disadvantaged by looking like cheap-looking rubber suits and not being on screen for long enough, which diminished any sense of threat they could have had. Doom is flatly directed with little sense of enthusiasm, the characters are cardboard cut-outs(John Grimm/Reaper was the closest to having anything even resembling a back-story and even that was not explored enough and felt overwrought) and the acting is poor. Razzie-nominated Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson gives a flat central performance, Karl Urban scowls his way through his role to the point it was one-dimensional and overdone and the usually dependable Rosamund Pike is by far at her blandest. In conclusion, as an adaptation and as a standalone Doom, while a long from the worst movie ever or one of the worst, was very bad. 3/10 Bethany Cox",negative,3,tt0419706

Solo, however, is a misfire. It's not a bad movie overall, but rather a forgettable one. Pros: Cast Alden Ehrenreich does a good job as Han Solo, he totally fits the role. Emilia Clarke did a good job as Qi'ra. Donald Glover did a fantastic job as Lando Calrissian, and has the best performance among the cast. Woody Harrelson and Paul Bettany are great as Beckett and Dryden, but were totally wasted in this movie (I'll explain later). Jon Faverau did a brief but good job as Rio. Lastly, Thandie Newton did a good job as Val. Plotline The best thing about the story is how the movie is centered around Han Solo and his first adventures with Chewbacca. I love how Han and Chewie first met and their interaction is great to look at. I also love the chemistry between Han and Qi'ra. The interaction between Han and Beckett (Woody Harrelson) is also nice. CGI The CGI is, as always a feast to the eyes, though there are a couple shots that looked unrealistic. Cons: Characters The characters in this movie, however, have little development, as the result I don't really care anyone in this movie (except Lando, he's cool). Han Solo being Han Solo, nothing was added to his personality. Qi'ra is a great character, but greatly underutilized. Lando is great, but like Qi'ra, he could have done so much more. Beckett is... just there, nothing interesting other than he didn't trust anyone. Dryden is a stereotypical 1D villain who's evil, threatening, but no depth. Lastly, L3, played by Phobe Waller-Bridge is not a good droid character. She's super annoying with her ""robot-rights"" rant. Pacing This is where the movie suffers. The movie is so inconsistent with what they're trying to do. On one point is a fun, fast paced heist movie, but later shifts to a slower, more serious movie. The 3rd act really suffers because of this, and it ends up anticlimactic, and boring. At one point I was into it, but then the movie screeched to a halt and I let out a couple of yawns at that point. It's that inconsistent. Story The story didn't add anything new to the Star Wars lore, nor it adds to the main story. So even if you didn't watch this movie you'll be fine. There's nothing to worry about missing a plot detail in the original-prequel trilogies. Action Surprisingly, there's not much action scenes in this movie. But when they do happen, it's pretty fun. The problem is that there's no wow factor in it. There's nothing mind-blowing about it, there's nothing that makes me jump in excitement, it's just fun, but only surface level of fun, with no lasting impact. Overall, I'm pretty disappointed with Solo. It's not a bad movie, it's just very forgettable. I honestly felt that it could be better, it could be fun, but the pacing killed it for me. For casual moviegoers like me, you can watch this movie and have fun with it, but for Star Wars fans, I do feel that you'll be disappointed with this movie. Final Score: 6/10 PS: Also, whoever's working at the Indonesian censorship department that edits this movie should be fired. I mean really? Censoring a kiss?! Twice?!!! And even the cuts were badly edited. Indonesian censorship in a nutshell indeed. -_-",neutral,6,tt3778644
"Like 4400 others I could write now: ""a masterpiece"" and give the film 10/10 stars. But I'd rather tell you that it's exactly these reviews that make me laugh and cry. They rate a film 10 and say it's a masterpiece, but don't even begin to understand what Fight Club is actually about? This film is not about toxic manliness, or rebellion or whatever nonsense. I'll tell you straight up what the misunderstood story in Fight Club is. This is a comment I wrote under a blog ""everybody misunderstands the point in fight club"" in which the blogger himself doesn't understand the point of Fight Club.. The comment that I wrote seems like understandable by some people at least,
so I copy paste it here. HERE IT STARTS:
People don't even understand the main story of Fight Club, because they only analyze parts of the movie. Like overlooking the sinking ship in Titanic, but analyzing the love story between Rose and Jack. The main story in Fight Club is about the process of enlightenment caused by a huge amount of mental suffering. The suffering is a result of identifying with the ego, the things we own and the roles we play in a society of hypocrites. The narrator's subconscious mind creates a hallucination: Tyler Durden. It's a self healing process, a psychosis. The narrator thinks, Tyler is a real person. Tyler shows him, what he needs to change in life in order to find his true self, which will end the suffering: letting go of attachment. Stop identifying with your ego, the things you own. The roles you play in society. It is in the nature of the ego feeling incomplete. Buying new things and a better job makes the ego feel better temporarily, but the feeling of incompleteness will return. All of these are teachings of ZEN Buddhism. Tyler says: ""....never be complete, stop being perfect...."". Be what you really are. Fighting is the meditation/stop thinking aspect. There are countless more hints in the movie for the process of achieving enlightenment: destroying the ego of new project mayhem members. Intentionally losing fights, Tyler and Ed Norton destroy fancy cars with baseball bats, but they stop at the ordinary car, and move on to the next ego-feeding car. Enlightenment is mentioned several times in the movie, for instance the chemical burn scene which teaches: don't run away from suffering, it let us evolve and grow. At the end of the movie the narrator realizes, that Tyler is a hallucination, and shoots himself. Injured, he is telling Marla: ""I am ok, I am really ok, trust me. Everything is gonna be fine"" the injury doesn't matter, because the narrator's suffering has ended. He kills Tyler, because he wants to stop him (himself) from destroying buildings and harm other people. Tyler was his ideal self, but he can't allow him(self) to do that, even if he feels like to do so. Tyler didn't care, because he is created from his subconscious mind, where emotions and beliefs have priority. END OF THE TEXT and I want to add: the rule ""do not talk about FC is, because if everybody would talk about it, the narrator would realize, that there is no Tyler Durden in the real world. Tyler wants to prevent that of course.... Jesus Christ. If you think it is BS what I told you, search google for: Fight Club: An Exploration of Buddhism Charley Reed University of Nebraska at Omaha. And then read the pdf.",positive,10,tt0137523
"I do not know what kind of PR team the production team has hired to promote this film, but obviously they are doing great job as it has already higher score than Inception... Seriously guys??? This film has 5/10 stars at best, and even that for just potential. Rest of it is lost because the film has absolutely no logic to it. Stupid, illogical and at times really boring and long.

"Similar to Rogue One I knew this movie was not a necessary addition to the Star Wars cannon but I knew that as long as it was an enjoyable and unique entry to the franchise I would expect it just fine. But also similar to Rogue One I was very disappointed with the movie I got. Solo himself was the best thing about this movie. With him being a largely supporting character to see him in a new leading role was fun to see and it was very easy o get behind him. Alden plays him very well, obviously not on Harrison Ford's level but he played him as a younger more naive character who feels natural as too his character in the original trilogy. Chewie was also everything I loved about him in the other movies, his meeting with Han was perfect and their chemistry was too notch. I also found the film to be very visually pleasing. Despite having three different directors during production the direction was ultimately just right for what the movie needed. The special effects, as always, were top notch and the cinematography created for a beautiful movie that really took advantage of all the films different locations. The supporting characters were mostly a mixed bag. Woody Harrelson was fine as Beckett but the character was fairly thin seen bland and he didn't really make the character his own. Donald Glover was great as Lando but the character was mainly just there as fan service. I didn't care for Clarke's character in the slightest her romantic chemistry with Han was almost non existent and where he character went was completely predictable. L3 was one of the worst and annoying characters I've seen in a film in years. It's very rare that I actively hope for a character to die but I was cheering for it in every other scene. The pacing was also very poor. The film has some impressive action scenes but they were spaced out between slow building scenes up to the final heist. Since I wasn't invested in the characters, the scenes building them up as characters were largely dull and uninteresting to me. The film was also largely unambitious. As many issues as I have with Rogue One I still think it justified its existence by being completely different from other films in the saga. Solo on the other hand does nothing new. It's a largely bland adventure movie that does nothing new with its narrative and characters. If it was any other franchise than I may be okay with that but since this is Star Wars I expect the movie to be an event and this film was barely memorable. Solo wasn't even really a disappointment seeing as I wasn't already anticipating the film. I was still hoping for the film to surprise me but did nothing particularly remarkable or even memorable. If these spin off films are going to keep happening Disney need to come up with more interesting stories to tell, Ive loved what they've done with the episodic movie so I choose to remain optimistic for the future despite the overall bland experience of this film. 5.5/10 - C+ (Mediocre)",neutral,5,tt3778644
"Most movies/tv shows don't really make me feel or relate to the characters. But this definitely did. They did such a great job with Thanos. He feels more like an actual character while also being the big-bad CGI villain. He is easily the best Marvel villain. Can't say the same about the Black Order though. Some scenes are almost guaranteed to leave you at the edge of your seat, especially the fight scenes. Those were incredible! This is by far my favorite Marvel movie! I give it a 9.5/10!",neutral,5,tt4154756
"I would say I had big expectations not for the fact that this is a Nolan movie nor that main stars are Mcconaughey, Caine and Hathaway but because I really wanted to see a original Sci- Fi. Visuals are stunning.Some of the ideas are brilliant. General story is the same old washed up cliché we've come to expect from well...every movie ever. That one special guy (special also because of some cliché reason) who will save the galaxy and along the way encounter just enough troubles and in the end prevail. One thing I really disliked about the movie is these long dialogs where characters basically sit in a circle trying to sound smart by explaining physics to the viewers. You are constantly getting some physics law shoved down your throat and it seems forced and not convincing.It screams ""We hired experts and famous physicists for this movie goddammit!"". Some character never fully develop and there is a part where Matt Damon appears which does the same clichéd ""necessary obstacle in every movie"" scene. It does not effect the story at all. There is a structure to every Hollywood movie that seems to stay unchanged forever and for some reason it started bothering me quite a bit.There seem to exist certain lines you can expect to hear in every movie over and over again. Sometimes you can anticipate exact words even before the actor says it.I cringed a couple of times watching this movie also.That being said, i loved a part about the black hole near the end (don't want to spoil it) and honestly the movie does have a good pace and never seems to drag even though its 170 minutes long. Too much stuff in the movie gets explained and in the process little is left to the imagination (minus the black hole part which was cool). It is not as subtle,bold and thought provoking as 2001: A Space Odyssey. It expected much more originality from Nolan and although this is not a disaster like Dark Knight Rises it's still inferior to Nolan's past works like Memento,first two Batman movies and even Inception. I'd give this a 7.5/10 and it is more than enough.",neutral,5,tt0816692
"Come on guys! According to the IMDb Top 250 THIS is the second best film EVER!! Better than Citizen Kane? Better than Godfather Part II? Better than ALMOST EVERYTHING?!?! No, it's a very, very long, very, very predictable, very, very cliched, very. very old-fashioned and sentimental film, blessed by some good performers (especially James Whitmore, who, alas, does not figure prominently enough.) It worries me that many of the comments  here seem to think the film artistically transcends the usual Hollywood fare, when in actual fact, it wallows in all the conventions of its genre. I give it 6/10, mainly because I like Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. The only people who could mistake this for a Great Film, would be those who mistake the works of Stephen King for Great Literature.",neutral,6,tt0111161
"Christopher Nolan must be one of the most admired men in the film industry of late. Having been handed a superhero franchise crumbling under its own campiness and trusted with the task of revamping it, adding a firm undercurrent of complexity without sacrificing the inherent enjoyment associated with a man dressing as a bat battling the criminal underworld, Nolan thrived upon the challenge, his Batman Begins providing a new height in the genre and one of the most acclaimed films of the year. And as seemingly impossible as it may have seemed to top his first effort, Nolan appears to have tapped into even more film-making genius, his peerless imagination, courage and unwavering control over every facet of his production making The Dark Knight a seamless, dazzlingly complex sequel to an already essentially flawless first effort - it is near impossible to envision the film being any stronger. Though the film embraces similar themes and plays to all the strengths of the genre, in the end the film proves a 'comic book movie' essentially in name only, as it feels as if Nolan has seamlessly melded several films into one, the tone varying from ultra realistic crime dramas (such as Nolan's inspiration, Michael Mann's Heat) to using the template of the traditional superhero/supervillain conflict as a parable of good, evil and the constant ambiguity and overlap between. In a particularly chilling passage, the Joker disturbingly dissects the effects of Batman and himself on Gotham city and how the friction between ""an unstoppable force and an immovable object"", or Batman's unwavering dedication to justice counterbalancing the Joker's obsession with chaos and disarray simply leads to everlasting conflict. ""I feel like we could do this forever"", the Joker wryly states, and with such chilling, exhilarating and fiendishly complex results, the possibility is mouth-watering indeed. In fact, if one was to extract any form of complaint from such a complex marvel of a film it would be that through the film's consistent breakneck pace and flurry of new plot points and story arcs, the audience is somewhat deprived of the chance to savour some of the film's elements, to take a moment to drink in the all around mastery, from the quiet character moments to the jaw dropping stunts or flooring performances. But there can be little doubt that this is fully Nolan's intent, as The Dark Knight proves an entirely different animal than its predecessor: less about characters (though their development in the simply superb screenplay by Nolan and his brother Jonathan is near flawless) than broad statements, and the lack of quiet, reflective moments simply furthering the chaotic, uncertain feel of the story. However, despite the vast, epic array of content, never does it feel like Nolan has bitten off more than he can chew, but rather than the viewer is challenged to keep up with his immensity of vision. However, those expecting a light-hearted, carefree action romp will find themselves somewhat taken aback, as the film is aptly titled, 'dark' being the operative word. Never before has a comic book film boasted a tone of such crushing realism and devastating, visceral wrenching of emotions. Yet despite the absence of outright bombastic fun, never does the question ""why so serious?"" emerge, as The Dark Knight could never have been anything but, yet never proves overly morose to the point of preventing entertainment. Similarly, those fearing the genre becoming overly cerebral need not fear the action frontier being sacrificed, as Nolan somehow manages to again up the ante on his first effort's already breathless action sequences, providing enough explosions and brief but ferociously intense combat scenes to sate any action enthusiast without sacrificing an ounce of complexity. The sweeping, sumptuous cinematography and soaring score by two of modern cinema's finest composers, Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard completes the sublime package, making for a technically savoury masterpiece. Christian Bale once again gives a remarkable performance, breathing consistently credible life into each of the title character's dual identities, providing a wistful desperation for a Bruce Wayne tantalised by the prospect of abandoning Batman while his alter ego is needed more than ever by his crumbling city. However, despite Bale's powerhouse lead there can be no doubt that the film's primary selling point is the flat out terrifying yet mesmerizing performance by the tragically late Heath Ledger. His anarchistic Joker unquestionably steals the show (no easy feat), flipping between darkly hilarious and chilling while remaining a consistently fascinating and compelling creation - a frighteningly real antagonist for the ages, and easily one of the most visibly unsettling and powerful performances in decades. Aaron Eckhart is similarly superb as Harvey Dent, Gotham's new tenaciously dedicated district attorney, and his inevitable fall from earnest grace is truly affecting, with Eckhart perfectly essaying the shift from charismatic to horrifying. Michael Caine offers a perfect dose of wry humour and inspiration as Wayne's trusted butler Alfred, and Gary Oldman gives a rousingly sympathetic performance as fiercely honest cop Jim Gordon, with Oldman giving one of the most credible heroic performance in recent memory. Morgan Freeman remains pure class as Wayne's CEO and Batman's secret outfitter, and Maggie Gyllenhaal proves a far superior replacement to Katie Holmes, adding a witty spark to an otherwise standard love interest role. Never once patronising its audience, The Dark Knight proves easily the most mature, staggeringly intelligent, insightful, breathless and pitch black comic book adaptation to grace the screen in recent memory, and arguably ever. Indeed, the Joker's declaration of Batman's effect on Gotham's criminals proves prophetic and parallels the effect of the film itself on its medium - there can be little doubt that The Dark Knight has changed the face of what can be expected out of a comic book movie, dispelling critical scorn and rivalling any ""serious film"" in terms of complexity and film-making mastery. Never again will the face of comic book movies be the same - ""there's no going back"". -10/10",positive,10,tt0468569

"In a world where films like The Godfather, 2001 A Space Odyssey, There Will Be Blood, Birdman exist, this above average Steven King adaptation tops the IMDb list and lowers the standards of Hollywood cinema for generations of movie viewers who only have time for what society, manifested in questionable IMDb ratings, deem ""the best films of all time"". While a fantastic film, Shawshank Redemption does not hold a candle to 80% of the Top 100 films in this list. It is an anomaly that it attains such a high score, which is presumably to be the result of initial falsified ratings aggrandized by cinema neophytes who don't know how great movies can be. Snowball effect ensues. There are great aspects to this movie. Morgan Freeman's acting, Roger Deakins' cinematography, Thomas Newman's score. The lead and director were relatively obscure, but they did fine. The story is as average as films of its calibre can get. While it would certainly be a highlight of the legendary year of 1994 (second greatest year in cinema behind 1999), I CANNOT comprehend the notion that it is the best film of all time. It missed out on every critics poll list. This movie ain't that great y'all. Skip this and dig further down into the list if you want the real gems.

"Lucasfilm's return to theaters this summer with its spin-off movie ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" has occurred with fanfare and buzz--although considerably less of both of these metrics than the typical ""Star Wars"" movie. Case in point: there was raucous applause at the Lucasfilm logo and ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..."" title card when I saw ""The Force Awakens"" and ""The Last Jedi"" in theaters, but zero audible reactions during my matinee showing today of ""Solo."" To figure out why this is the case (besides simply ""it's a spin-off,"") one must take a moment and do a bit of introspection. Is it because of the behind-the-scenes nightmares? No, probably not. Mass audiences probably aren't really familiar with that issue. Is it the competition of big blockbusters in the summertime? I don't think so, as big event movies can coexist during these golden, warm-weather months for mainstream moviegoing. Rather, it's likely because of the fact that the film looks rather by-the-book, and it is. That's not to say that audiences won't have some fun while watching ""Solo."" The movie has its share of entertaining action scenes. One key setpiece about a third of the way through the film, a train heist, is superbly shot and executed. It's a pleasure to watch Han spend time with Chewbacca and Lando on the Millenium Falcon. But ultimately, this film will seem more like empty calories than a full meal when it comes to audience satisfaction. It often has a pleasant taste, but you won't feel completely satisfied upon reaching its conclusion. The performances in the film tend to be on the weaker side. Alden Ehrenreich gives a charismatic but rather wooden performance as Han Solo. Some of his inconsistencies in acting technique compared to Harrison Ford can be excused due to the incontrovertible notion that Ehrenreich had incredibly big shoes to fill by playing such a beloved character, but still. Woody Harrelson and Emilia Clarke are both, unfortunately, rather forgettable. The one bright spot in the cast comes from Donald Glover, who does an outstanding job playing Lando. He is able to translate a unique and joyful sense of swagger and style into the role, which enhances the film considerably as a whole. The movie's narrative is also rather bizarre. It manages to be both structurally simple by spending much of its time as a fairly garden-variety ""origin story"" that often plays it too safe. Yet it is also situated at the intersection of intricate complexity in reference to some more contrived plot points throughout the story as well as the film's somewhat convoluted final 25 minutes. Ultimately, ""Solo"" has its enjoyable moments but is still (so to speak) perched on a rather dull bent. It's not a bad film by any means, and it's better than the prequels. But I'm not sure I would recommend seeing it in theaters to audiences that aren't hardcore Star Wars fans. 6/10",neutral,6,tt3778644
"The origin of Batman, heck in my opinion even better than Frank Miller's Batman: Year One. This movie tells the story of Bruce Wayne and how he became Batman. There really isn't much to say about this movie, it's just that good. The acting,the plot, nearly everything was top notch and really true to the comics, Ra's Al Ghul was displayed almost exactly as he is in the comics. I was skeptical with Katie Holmes being the ""bat broad"", but she really nailed her part (although I still think switching her character with Harvey Dent would make a lot more sense continuity wise) I only have 3 minor complaints: 1. The action scenes were chaotic, they wanted to try a new thing and I give the crew kudos for that but it just didn't work 2.Scarecrow should have been...a little bit more mishaped, he's supposed to be weird, he really wasn't that weird as Jonathan Crane. 3. the thing in the end...it doesn't fit in with continuity when you think about the ending of the original Batman movie directed by Tim Burton, but that's just me nitpicking :p I really wanted to give this movie a 9, but I'm not that sold yet, maybe if I went and saw it again...this really is a great movie, I'd give it at least 8.5/10 aaahh F it, I'm gonna give this a 9 anyway",neutral,5,tt0372784

"P. S.: sorry if I will violate the first rule of the Fight Club but I have to talk about this masterpiece. Fight Club is a masterpiece. I think this is the most complicated film to explain and interpret that I have ever seen, perhaps competing with Inception and Memento. The 2 strongest points of this film are the plot, incredible, overwhelming and extremely complicated and interesting, but also its perfect writing by a large hand. Another excellent factor is the actors: Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are colossal and without their perfect performances the film would not be of this high level. In addition, Helena Bonham Carter was also fantastic, even while playing a secondary character. The direction of Fincher is incredible and has wrapped me for the duration and also the photography is stratospheric, fabulous. The special effects are great and realistic, making it as if it really happened. A great strength of the film is the sound: the music is stratospheric, especially that of the final scene, from an overwhelming impact to the scene. I loved the characters, all excellently characterized and thorough. This is a film that must be understood and you have to be very careful about details and dialogues, everything can be fatal to understand. The ending is something fantastic, it leaves you speechless and literally does not make you understand anything. On this film it is impossible to say so much because everything could be subject to spoilers, it is an all connected film that sometimes leaves a fundamental clue. Fight Club is a movie that I loved and I will keep thinking about this movie for so long and I will want to see it again and again and I will wonder as if it was the first time. Just WOW. .

"Well I don't have to spell the last word out, but (!) you get the point (and the double bun ... I mean pun - did it become a triple right now?). Now if those jokes make you laugh, you might be onto something. Unfortunately even in being ""funny"", this misses out on character traits. Why would the boss act like he doesn't like Human Centipede when he is exactly the same character like the one we are seeing in the movies? So while this is a movie within a movie within a movie - it is rather juvenille than clever. The director is a funny bloke and Dieter Laser is channeling him or his reactions to critics of his movies. Whatever the case, he relishes in everything thrown in his way, so me rating this 1/10 makes him happier than if I had gone 4 or 5. You're welcome Mr. Six! A nod to another critic (Ebert with a non score for the first Centipede, not the only movie that did not receive a rating by the way) is also part of the movie. So again, you may find certain things funny (and he is inventive, if rather explicit and vile), but overall this never really does anything other than try to provoke the strongest possible reaction (laughing out loud or feeling the puke running through your veins).

"Does anyone ever asked the question about what is the best movie ever made? The movie that never get wrong in conveying its history and get right on all the points? The film that is very close to the word ""perfection""? Well, ""The Godfather"" parts 1-2-3 are undoubtedly the answer to this question. Separate the 3 movies and judge them separately is easy. Of course the 1st is where we get marveled, and the other two we had already noted some mistakes, but that's why the three movies together are not only a masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola but also (perhaps) the best story ever told in a movie. While in the 1st part, we are introduced to the Italian mob-family the Corleone's facing various threats from rival mob-families. That forces Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) tries to push his youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), to be his successor and be the next family's godfather; In part 2, we have the exact continuation of the story of Michael in the power of the family trying to raise the family business to other countries but he ends up making mistakes along the way. And simultaneously, we have the story of the young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) showing how he came to America and started raising his family; And finally the 3rd and last part we see a older Michael Corleone, suffering from mistakes that he committed in the past. But now he tries to redeem himself before his children Anthony (Franc D' Ambrosio) and Mary (Sofia Coppola) and his family trying to finally legalize the family business going into business with the Vatican and elect his nephew Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) as the new family godfather. But the dangers have always followed the Corleone's closely. As I said, all parts form the masterpiece that Mario Puzo (Screenwriter) and Francis Ford Coppola (director and screenwriter) brought to the world with his vision of the Italian mafia. Many criticize the film by worshiping the Italian Mafia, which it technically does, but the way that both genius explore it is fantastic. Throughout the history of the Corleone's, Coppola and Puzo explore the life and business of the mafia and how it works, demonstrating the business and the wars between the Mafia families that are shown realistically and terrifying. BUT, it is not just a story of violence and tragedy as many accuse (which is 60 % of it), because as the film progress it raises throughout the history various concepts of honor, justice and family, all revolving around the Corleone. Making the public really feel part of the family and start to worry about each family member in all parts of the story, at the same time with the family business and his honor. The writing from Puzo and Coppola help much in this regard. The script is extremely ""perfect"" in all parts. The narrative is so superb that it never gets boring or leave loose ends, and always raise the values of honor and family through the best dialogs ever put on film. But Puzo and Coppola can make these long dialogs in simple conversations between human beings facing their problems, putting ourselves in their situations and relating with them, leaving the film more exciting and engaging. But Coppola not only explores the Italian mafia and their families but also puts at various points in American history: the first part is right after the 2nd World War and Michael is a war hero returning home, but he ends up becoming the godfather from his family; on the 2nd part in the history of young Vito Corleone we see him coming in America at the time of the great Italian immigration meeting the ""American Dream""; on the 3rd part with Michael going into business with the Vatican we see a huge line of corruption and murder within the church . Both in writing and directing the film is excellent too but the performances are the highlights of the movie: Al Pacino is excellent in every detail with a penetrating gaze and frightening expressions (and still annoys me that in 3 films he didn't get a Oscar for his role); Robert De Niro is a perfect young Vito Corleone in both voice and gestures reminding us of the badass and unforgettable old man from the first part with a simply perfect performance from Marlon Brando. Many say that the 3rd part should never be connected to the first two for be to horrible. I think the film is still a masterpiece but obviously it has his inconveniences leaving loose ends like: what happened with Tom (Robert Duvall), the family's lawyer, he died or he started his own family as he wanted in part 2? And also adds a lot of plots and little development, at least in the 1st hour of the film. But after a huge chopper scene everything settles superbly and concludes the trilogy or rather the film perfectly. Simply putted is the best movie ever made, the drawbacks and inconveniences are almost invisible (except in the 3rd part). Concepts of honor and family within the Mafia; full of suspense and drama; criticizes America and the church. All this in a movie with excellent performances, direction and writing simply perfect. All that makes ""The Godfather"", the strongest brand of cinema till today 10/10",positive,10,tt0068646
"This film had been on my to-watch list for some time now and I had decided to (more ended up) watching it. I was expecting a lot considering its 8.8/10 rating on IMDb. Unfortunately I did not enjoy it. Im going to agree with Roger Ebert on this film and say it was trying to be like Seven or Usual Suspects with its dramatic twist, which I unfortunately guessed half way through (it wasn't hard) which took some of the film away from me. Also it had this feel to it like a poor mans film. A film for thick people. I can see massive jock idiots coming from that film saying ""I LOVED THE BIT WHERE HE HIT HIM WITH HIS FIST DURRRRRR"" ""OH YER MAN AND THE TWIST DUDE, WE ARE SO INTULEKTUCAL WATCHING THAT FILM"" (not to say if you like this film your an idiot) The violence is almost pornographic like the saw films are with the horror and the ""meaning"" of the film seems to be violence will help solve the world. Though it has its bad points it has some good. the acting isn't bad and some of the cinematography is excellent, especially in the first half. Also the first part of the film with the narrative and the flip in order of the storyline is good. All in all the start is great but a faltering end and the overall feel of the film is not good. 5/10",positive,8,tt0137523
"I just returned from viewing The Dark Knight with my sister and her German boyfriend. Quite frankly, this movie was absolutely enticing and exhilarating to watch. The acting was amazing by all the actors involved and Heath Ledger did indeed, earn his own posthumous Oscar. The storyline was not straightforward like Batman Begins, but left the audience behind and made us catch up with the plot. When the film ended, every person in the theater gave it an ovation and screamed with appreciation. This is very unusual, especially in my own town which is not in the center of the media-fed United States. This review is not meant for spoilers, but to tell what type of attention it will garner. If you are into light and happy tales, then Batman Forever and Batman and Robin are the films for you! If you are into serious and exhilarating superhero films, then this will be you magnum opus. 10/10 from me!",positive,10,tt0468569
"I hear middle-aged men spout their outdated, biased wisdom all the time. ""Modern horror movies are just gory, not scary. The old movies, boy, now those were scary because you didn't always see the monster. If you want scary go watch . . ."" And they always finish their statement with whichever popular 70s horror film they first watched in their pre-teens and peed their pants over. To them, there could never be anything scarier because that movie is so ground into their psyche. To the modern viewer, there could never be anything funnier because we've matured and realized the real world is infinitely more terrifying than creaky staircases. I view old horror movies in the same way I view cartoons. They're so over-the-top and ridicules that it's impossible to take them seriously, but they have some entertainment value when you have nothing better to do. There are a handful of exceptions to that last sentenceAlien ('79), The Shining ('80), Black Christmas ('74)but for the most part, it's a fairly realistic view. While I hoped The Open could have been one of the few exceptions, it isn't. Doesn't even come close. I have a lot of appreciation for the slow opening that builds emotional impact and atmosphere. However, it seems that I can count the films that actually pulled off that style without just adding pointless scenes for the sake of pointless scenes on one hand. In The Omen, the slow build not only adds a lot of pointless scenesrunning animals, OH MY!but it makes the viewer fail to see the difference between this and a Lifetime move. The slow build never once emphasizes the imminent doom hanging over the family's heads; it just pumps the movie full of boredom and cheese. Unless you're frightened by running animals and a kid riding his tricycle, there is nothing subtly frightening here. And the slow build takes up 3/4ths of the entire movie. I'll give The Omen credit for having one well-done abrupt moment of shock near the beginning, but after that it goes back to cliché drama. Horror directors/writers have a false idea that if they immerse you in the daily life of the characters, you'll care about them when they're killed or are nearly killed. The reason that is untrue is because all the characters in The Omen are all flat clichés. Who would have guessed the husband doesn't believe in the supernatural, then by the end is converted into believing the absurd storyline? Who would have guessed the wife is a spineless women who just whines and acts dumb in every scene she has? Drama doesn't build an attachment to characters. It didn't in 1970, it doesn't today. What builds an emotional attachment to characters is characters that actually have CHARACTER. Characters that actually have a personality and aren't just walking horror clichés with legs. The other problem with The Omen is the absurdity of it all. A man's adopted son is really the antichristthat I can take seriously. Everyone associated with the antichrist is marked with sacrilegious symbols and must be contended with in religious waysthat's just stupid. Being someone with a theological background, the stupidity of religious horror movies always makes me laugh. Instead of actually following scripture and creating a genuinely terrifying experience, there always has to be retarded gobbledygook thrown in to cheese everything up. Instead of accurately portraying a realistic Christian or non-Christian, every last person in these religious horror films have to be a religious extremist of a die-hard atheist. There is just no realism. People site The Omen as one of the movies that subtly frightens you to the point of terror, but that simply isn't true. The Omen bashes you over the head with cheesy, over-the-top Hollywood conventions. I find it ironic: modern horror films bash you with gore and it's not scary; older horror films bash you with cheese and it's REALLY not scary. When I wasn't bored, I was laughing. The Omen isn't a perfectly terrible movie, though. The directing is solid. The slow-mo close-ups of predictable plot points, however, got really stupid really fast. The acting from everyone but the wife is very solid. The wife is possibly the most over-the-top whiney female in any 70s horror film, period. The entire movie carries a very classic feel that most 70s horror movies carry, and that adds some entertainment value. The actual story, if they were to have taken out the gobbledygook, is fairly solid and interesting, even if it isn't anything new or original. And that's all the good I can say. As I said, I appreciate a lot of what made parts of The Omen a solid movie and gained it its classic status. That doesn't mean I can take it seriously, because I can't. It's too ridiculous and pumped with too much cheese. When I think of true terror, I most often think of something realistic. People say ""torture porn"" and gore isn't scary, but it hits far more raw nerves with me and other horror fans because it's something that could really happen. It's not campy or fun. It's real. It's disturbing. Isn't that what true horror is supposed to be? That doesn't mean I hate old horror movies. Straw Dogs ('71) was the forerunner for Saw ('04). Just because something's old doesn't mean it's good, and just because something's new doesn't mean it's bad. And vice versa. But it's impossible for me to give a high score to The Omen. A lot of my older horror movie reviews spark responses that absentmindedly claim: ""You're not a true horror fan because you didn't like this. Go review comedies."" To which I respond: I thought I was. 1/10",negative,1,tt0075005

"Story Summary: we follow a clown mr Bean like character, train wrecking his way through life, this surprisingly still leads to him meeting his future wife who becomes the mother of his son. The second part takes place around the 40s, in it, the clown (now a father) softens the reality of the world that he and his son live in.. NOTE: During the review there is mention of three sections:
PART I (first 50min)
PART II (second part of the movie starts exactly after the 1ST hour). Intersection (10min between PART 1 & PART 2) Analysis:
It's great how the movies resonates well with such a huge crowd, because the intro is very average. The approach of the WWII here takes a comedic approach. Which is original and what makes it iconic to many today. But by having a clown acting like a fool, it doesn't make it relatable and sometimes painful to watch in the first part of the movie. The first 50min are amongst the worst I ever had to sit through. The movie uses the first PART to introduce the main character and his love interest, It tried to be funny, but it's boring and unrealistic. After that there is the middle part of 15min, where basically the time is fastforwarded and a boy is introduced who is the son of the main character. It's a filler section with a better pace then the long first part. The second part is where the movie actually seems to starts and it is MUCH better. Whilst unrealistic, it's does have heart. This all seems very unlikely to have never taken place though with certain scenes. So it is kind of a fairytale. The best part about the movie is the ending. Which redeems the whole movie in all fairness. Dialogue 4/10: cringe, unrealistic, one good quality are the few riddles that have been added to the storyline. Acting 5/10: childish, slapstick acting that would have looked great in a 60s Looney Tunes cartoon. The second part improves, but the main character is a joker type... so it's part of the identity of the movie. Decors/costumes/other visuals: 7/10: it looks well done for it's time, so stand outs bad or good. Music 8/10: the theme song is iconic and gives a nostalgic feeling Other comments: the hiccups of one of the character were a mess. Summary: comedy is very personal, and whist this got huge critical acclaim, one wouldn't be blamed to not take the movie serious. And whilst taking a original take on a serious topic it's still one of the weakest IMD top 100 movies. But If you get through the first 49 minutes the film improves significantly.",negative,4,tt0118799
"I thought the load of rings (or whatever) was the biggest load of rubbish i've ever seen, I could have pulled a better film out of any number of orifices. It's so boring, and long, and... It's useless. The Lord of the Rings is fantastic. As a fan of the books, I couldn't help but be gobsmacked at every turn by how much Jackson's vision had turned out so much like the images of middle-earth in my head. I know everyone's already said nearly everything that can be said about the imagery of the film, but it was the music in particular, which I thought was outstanding. A definite oscar contender. From the perfectly-judged rustic tootlings in the shire, to the glorious, stirring fanfare that greets the fellowship during, you know, that fantastic bit where they do that slow-motion shot with them walking up to the camera. (Which, in any other film would be deplorably self-congratulatory, but through Jackson's sheer directional skill, seems perfectly justified here.) To the genuinely heart-rending single, beautiful voice that mourns the fall of Gandalf. (I tell you, I really had to console myself .... I mean my sister, who was in floods of tears). It would have been so easy for Howard Shore to go the way of John Williams, (something I am profoundly thankful he DIDN'T do!) and seriously serious kudos have to go to the New Zealand orchestra, who did a great job of all those musical bits. Having seen the film more times than I feel comfortable talking about socially, I cannot say 'best film ever', but after all, who can? It's stupid to try and bring order to things like this. Let's all just sit back and enjoy the power of a brilliantly made film, and as fantastic a book adaption as anyone could hope for. 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0120737

"The first rule about Fight Club is ""you don't talk about Fight Club."" Guess I have to break that rule. In this Fincher classic based on the Chuck Palahniuk novel of the same name the viewer accompanies the nameless protagonist on a spectacular journey. This is my favorite movie of all time, and I don't have much to criticize about. This is a movie everybody should have seen. Let me tell you why. At the beginning of the film the Narrator works a car company and has insomnia. A chain of events leads to the introduction of Tyler Durden, a soap producer and bohemian. Together the two start a fight club. Men participate for different reasons; the Narrator does this to be able to sleep, Tyler, to upset the basic societal structure. I don't want to tell more about the story. It's a thrilling experience everyone has to take in on his own. The story is absolutely mind blowing and fascinating. Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors of modern time, and while his performance in American History X certainly competes with the one as the Narrator here, I think this is his best performance to date, because you can really sympathize with him. Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter both play very extravagant, crazy characters. They both play these characters very well, especially Pitt's Tyler Durden is one of the most iconic movie characters of the 90's if not even movie history. Jared Leto (Angeleyes), Meat Loaf (Bob) and Zach Greiner (The Narrator's Boss) also contribute to the quality of this movie. Some critics say the message of Fight Club is pure anarchy. I say it goes a lot deeper, but I can't say how without spoiling it. Fight Club also has a special look. Most of the film is dark, either due to night or weak lighting. This works in harmony with the overall dark tone of the plot. Single scenes also have there uniqueness due to cool dialog, memorable quotes and some very dark humor. The soundtrack is composed by the Dust Brothers and consists mainly of electronic music. Personally, not my type of music, but it fits the film and I quite enjoy the tracks ""Stealing Fat"" and ""Jack's Smirking Revenge"". And, off course, there is ""Where is my Mind"", performed by the Pixies. I love the song very much. The song ""Going Out West"" by Tom Waits is almost just as awesome. So, Fight Club is a film with gripping story, interesting characters, quotable dialog, amazing acting performances, unique style, a political message, humor and fitting soundtrack. in short: the perfect movie. 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523
"The Godfather has great scenes, classic characters, classic dialogue, and an amusing look into the Italian mafioso, but it's just a tad bit too long to be perfect, in my opinion as a new viewer. There were many scenes that were riveting and performances that were, at times, mesmerizing, but I just feel like it is a little overrated. It deserves its due credit, no doubt, for without it, so many great movies and tv shows inspired by it would have never been made, and the ground it therefore broke will always hold its place as one of the greatest movies ever made. Some scenes were just too drawn out, lengthened, or long-winded, and it can therefore become a little bit of a chore to watch and enjoy in one sitting, as good as it can be at certain points. I can see how when this came out in 1974, it was so popular and how it held up throughout the years to be considered one of the best movies ever made, but in my experience in watching other movies since then of this genre, I can list at least 5 I enjoy at least just as much if not more. Obviously, those films have been inspired by the Godfather so without it they wouldn't likely exist in the fashion that they do, but they are still better paced, more suspenseful at times, and just more entertaining overall. This doesn't mean that the Godfather isn't a classic and one of the best, but it is a matter of taste, and the Godfather still remains a movie I have to really be in the mood for to sit through. Certain scenes, or parts, of this epic hold up much more than others, while other parts and scenes can feel like a slog to sit through. 8/10",positive,8,tt0068646

"The Godfather (1972), directed by Francis Ford Coppola and adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, is not just a crime story; it is a profound exploration of power, loyalty, family bonds, and the complexity of human nature. Every scene, dialogue, and silence is meticulously crafted, providing the viewer with both a visual and emotional masterpiece. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone represents authority and wisdom. His leadership is defined not by shouting or force, but by listening, measuring, and acting strategically. From the opening wedding scene, every gesture, glance, and conversation illuminates the characters' world and conveys the weight of Vito's responsibility. Modern cinema rarely achieves this level of intensity and realism. Michael Corleone's transformation forms the other core of the film. Initially passive and withdrawn, Michael becomes a cold, strategic, and decisive leader as the story unfolds. Al Pacino's performance masterfully conveys his internal evolution through subtle expressions and controlled silence. This process demonstrates the psychological impact of power and responsibility with striking clarity. The cinematography is exceptional. Gordon Willis' use of darkness and shadow highlights the moral and ethical complexities of the characters. The dimly lit interiors and amber tones create both an aesthetic and thematic resonance, evoking a sense of power, mystery, and danger. The film strikes a remarkable balance between realism and theatricality. While some scenes highlight the actors' performance style, this actually enriches the film, reminding the viewer that cinema is an art form blending narrative authenticity with expressive craft. The performances and attention to detail draw the audience deep into the story while reflecting the tension between human emotion and strategy. The limited presence of women focuses the story on the male-dominated world of power, yet it intensifies themes of loyalty, honor, and family responsibility. Every detail reinforces the heavy burden of family ties and leadership. The film's deliberate pacing enhances its storytelling. Every line of dialogue and every scene is fully developed, giving viewers the opportunity to analyze character motivations, strategies, and internal conflicts. Even contemporary films struggle to offer such a deep and cohesive narrative. The closing scene, with Michael shutting the door, symbolizes not only the consolidation of power but also the complexity of human nature, the weight of loyalty, and the consequences of betrayal. The Godfather explores themes of power and family at their deepest level, leaving a lasting impact on the audience. --- Category Ratings and Explanations Epic: 10/10
The Godfather is an undisputed epic of cinema. The story spans generations, exploring the lives, relationships, and power struggles of its characters in profound detail. Its epic scope is reinforced not only through the plot but through psychological depth and character interactions. Gangster: 10/10
The film sets the gold standard for gangster cinema. Every strategic and violent action of Vito and Michael Corleone is depicted with realism and attention to detail. Crime scenes are used to develop character and explore moral dilemmas, not merely for action. Tragedy: 10/10
The tragedy of the Corleone family is both personal and familial. Vito's death, Michael's internal struggle, and themes of betrayal and loss are portrayed gradually and powerfully. The weight of consequences and the cost of power is felt deeply, making the tragic elements resonate. Crime: 10/10
Crime is depicted both structurally and psychologically. Strategic moves, revenge, and control struggles reveal not just the surface of the criminal world but its depth. Every act of crime serves to highlight character psychology and familial loyalty. Crime is central but never merely sensationalized. Drama: 10/10
Drama drives the story through character interactions. Family ties, power struggles, betrayal, loyalty, and ethical dilemmas create a compelling dramatic structure. The internal conflicts of Michael and Vito, combined with dialogue, staging, and silence, maximize the dramatic impact. --- 💎 Overall Rating: 10/10
The Godfather is a flawless masterpiece of storytelling, character depth, cinematography, and thematic richness. Every scene, line, and silence contributes to a legendary cinematic experience, establishing it as timeless and unmatched.",positive,10,tt0068646
"OK, so it's trash. I mean ""Showgirls"" is complete and utter trash. But it's artful trash, and therefore it is not a total waste of celluloid. ""Showgirls"" was Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven's fourth American film, his first being ""RoboCop"" (1987) and was followed by ""Total Recall"" in 1990 and 1992's ""Basic Instinct."" It has been said that with the release of 1995's ""Showgirls,"" director Paul Verhoeven and writer Joe Eszterhas were attempting to start a movement in Hollywood that would include the release of many ""NC-17""-rated pictures; ""Showgirls"" was the first. Unfortunately, as with some brilliant marketing ploys, the plan backfired and ""Showgirls"" was awarded the Razzie for worst picture of the decade; an honor I (as well as many others) feel was warranted. Sure, it's almost non-stop and excessive skin and f*****g on screen for two hours. Verhoeven is bringing his unique European touch to ""Showgirls,"" which I feel is an element most of my fellow American moviegoers did not pick up back in that turbulent year of 1995.

"I Saw The Devil (2010) :
Brief Review - A monstrous psycho-killer thriller with the equally diabolical and matured revenge. I Saw The Devil is much better revenge drama than a thriller. It doesn't have much suspense to be called a good thriller but as a revenge drama it has much more in kitty than any other film of that genre. It's difficult to mange both the things Thrill and Revenge, somehow it's like a miracle which only happens once. That happened with 'OldBoy' (2003) and then there's nothing left for other thrillers to match the level. I Saw The Devil is a brutal revenge drama with that Korean realism which includes lots of blood-shed, violence, sexual material and unbearable cruelty. But additional element here is, it's not just about monstrous villian but it also provides the equally devilish properties to the main Hero who is hunting for the equally brutal revenge. The film is about a secret agent who exacts revenge on a serial killer through a series of captures and releases after the brutal murder of his beloved wife. Bollywood made 'Ek Villain' on the same story but failed to match the maturity and brutality so it was nothing but a fairly decent film. I Saw The Devil is 20 minutes longer than what it should have been. But thankfully it doesn't bore you with regular scenes. It has gripping screenplay and plenty of action to keep you hooked for 140 minutes. Coming to the acting departement, the pair of Lee Byung-hun and Choi Min-sik is absolutely brilliant. Forget rest of the cast, these two are treat to watch. You will remember this hero vs villain face-off for some time. Director Kim Jee-woon has done an amazing job as he kept the brutality intact with lots of entertainment, unseen psychosis and emotional connect. Overall, little less as a thriller but overwhelming as a revenge drama. RATING - 7.5/10* By - #samthebestest.",neutral,5,tt1588170
"While commenting on this movie is truly a case of ""flogging the dead horse"", i still feel that i have to. This is just so unbelievably bad that i can't understand what happened really. There might not have been premises for a classic here, but at least they should have been able to make it a tolerable movie. This is the touching story of stripper slash prostitute Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley) who comes to Las Vegas seeking fame and fortune. She starts out dancing at a seedy joint, but through luck and some dirty moves she gets the opportunity to become a real showgirl! Soon though it becomes apparent that life as a showgirl is not as glamorous as Nomi had hoped... This movie sets the tone right from the beginning. From the inbred retard that Nomi hitches a ride with to Vegas, to her completely unwarranted emotional outbreaks this is a ride into the mouth of madness. I can only guess what script-writer Joe Eszterhas and director Paul Verhoeven were thinking, but i'm not sure i WANT to guess. Because like someone pointed out, this is most likely a movie based on Joe Eszterhas highly secret list that he keeps under his pillow: ""100 things i would do if i was a woman for a day"". And most of those things involve touching, displaying, fondling, talking about and otherwise handling breasts. Acting here is non-existent. Elizabeth Berkley makes a career-crashing performance in the lead, making her character into an emotional train-wreck lashing out at the most unexpected times. Gina Gershon is suitably sleazy as Cristal Connors, the queen of showgirls. Kyle MacLachlan should receive an award for strangest hairdo, but also deserves notice for his complete inability to act casual. It feels to me that even though director Verhoeven seemed to be completely oblivious as to how deep this movie was plunging, maybe the actors had some idea. Most of them are just plain awful, even actors that are usually at least acceptable. And why should they try? Lifting the paycheck, going home and hope nobody watches the movie was probably all they could do. The truth is that it would be easy to go on for literally days listing all the flaws in this movie. But there is no real point. This is a movie that has to be experienced. One of those marathons of crap that are so bad they turn into instant classics. So while the quality is on zero kelvin levels, the entertainment value is rather high. I would however recommend high levels of alcohol for this to be truly enjoyable. I rate this 1/10 for quality, 8/10 for entertainment and 10/10 for electroshock-inspired sex scenes.",negative,1,tt0114436
"Fight Club is an American film directed by David Fincher. It is based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter are perfectly cast as the three lead characters. Narrator(Edward Norton) is an unnamed ordinary guy who works for an insurance company. He makes a decent salary, he can afford every material good the heart could desire, but the man is deeply depressed and develops insomnia. The Narrator starts attending self-help groups to relish in not being as miserable as the people in these groups and meets another 'fake' named Marla Singer(Helena Bonham Carter). His life changes when he meets a soap salesman Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt). Tyler Durden being a rebel and an anarchist convinces The Narrator into staging impromptu boxing matches in parking lots. Then Tyler and The Narrator realize that they love fighting because it makes them feel alive and ""real."" After that Durden decided to start fight clubs across the country; and eventually turns the clubs into aggressive criminals releasing their hatred on corporate America. Everything is amazing about this film: the gripping plot, the acting, the soundtrack, the plot twist. I wanna talk more details but we all know rule #1. My only criticism would be that I can't erase my memory and watch it for the first time again. Not only is this a complex and absolutely thrilling film, but also it's thought-provoking and tackles some seriously deep issues, such as social pressure, consumer culture and radicalization.

"I'm not the biggest Shyamalan fan by any means. Of his entire body of work, only The Village and Unbreakable really stand out when originality is concerned, and they're really the only two of his movies that I've enjoyed. The major problem with The Sixth Sense is, who would have guessed, unoriginality. There is nothingminus the plot twist, I guessthat makes this stand apart from the thousands of other kid-seeing-ghosts movies that came out before it. If you've consider yourself a horror fan, and one that has seen a good selection of ghost movies, you know everything that happens here. And I mean everything. However, there is some good. Mainly being that The Sixth Sense was one of the few groundbreaking American horror filmsand yes, it is drama/horror, not a thrillerthat brought some weight to the genre. While the majority of horror films in the '90s just focused on cheesy scares, Shyamalan focused on fine detailed, believable, high-quality scares that made the genre cinematic and not just laughable. With that said, The Sixth Sense, like most horror movies, just isn't very scary. A lot like the original Saw was a thriller set in a horror universe, The Sixth Sense is a drama set in a horror universe. That brings out a lot of problems, however. For one, The Sixth Sense follows the same cliché formula a lot of Stephen King novels do: heavy doses of drama, with short bursts of horror scattered throughout. That just makes the already deeply unoriginal movie feel even worse because it makes it very boring. The attention to detail I mentioned above as a complement is also a major complaint. Shyamalan's directing/writing skills are both probably both at their best here on a technical level (if you ignore the unoriginality). There wasn't a single shot in the movie that wasn't effectively done, and the plot is laid out well. The plot twist ending brought the plot twist ending into the mainstream, and it's very well done, but still a little cliché. The plot twist has been used in a lot of urban legends before, as well, if I remember right, on The Twilight Zone a few times. So, in the end, it just left me with mixed feelings. On one hand I want to praise the movie for being so well done, but on the other hand I want to trash it for the lack of anything that sets it overall apart from every other ghost story out there. Everything was so predictable. Let this be a lesson to all of you who say a movie can be a good movie even if it's unoriginal: you're wrong. Without originality, you're just left with no mystery, and just left feeling: ""Eh, whatever. Didn't I see that before somewhere?"" And that last thought is exactly my final opinion on the insanely overrated The Sixth Sense. But at least it wasn't as godawful as The Happening, right? 1/10",negative,1,tt0167404
I first expected from this movie to be massively overrated but after I watched I was amazed. In my opinion is the third best movie ever made. It has action and you can't get bored while watching it. It's a three hours long movie but not a single minute was boring. This is definitely the best movie about gangsters and I loved the action. I also liked the fact that this movie is not all about gunshots and stuff like this. It shows us the problems that the Corleone family has to deal with and I was just amazed by the plot. It could be a little bit shorter because some scenes are unnecessary in my opinion but as I said it is definitely not boring. It gets a 10/10.,positive,10,tt0068646
"From the moment the credits were on screen I instantly fell in love with it. Fight Club has changed our lives and the way we look at it. You will see this near the top of peoples lists. That is because people think that this film is correct. Its up to you to decide. Or it could be because it is insanely cool, which it certainly is. Though it is not right to call it Fincher's. As the film is adapted from Chuck Palahniuk's book which I must add is just as great. This is Chuck's masterpiece. The main difference is the endings, Chuck's is a book ending and David's is a film ending. Making both perfect. The film has 3 parts to it, studying the character in which called the Narrator played by Edward Norton. The first part follows him trying to cure himself from insomnia. He finally finds a way to sleep. Crying in self help clubs. To completely lose yourself. He became addicted. And joined all of them. We lose track of time. And all of this becomes a routine. His boring job. Non-stop buying from Ikea, as it makes him feel complete. Going to self help clubs. Cancer. Parasites. All kinds of diseases he said he has. Although he doesn't have to say anything at all. But then, at the very moment, just when he had become comfortable, she ruined everything. She is Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). She is also a faker. With her in the picture our narrator couldn't sleep. He then escapes it all by travelling in his job and spends most of his time on planes flying around America. Then he finds a man called Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap salesman he met on a plane. This then leads the second part. Then Narrator comes to his condo to find it on the ground. Everywhere. Smashed to smithereens. He then calls Tyler to talk about this to. This leads to him staying at Tyler's place but first he must do him a favour; one of the greatest lines in film history. 'I want you to hit me as hard as you can'. Fight Club is born. 8 simple rules for men to fight. To be born again. Soon a lot of men join. Tyler's place is a complete mess. The house looks like its about to fall down at any moment. The Narrator still goes to his job, face full of bruises. He no longer needs the self help clubs. Fight Club grows and Tyler decides to expand it. Just when Marla comes back into his life. Fight Club in itself becomes a cult, a new religion. Then homework comes into action. In which the men of Fight Club go out onto the streets and cause mischief. Which leads the mayhem. Project Mayhem. The third part. The adrenalin starts pumping. But I'm going to let you find that out for yourself. The Narrator guides us through the film telling us his theories and his feelings in metaphors. He is one of the greatest characters of all-time for his one-liners. Not because they are funny. But because they are influential. I guarantee a fan of Fight Club will have those words running through their mind. Tyler Durden also has theories. Yet he does not tell us. He tells the Narrator. We hear. And we believe. Somehow the viewers believe Tyler. He speaks in such a mature way with evidence. His theories are on humanity and manhood. He believes that we are loosing the plot, the original plan for the human race. And the way to get better, is to start again. Marla invades The Narrators life as she feels incomplete too. The depth of the film is incredible and occasionally unrecognized. It's about becoming a man. A real man. The hunter man. The man who will kill. Fighting is just practice. When they take a swing to another man in fight club they are going back to their roots. Not personal roots exactly, but general roots of the gender. It's not pointless violence. It's meaningful. This is why teenage boys love the film so much, not because its cool, but because they can relate to it as they go through puberty. If I were to explain another depth to the film it would be a spoiler so I am going to let you find out for yourself... The cinematography is amazing. The screenplay makes it enjoyable every time and never get old; this means you will soon know all the lines. I love the score, it fits so well. The gritty atmosphere and dark humour make this re-watchable and keeps you watching. The acting is brilliant, and I must say cool. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing these parts. Pitt plays the performance of a life-time, he will always be remembered for Tyler Durden. This has already become a cult classic and a favourite by many. I recommend you join the club if you haven't seen it already, as you will probably not be able to resist. It doesn't get any better than this. 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523
"I really liked it as a kid, but I saw it again after 5 years or so, and it doesn't wow me as much. It isn't a terrible film, but it isn't a great one either. I will confess I haven't seen the show, so I can't judge whether Rocky and Bullwinkle were out of character, though I did read somewhere, that the voice of Bullwinkle was not the same as the one in the show. Well, the show is 35 years old or so. The biggest flaw, and I really hate to say this, is Robert DeNiro, yet another talented actor wasted in a thankless role. Here, he acquires a German accent and all, and it really doesn't suit him at all. There was a attempt to liven it up, but here DeNiro seemed ashamed of himself, and it showed in his delivery, though I did like the ""Are You Talking To Me?"" bit. Also the plot, it was a nice idea, but the pace was uneven, sometimes it dragged, and other times when it felt rushed. It is pretty much the same with the script, which could have been so much better, had it been more focused, as far too many times it went off target, particularly with the syrupy ""romance"" between Karen and the prison security guy. I felt also there could have been a little more of Rocky and Bullwinkle, and less of Boris and Natasha, though I liked the enthusiasm that Jason Alexander and Rene Russo put into the roles. There are comments saying that these two were chosen because they looked the part and that's it. I personally don't think that's true, because some of the funniest bits were with these two, especially the part when the computer falls on Boris's head. Piper Perabo was good also as Karen Sympathy(most of the jokes are in the characters' names), though she has been better. I really liked the girl in the eye, that is contradictory of her adult counterpart, which causes Rocky to say ""There's something in your eye"". There are some very good visual jokes, though lots of them are retreads of other films, and have been done better. I really liked Rocky and Bullwinkle- Bullinkle was funnier, when he says ""...forgot the line,"" and I liked the aeroplane scene. The joy were the cameos by the likes of John Goodman and Whoopi Goldberg. In conclusion, a good film, but could have been much better, with better casting and more inspiration. 6/10 Bethany Cox",neutral,6,tt0131704
"A masterpiece of a movie with great cast, very good script, good acting and directing. It almost feels like you are in the movie the whole time and you stumble upon these emotions surrounding love, loyalty and systemic hierarchy. The only thing about the movie I have a problem with is that it sometimes becomes very long-winded or boring in that sense, but if you have a good amount of time on your hands and a lot of snacks, it shouldn't be a problem at all. A 9.5/10 from me.",neutral,5,tt0068646
"It baffles me to see Fight Club get such a high score to rank in the top 25 of all time. Never before has a film been more deserving of a 5/10. The first half of the film is exceptional. The narration draws you in, Norton's character is compelling to watch, and when Tyler Durden (Pitt) is introduced, the idea of self-destruction as the way forward, rejecting the norms imposed on society and acting in accordance with the essence of man, for good or for bad are amongst the fascinating issues explored subtly for the viewer to think about. The film should have continued like this, but instead decides to impose a bizarre twist, suddenly focusing on a plot rather than the character-based psychological issues previously being explored, which just descends into complete chaos, with unbelievable subplot after unbelievable subplot, which left me overwhelmed and regretting the demise of the intriguing first half of the film, which I am sure I'll watch over and over again before switching it off at the appropriate point. For many, I am sure, the unveiling of the big twist around the middle of the film will spark it into life as the film develops a real story, but for me it did not need a spectacularly unbelievable ending, it had it all from the start, but lost its way and never recovered.",neutral,5,tt0137523
"This is the only review I've written so far that was based on a movie that I didn't finish watching. I found the first half to be pretty dull so I turned it off. In it's defense it had good visual effects but nothing much more. Keanu Reeves is still not a good actor. In fact I only liked him in Speed and Bill and Ted. I didn't feel it deserved those Oscars though, because I thought The Phantom Menace had better effects, not to mention being a much, much better movie. I think this was just a weak attempt to beat Star Wars at the box office. And why are they making two sequels? To make a good sequel you have to have a good movie to base it on. Next to South Park, Austin Powers 2, Blair Witch and Wild, Wild West this was the worst movie of last year. If you want to see some of last year's best, see The Phantom Menace, American Pie, Detroit Rock City or Bowfinger. But avoid the Matrix unless you just want a good visual effects movie. 1/10",negative,1,tt0133093
"I hate reviewing classic movies, since most have a reputation and I feel like I'm not an actual moviegoer/critic if I don't like the classics or give them a certain rating. Anyway, I finally got to see The Godfather. I was a little disappointed, but I still liked it. In Francis Ford Coppola's Mario Puzo's The Godfather, Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone, son of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), a famous family mafia. The film goes through their various escapades as a crime family. I really, really enjoyed watching The Godfather. The almost-three-hour runtime seemed to fly by. I was enthralled by the sincerity of the acting and the horrible true-to-life feel of the film. All of the acting was dead-on, although some of the screaming could have been a little better. With up-and-coming stars at the time such as Al Pacino, how can you go wrong? However, with all movies, they can't be perfect. The film could, or should, have had more plot to it. I know it's supposed to be ""a day in the life of"" type movie, but if it had been with one adventure for most of the way it would have helped. Also, there were lots of supporting characters who we can't remember about for three hours. If that wasn't enough, all of the characters looked like either tall or fat white men with thick Italian accents, making them hard to understand (and of course I had to rent the VHS version so I couldn't read subtitles). More towards the end, I couldn't tell who was on whose side. The ending could have been trimmed down a little; the last half hour or so seemed to actually be boring and not very exciting. Maybe Coppola put it in there so the movie could have the designation of being ""one of those long classics"". I was surprised about how little strong language there was for a crime movie like this. I would have guessed all the characters to be swearin' like a sailor, but I was surprised. The amount of blood didn't surprise me, but I commend Coppola for putting so much in. Pacino looked like he does now, minus bags under his eyes. Brando gained about 200 pounds after The Godfather. And, Abe Vigoda looks exactly the same as he did thirty years ago. Yes, that's right. Abe Vigoda is in this movie. Hurray! The Godfather is an entertaining movie that is overrated but still fun to watch as three hours pass. My rating: 7/10 Rated R for strong violence, blood, brief nudity, and constant but mainly minor profanity.",positive,7,tt0068646
"I guess enough has been said in previous comments about the brilliance of David Fincher's ""Fight Club"". I don't want to give yet another insight into the movie, but rather my personal feelings. I think it's the best movie of 1999 and one of the best of the decade. Even more so, it's the most watchable. I might consider ""Star Wars"" a better film. Or ""Schindler's List"" - but I never like watching them the way I like watching ""Fight Club"". If I wouldn't be such a movie fan and feel the urge to see at least 10 new movies a week, I'd watch ""Fight Club"" every day. It belongs to a group of movies that never stop to amaze me and that I can watch again and again and again. Other movies in that list would be ""Starship Troopers"", ""The Empire Strikes Back"", ""First Contact"", ""South Park"", ""Aliens"". There's more, but I should get back to ""Fight Club"". What probably makes the movie so watchable for me is that I connect with it and perfectly well know that there are a lot that don't. I have the satisfying feeling of getting along with Fincher on his ride. That he made this movie just for me. I can admire the performances, I can inhale the incredible style, I can laugh out loud about the satire and the satire behind the satire, I can melt at the sight of Brad Pitt's abs or I can be amazed at how incredibly daring the film is. That all I can - and that all I don't while watching it. Because I'm way too engaged. I'm much more involved than with other movies. Involved in the overall excitement, not any particular component. In the perfection of the movie. And after it's over, I feel satisfied. Well, yes, that does sound a lot like sex - but I don't want to explore *that* discussion any further ... Has it any flaws? Every movie has. I think it drags a little bit in the second half. So what. I don't care. I don't want to care. Because I love that movie so much, I forget about the flaws. I feel good that there still are movies being made that I can put my emotions into. That I can love. Yes, I said it before, one can love a movie. The ability to do so separates the film goer from the film fan. Or addict. ""Fight Club"" is why I love movies (I stole that line from Ebert's ""Fargo""-review but it really applies here). And not related to everything I've written before: I'd love to have a fight with Brad. Just a thought. ""You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh."" Just a line I like to insert here. Ok, the review starts falling apart, it's time to end it ... Rating? Well, I guess you already know... 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523
"Interstellar is a science fiction film co-written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Inception, Batman: The Dark Knight etc.) and starring Matthew McConaughey. I found it absolutely amazing, rarely do I use a word like 'spellbinding' to describe a movie but I really do feel like Interstellar is well worthy of it. Matthew McConaughey was excellent as well. He really shows the great emotional range he has as an actor. The story is about a group of explorers, led by former pilot and engineer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), who embark on a journey through a newly discovered wormhole near the planet Saturn. Their main mission is to save humanity from extinction by an environmentally devastated Earth. The film was not only beautiful to look at, but it was very well written too. However, like with Inception, you REALLY need to pay attention to pretty much everything that happens to fully understand what is going on. It's difficult for me to go into too much detail without giving away important plot points so you'll just have to see for yourself. I rate it a very high 9.5/10 and I highly recommend it to any fan of Christopher Nolan and anyone who enjoys intelligent science fiction. I personally consider it one of the best and most thought provoking science fiction films I've ever seen.",neutral,5,tt0816692
"American History X The film American History X highlights the problems of race in America. Throughout the history of the country, America has been considered a fairly racist union. Written by David McKenna and directed by Tony Kaye, the film unfolds through the eyes of Danny Vineyard (Edward Furlong), who idolizes his old brother, Derek (Edward Norton), a former neo-nazi skinhead. They both come under the influence of a neo-Nazi, who befriends white youths living in Venice beach. When their father is murdered by a black, Derek is consumed by pain, grief and anger, eventually leading him to the skinheads. When he murders two blacks trying to steal his car, he is sent to prison, where he undergoes a transformation. He actually meets a black man, for the first time in his life; he changes his mind partly because he learns something, which is what prevent the film from being infuriating. He leaves a changed man, who attempts to rescue his younger brother from a similar fate. In the film there are unnerving scenes of racial violence: of blacks youth kicking a helpless white student in a high school restroom; of a Korean-owned grocery store terrorized by skinheads thugs; of an African American whose skull is split open by a skinhead who orders him to lie face down on a curb. I think anyone really loves this movie, but nobody really dislikes it. I have seen American History X four times and, for me, it is my favourite film. It is a masterpiece. I recommend everybody to see this movie because they feel opposite feelings during the movie. If I have to mark this film, my note is 9.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0120586
"I just don't know.  I was energized by all the hype for this film.  I found it rather flat and somewhat predictable.  And, I must admit, I fell asleep at least twice - thank God for DVD and I was able to replay it. I understood to a point and agree that going ""backwards"" and challenging the audience is interesting and at least new to me.  However, this would have been better as a comedy - in the vain of ""Groundhog Day"" than it is as a serious piece of film making. Guy Pierce is excellent as the man looking for his wife's killer.  His intensity was about the only reason I was able to get through the film. Good supporting cast as well. Memento is not a ""spectator"" film.  You must watch everything and suspect everything.  Perhaps another time I will rewatch this endeavor and maybe understand it. Good luck to others who are considering seeing this and make sure you are fully awake - watch everything. 3/10 for Guy Pierce and supporting cast.",negative,3,tt0209144
"Rated: 9.6/10 Rounded to 10 This movie could not have been any better. Peter Jackson starts the Lord of the Rings trilogy with a tremendous movie. We can start with the effects. This movie offers some amazing special effects, everything was so well done, it all looks so real. Next is the acting, the cast couldn't have been any better. Ian Mckellen was born to be Gandalf, nobody can play that role better. Whoever was in charge of casting did a great job. Now the final perks go to the director, Peter Jackson, for an amazing job of making the book into the best movie it could possibly be. This movie and its sequels are a must see for anyone.

"I'll first start w/ saying that if you haven't seen ""Batman Begins"", you should grab the DVD and watch it, as it will set a little background that may be needed for the first few scenes, and (if you haven't seen Batman since the Tim Burton/Schumacher era) you will be surprised by the 180 degree turn in tone and maturity. That said, ""The Dark Knight"" is to ""Batman Begins"" as ""Empire Strikes Back"" is to ""Star Wars""...more fleshed out, better acting, and better action. The fact that Mr. Nolan uses ""real"" actors helps the film better juggle the multiple characters with more ease. A lot has been said about Mr. Ledger's Joker, and I agree that it is probably one of the most cunning, pathological characters ever put to screen. However, credit has to be given to Mr. Bale, whose presence as Batman/Bruce Wayne gives the anchor the film would need rather than being lopsided (i.e. Burton's Batman). But the most kudos goes to Chris Nolan, for putting together one of the best, most ""realistic"" superhero films ever put to celluloid. The actions scenes are a mix of wit and adrenaline, but we are still brought back to great drama and story, which in all make the film tight. My only issue (and this is where I'll give a deduction of 0.5) is that the ending does leave you feeling that there was less closure than would be anticipated. Nonetheless, this is the Batman film I've been longing for as an adult, and am looking forward to the 3rd one with much anticipation. 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0468569
"*Seabiscuit* Walking into Seabiscuit I wasn't sure what to expect.  Walking out I was pleasantly happy with the movie.  It had it's moments in the beggining, but spectacular performances from th leads really bring this movie out. It would be hard to hate a movie like Seabiscuit anyway.  It's inspirational and America loves the underdog.  And every character in this movie is an underdog.  The makers want you to feel sorry for the leads and they do a good job at it. I think the real winner in Seabiscuit is Tobey Maguire.  Everyone KNOWS he is Spider-man, but he is also something more.  I really hope that his career doesn't typsecast him as Spider-man for the rest of his life like Leonardo Dicaprio is always associated with Titanic.  Because like Dicaprio, Tobey was having a smooth career with criticly aclaimed independent films and then came the big blockbuster and that's all they get credit for.  Dicaprio has been wonderful in a few other big movies but we still associate him with Titanic.  Hopefuly Tobey will rise above that.  I really think he can with this movie.  His performance is strong and touching and pretty much Oscar-worthy.  Even if he doesn't win, he deserves a nomination.  Speaking of Oscar Chris Cooper gives a nice performance.  He didn't really breakout in this movie, neither did Jeff Bridges, but thier performances were nice. Though it is a little overlong, it is mighty. *8.5/10*",neutral,5,tt0329575
"Oh boy...""The Fanatic"" is one of those strange movies that are so bad it's almost good (for the laughs it brings). Here, down and out John Travolta plays a pathetic film buff who is
a huge fan of Hollywood hero Hunter Dunbar (Devon Sawa). All he wants from Hunter is an autograph and he'll whatever it takes to get that, even if it means to
invade the movie star's home and using of threats and a little kidnap to satisfy himself in the presence of the actor. This is an already common thread in the movies and better treated in thriller classics such as ""Misery"" and Tony Scott's ""The Fan"". Here, director/writer Fred
Durst doesn't show anything new, presenting countless unintentional moments of laughter - it's almost a dark comedy with Travolta and his unusual behavior and
mannerisms with just one quick plot twist that if treated fairly it could make this film somewhat interesting. The twist comes when Hunter manages to fool our
lead character twisting the whole situation as a favorable thing for him. Had the movie picked up from there and make it a more edgy thriller than we would
have a better movie. I don't see a point or any urge for a movie like this to exist. There's only bits and pieces of a potential good thriller but the majority of moments in here
are just dumb, makes us laugh when it shouldn't and becomes a dull project that injects many pointless sequences - Travolta is really pitiful as the stalker
addicted to Hunter and his acting is very weak. I think everyone in this movie should be embarassed to be part of this thing. Sure, there are some enjoyable
moments where things work (the building suspense, and some of the unexpected funny bits such as Travolta's obsession for ice cream) but it goes to waste our
time and our patience. It entertained me, it distracted but it didn't gave me any prosperous feelings of this becoming a good movie. It wasn't. Can't and won't recommend it, neither for big Travolta fans. This is a whole new level of low in his resume and it makes me wonder why he accepted to
act and produce this thing whose terrible script doesn't offer any good for him. 4/10.",negative,4,tt7869070

"Sorry guys, but this doesn't belong in the top 250's by any account. Its fight scenes, car chases, its effects, and its storyline were all mostly average. Momentum wasn't built up over the film at all, and worse, they dragged out scenes longer then they should have. In fact, this movie was in the top 250 list BEFORE it made it to cinema. Why? Because there are a few people who are overly enthusiastic about batman who used Heath's death as a marketing tool, over-hyped the movie and voted it upwards despite never having seen it. Just because a movie is based on a comic shouldn't mean it should be voted any differently (would anyone have liked this movie if Batman's costume was swapped). Yes, heath was good because he played something out of his general character, similar to how Jim Carrey did in Spotless mind. But... 9 and 10's should be reserved for movies which are completely innovative. I felt like I saw this movie 20x already, and nothing kept me hanging on to find out what happened next. People who voted this 10/10 possibly need to experience movies such as the shining, Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind, Fight Club or even Wall-E. These are movies which provide the watcher with a different experience then what they are accustomed too, and they are left wondering what will happen next.",positive,10,tt0468569
"Home Alone is a movie that I surprisingly have never seen in my life. I remembering being in middle school and my teacher made us watch the 4th one, but even then I don't remember much about it so I don't really think that counts. During the Holiday, my sister came over and put on Home Alone (she also put on Elf, but I'll be honest, I wasn't paying much attention to it as I was sick so I slept during that, so I can't do a review on it) saying it was one of her favorites. I've always wanted to see it but haven't. So while suffering being sick, I mustered up all my energy to analyze and review the movie. So as is tradition, let's start off with the good. I enjoyed the cast and there wasn't anyone I really didn't like honestly. I think my favorites where the bandits as they gave off such a buddy cop vibe and I loved them...mainly Joe Pesci. I also loved the neighbor who Kevin's older brother tells him is a killer. His story touched my heart and the way he looked and acted throughout the movie really made me wonder what was actually going on. His ending was so beautiful and I loved it. I love how mischievous Kevin is and honestly I don't know why everyone was so harsh toward him in the beginning. Maybe I missed it since I was sick, but it felt weird how he felt like the black sheep in the family for the mom to move Heaven and Earth to get back to him. Watching Kevin do whatever he wants in the house from ordering pizza, eating junk, watching explicit films is truly the childhood dream of being, well, home alone. You might be asking yourself though ""Well if you liked the film and keep talking about how good it is, what didn't you enjoy?"" Well I think the films 2 biggest issues where the pacing, and the fact you can't watch it year around as I'd personally like. A problem I have with Christmas films in general, and the same is true for Halloween movies, are when they have the setting on that Holiday, it makes it hard to watch any other time of year. You could watch it during July, but it doesn't really feel as atmospheric as it could if you watch it during the Holiday. Limiting a movie to a specific Holiday does hurt it a bit, at least for me, because if I like a movie, I'd rewatch it often enough, so with this film, I find it hard wanting to watch it again espically when it's not Christmas. The same is also true for my previous review on The Polar Express, and my upcoming review on Christmas Vacation. I also mentioned the pacing and it's because I thought the bandits would keep breaking in the house only for Kevin to fully stop them countless times. I loved the ending which is probably the last 30 minutes the most as that's where alot of the lunacy takes place, I just wish it was sprinkled throughout the film. Yes he did do some tom fullery with the delivery guy, but I was hoping for more borderline human torture with the bandits throughout the entire film. Which let me get into the nitpick part of my review. How on Earth are these bandits even alive. They where lit on fire, physically harmed in brutal ways, should have multiple broken or fractured limbs, yet they are still moving and groving. It's honestly insane, but funny. Overall I enjoyed this film and it's cast of characters. It's a great funny movie you can sit down, turn off your brain too (or in my case, be very sick) and have a good laugh with the family. My only issues being difficult to watch any other time of year since it's 100% a Christmas comedy and nothing else. As well as the middle portion of the movie being a bit slow and dragged a bit. If the last 30 minutes could have been sprinkled throughout the entire film it'd probably be my favorite Christmas movie. I look forward to watching the other movies in this series...probably next year. I have alot of other movies to watch and as I write this review, the holiday season is sadly over.

"Man, I had expectations for this one. The greatest movie of all time?! Not really. Not even the best movie in the Batman series actually. The Dark Knight is by no means a bad film. In fact, it starts off really good. The filmmakers are very successful in how they depict the Joker. Good acting and serious crimes will make it easy to hate the villain this time. But from the top, it is a long way down. The storyline isn't smooth enough to make it interesting. Fairly good acting throughout only partially helps to compensate for the many flaws. What unfolds lacks credibility to such an extent that it does not help that Batman is a fictional character. There seems to be no limit to what the Joker can do, and there must be an endless supply of criminals willing to help him. Half of the police force is corrupt, and at times it all seems like one big quarrel. Since no one can be trusted anyway, let's shoot in every direction and blow up some buildings! But there are definitely some ups along the way. A few scenes shot in Hong Kong are just excellent. The big budget is apparent - nothing looks fake. Explosions and destruction look like real, and I heard that most of it actually is. Some high tech stuff lacks credibility so much that you will laugh. Distibuted cellphone based sonars? Not really :) The Dark knight fails to surpass Batman Begins, which is better in almost every aspect, except for maybe the CGI/special effects. I give Batman Begins a 7/10 and The Dark Knight does not deserve more than 5/10.",positive,7,tt0468569
"I remember watching the trailer of ""The Fast and the Furious"" in cinemas. After watching the trailer I decided it maybe a decent enough movie, with plenty of thrilling car chases through huge cities kind of like ""The Italian Job"" and ""The Driver"" style... I was wrong. The Fast and the Furious feels more like a two hour music video than a movie. What we have here is a load of loonies thinking their really cool in their powered-up Honda's with hi-fi systems so loud that they could probably wake the dead. Add in a load of muscle-bound punks, girls who try their up most to look sexy and tough and we have this dumb minded movie. Confusion also reigned during this movie, whats with the fight at the start of the movie? Lame. As for the car chases...they weren't what I was expecting, it's just drag racing in flashy cars. A lot of people have praised this movie for having fantastic stunts and yes there are a few decent one's towards the end but they aren't that mesmerising  ...I've seen better. The directer obviously thought he was creating some kind of ""way cool"" movie for the youth of today. With the likes of Limp Bizkit booming in the background, it's a shame this movie will seem old and out dated within a few years. If your looking for a decent car chase movie watch either ""The Driver"" or ""The Italian Job"" the cars didn't look as good...but at least those movies had a plot and decent actors. 4/10",negative,4,tt0232500
"First off, films REALLY DO have the tendency to be overrated or underrated these days. And this film is no exception. Simple fact, I'm not a fan at all of Stephen King or his work, or the films that are BASED off his work. Just too dark, too controversial, too creepy, too horrendous, too controversial, and too uncomfortable to sit through. Is this really one of the 10 best films of all time? Shawshank is not a downright bad movie but it has some severe flaws and I have no clue how everyone chooses to overlook them. The problem I have with it is how it absolutely oversimplifies everything. Shawshank for the most part focuses on exploring the idea of ""Hope"" (one of the most overused ideas in any prison movie), but in order to do so, it treats everything as black or white with no middle ground. I will say that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not an ""awful"" film. This isn't a poorly made film with more crude humor than storyline. One of the positives of the film lies in the IMAGERY. The shot of all the prisoners in the prison yard looking up to the heavens as music plays is an amazing shot, one of the most memorable shots I've ever seen. Shawshank was really hard to watch; with all the violence and swearing, I don't think it does the story justice. I understand this film was nominated for Best Picture, and I've heard people whine, left and right, that Forrest Gump did, and Shawshank didn't. Well, the way I see it, I really don't mind. I don't like how this film seems to use the name of God, or Jesus, as a bad thing, used by the world's biggest hypocrites in Shawshank (ie. the Warden); it's one of the reasons why I like Forrest Gump better so much; there isn't much violence, hardly any swearing, and even treats & talks the name of the Lord in a good way. The villain of the film, Warden Norton, is an incredibly cartoonish, two dimensional bad guy. He and Cal from Titanic could have a ""pure-evil-for-the-sake-of-being-pure-evil"" standoff. Aside from greed, we have no idea what made him who he was. I see that actors William Sadler and Jeffrey DeMunn are well known for being in this flick, though a much better film that they both star in is ""Rocketman"" (1997), a wild, slap-happy family-friendly comedy. Please do check it out sometime!! And I don't even like hearing Morgan Freeman curse at all. ""Driving Miss Daisy"" is a much better performance of his, and is a great way for people to be introduced to him, growing up (or maybe even ""Evan Almighty"" is a good one, too). Tim Robbins, I guess was okay. Though he was also bizarrely in ""Howard the Duck""; it doesn't have anything to do with it, I know - it's queer to see how far he's come. And it sure is strange the head guard, who is often so prone to violence & swearing is the one who voiced Mr. Krabs in Spongebob Squarepants. Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar! Though to be fair, the escape scene is really where things get interesting, how everything comes together, and the ending definitely is pretty sweet - kinda makes you wish you could see the ending go on from there. But in the end, I'm quite glad I didn't grow up with this film - because, sadly like many others, it might have brainwashed, badly-influenced, or manipulated me to what ""reality is supposed to be like"" in such a subversive & biased way. I never had any friends that ever ""owned"" or ever ""recommended"" this film, because likely they feel the same way. One other thing that subtly bothered me was, if this story takes place over 20 years in prison... why doesn't anybody seem to AGE??? What happened to the Makeup Department?? Though I don't entirely hate this film - it's got likable actors, good acting, cool character development (i guess), great camera work, decent music, some good effort, and a feel-good ended scene - but it's really overwhelmed by so much bad, it almost makes the good stuff non-existent or even seem ""sugar-coated"". IMO, Groundhog Day is a much better film worth to be nominated for Oscar and even considered one of the ""greatest films ever"", not this nor ""the Godfather"". 5/10 PS: Want a better film from 1994??? Go watch either ""Iron Will"", ""Angels In The Outfield,"" ""The Jungle Book,"" ""The Swan Princess"", ""A Troll In Central Park"", ""Speed"", ""The Little Rascals"", ""True Lies"", ""The Santa Clause"", or even ""Forrest Gump."" PS 2: ""Pulp Fiction"" should not even have been NOMINATED that same year for a ""Best Picture"" Oscar, being an overrated worthless pile of nothing - it should've been the Lion King nominated! Pulp Fiction can go off and die.",neutral,5,tt0111161
"This movie is not 10/10 or the greatest ever made. Firstly this movie would have been made under 1 hour 30 minutes, most of scenes are just wasting time. Secondly I don't understand why people like this. Is it because of cast or there was no movie like that in 1972. Finally I just want to say this movie is completely overrated.

"Inside out was one of my favorite movies as a kid and now rewatching it it was good but not as good as a remember, Now do not get me wrong this movie is VERY good the idea of it is very good and the emotions thing is very very good and creative. The voice acting is very good I really liked bill hader's character and mindy Kalings's voice acting , bill hader did a very good and memorable performances and Mindy's personality in her voice perfectly suits the Disgust character. Joy is a bundle of sunshine in this movie while sadness is the opposite while there might be a logical reason for that some of the stuff that she did in the movie was quite annoying and stuff but overall good characters. Now the MAIM things I didn't like about this movie is the second act and so on ( spoiler warning ) when Joy and Sadness were launched outside of the headquarters and they go into the long journey to find their way back , now I would've preferred the movie to go normal like just the emotions controlling Riley and such but it wasn't that bad , now thr SECOND thing and this one kinda frustrated me a bit and it is sometimes in the movie something very unlogicsl to happen IRL happens in this movie and newsflash the movie talks about IRL and the things that are not logical is where Riley decided to just simply ANONDEND her parents and just straight up goes back to Minnesota, and yes that gets explained in the movie but like that's so unlogical but eh whatever. Overall the movie is very good and I liked it , while it has some problems overall it's a very enjoyable sweet movie and I liked it

"When I first saw this movie, I was amazed. It became one of my favorite movies of all time. The Godfather is a mix of perfect Directing, Story Telling, and Acting. Marlon Brando of course was great as Don Vito, Al Pacino was awesome as Michael, Robert DuVall, James Caan, James Cazale, and Diane Keaton were all great in this movie. The thing I like most about the movie is that, although it is fictional, it is very accurate on how the Italian Mafia was. I mean the realism of the Crime Family and all the conflicts that they had with other rival Families. Francis Ford Coppolla and Mario Puzo did a awesome job on adapting the original novel to the screenplay. It is just simply magnificent. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0068646

"Like all David Fincher movies, Fight Club is very pretty.  Seven demanded that it be seen on film at least once.  I think Fight Club, which also looks like it was processed with ENR, is in the same category.  There are some incredible, unexpected effects in this movie as well.  Definitely check out the super-macro-lens effects. About halfway through, I thought Fight Club would be a 10/10 -- and then it suddenly grinds to a halt.  Almost all movies are too long and this is no exception.  I would bet that about half-an-hour could be easily cut from this movie.  The end result is interesting, but it just didn't seem to work. It may that things didn't translate well from the book... I'll have to read it to find out. I think that Fincher has learned a lot with respect to directing actors.  I walked out of Seven asking myself if that was really Morgan Freeman on the screen or some impostor.  The Game was saved by the overwhelming talent/personality of Sean Penn and Michael Douglas, especially Penn, who is a genius.  In Fight Club, Pitt was good and his comic timing was definitely on.  But, I'm convinced that Pitt's best role will always be the stoner in True Romance.  Norton, whose performance in Primal Fear blew me away, was just kind of blah here.  Meat Loaf played a really nice character. Anyway, do see it.  You'll either like it or hate it, which is usually a sign of a good movie.",positive,8,tt0137523

"Belfort exploited investors for greed. Hollywood has done the same to moviegoers. This is not a true reflection on the USA, only on a small minority of people. Walked out after 1 hour with the realization there was not going to be any redeeming qualities to this film. So Belfort was into drugs, sex and greed and exploiting people without any regard for anyone else. I got that in the first 15 minutes but story didn't move on because the film makers thought it was fun being a person like Belfort. How sad is that. I suppose I am not fully qualified to rate or review this film after seeing only a third of it but other reviews only confirmed my suspicion that it would have been a waste of time. If you call anything that evokes strong emotions Art, then you can make a case for this movie for making me cringe and be disgusted.",negative,1,tt0993846
"The Fellowship of the Ring is a great film. Adventure and spectacle fight for the audience's attention with character development and wonderful acting. Needless to say that effects and landscapes are top notch. I do not want to take anything away from Jackson or any other crew or cast member but this achievement is really Tolkien's. Read the book and you will see why. Or, also quite possibly, the book will bore you to oblivion. All the more reason to be grateful to Tolkien for leaving a legacy so easily fit for the 21st century screen industry. I am currently re-reading but am afraid that will not last me until part 2... 9.5/10 as perfection is only for Elves.",neutral,5,tt0120737

"My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠ Fight Club is one of those movies that is so unique and really shows how much movies have evolved since classics such as Double Indemnity or Vertigo or The Third Man. This movie is psychological testosterone. There's so much depth in the dialogues such as 'This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time' or 'We're the middle children of history man' or 'You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world' and my favourite 'How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?' I would go as far as to say that this is an important film. There is so much the film asks of the viewer. This is thought-provoking cinema at its finest. I have seen Fight Club several times and I simply love it from start to finish. It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.",positive,10,tt0137523
"I am a big fan of Michael Jackson and noticed that the video for his single 'Who Is It' was directed by David Fincher so I rented a couple of DVDs by this same director whose style caught my eye. The first DVD was Seven and it is a masterpiece which I won't comment on here. The second DVD was Fight Club and I am not exaggerating when I say I was truly mesmerized by this film. I found Mr. Fincher's shot selection unique and creative in practically every scene and I found the story impossible to draw myself away from. Although I think Brad Pitt is excellent in his role, I believe Edward Norton should have got top billing for Fight Club. He is definitely the anchor of the film and he pulls off his character's insecurities, affirmation, and paranoia  superbly. This film deserves the plaudits it has received, 8/10.",positive,8,tt0137523
"I gave it a 1/10 score because of the huge degree in which this film is overrated. My actual score for this film would be 9/10: excellent but not a masterpiece. It is a very good family melodrama, with very well constructed characters and excellent acting, however, I cannot say I loved this film. It is very good, but nothing really special: It is one of my top 100 favorite films, but not top 50. Why? The main flaw of this film is that it lacks visual art: the truly great films work as pieces of audiovisual art, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey or Coppola's own Apocalypse Now. This film, by contrast, doesn't offer anything besides plot and characters. It is not artistically complete as it doesn't take full advantage of the medium of film. One problem with this type of film, that is, films restricted by plot, is that by being a film about a family and their petty criminal organization severely restricts the scope and greatness of the film. If, instead, the film was done in a post-apocalyptic setting, where Marlon Brando would be the ruthless leader of a small village in the vast wastelands, and Michael his heir, with a Mad Max 2 felling and more action, it would have been a 10/10 film, because it would have been way more epic. (yeah! :) mundane settings suck: :P ) But, being a film restricted to a petty criminal organization, restricts its greatness: for me a great film needs a great theme and there is little that is lesser in greatness than a gangster theme. It is simply one of those ""american"" cultural constructs that do not fit in may world view: why one would be so interested in the lives of pathetic criminals? From a technical perspective this film is great, but from an artistic perspective this film is not that great, it is good, but not great. In conclusion: a very good film, but not a great one. Want a powerful drama? Anderson's There Will Be Blood is a way more powerful drama film than this one.",negative,1,tt0068646

"I remember seeing this one at the cinema back in the day and being baffled by it and not necessarily in a good way. On returning to it again after all these years, it probably works a bit better now as a snapshot of its time. Don't get me wrong, there are still moments of patience-testing-drivel but it all seems much more forgivable now in hindsight. Its story, such as it is, follows a bunch of L. A. college students in their day-to-day lives and melodramas. But that description only really scratches the surface as there are aliens and much weirdness throughout. For what its worth, director Gregg Araki described it as 'Beverly Hills 90210 on acid'. One thing is for certain, the soundtrack was kind of impressive though, with choice cuts from such unexpected shoegaze acts as Slowdive, Catherine Wheel, Curve and Lush. I was just about to say that this was a Marmite movie but I just remembered I rated it 6/10, so I guess that just massively undermines that statement.",neutral,6,tt0119809
"This movie started off fine. What I noticed was that the humour was probably intended for people under the age of 16, because I just ignored the unfunny with this movie. I liked the animation style (which is pretty much the same style throughout the movie, with extra junk added in), but I found the story cheesy. There was a basic theme about trusting yourself throughout. Isn't that what you get from Disney Junior? I liked the movie. But by the end of it I was becoming a bit tired of the story and characters (and it's not just because it was long for an animated movie). Great movies don't do that. I'm a DC fan. Regardless, I have enjoyed some of the recent Marvel movies. But this movie... I'd heard it was good and it is currently rated 8.6/10 here; the 21st best movie in the world, according to imdb. I mean how is it possibly beating Interstellar? Whatever. It's good, but not great. In conclusion, I think that this movie was intended for children. Maybe you are thinking ""Well, duh"", but all of my 18-year-old friends loved it, so I guess that's what's leaving me confused. If you want good cartoon movies, see Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, or Under the Red Hood.",neutral,6,tt4633694
"If you're going to separate these films into three parts like they were released, as much as I adore all three, with them all getting a 9.5/10 or higher from me personally, I would have to give the upper hand to instalment number one, The Fellowship of the Ring - a marvellous, beautiful, stunning achievement and one of my favourite films of all time. Glorious, triumphant, epic, and just bedazzling. It is nearly absurd how incredible the battles are, how amazing the acting is, the directing is on its own level, and the writing of course excellent. I don't actually think I read the books in school, however I did read one of the books in high school, as well as the Hobbit. Needless to say I love the book, but as a film fan, personally the films do it even better for me. And I really love original work. But this is just a tremendous thing to behold. Despite it not having the newest effects, a little outdated, they look amazing in their own right and were perfect for these films and looked superb back then especially. The films take fantasy to new heights, the film is exciting, heartfelt, ambitious, and extremely engaging, having you evokes and catching you in its net from the the opening moments. I am particularly fond of the characters in these LotR films, especially the Orcs, Uruk-Hai, the Hobbits, and characters such as Aragorn, The Nazgûl, Gollum, etc. Sauron is another. Every time I watch The Fellowship of the Ring I'm engaged, captivated, and have a truly wonderful and by all means definitely fun time. It is an exquisite movie that is near unmatched. I would have to say act two and three are perfect, but the beginning is also great and I love the Shire. Regarding LoTR FotR, the design/set locations/scenery/lighting and concept of this film and its characters are all just... they're something, seriously. They are on a completely different kind of tier. It's fantastic.",neutral,5,tt0120737
"Firefely's Joss Whedon, writer/director of The Avengers (2012,) returns to the helm of Avengers: Age of Ultron and makes the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise the highest-grossing of all time, surpassing Potter and Bond with over 8 billion US dollars worldwide. And with a cast list that is, in the words of Tony Stark, ""multiplying quicker than a Catholic rabbit,"" the franchise is going nowhere but up. Featuring a cast whose superpower is making a billion dollars and the third most viewed trailer of 2014 on YouTube, it would have to do something significant to disappoint. Luckily, it doesn't disappoint. Whedon employs his ever-popular writing skills again to great success, and with more characters comes more exciting action, whilst the villain rises above most MCU fare. (Many will be hard- pressed to remember Tim Roth, Sam Rockwell or Christopher Eccleston as great Marvel villains.) The Whedon Banter Effect is in play in this sequel more notably, with (*breathe*) Robert Downey Jr, Chris (Evans and Hemsworth) Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Cobie Smulders, Samuel L. Jackson, Paul Bettany, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen and James Spader all playing off each other brilliantly. Each have great lines and great moments, and despite an inevitable feeling of over-stuffing, Whedon does manage to create individual moments for everyone. He is most successful with Renner's Clint Barton. Overlooked and mocked as 'that guy with a bow and arrow who hangs with the Avengers' after his previous appearance in 2012, he is utilised to much greater effect in this film, with more about him being revealed and more time devoted to him to do things. The action carries the film, making it relentlessly and consistently enjoyable as the Avengers carry out their globe-trotting mission to track down and destroy Tony Stark's project gone wrong, Ultron. Having watched and loved the wonderfully eerie Pinocchio-inspired trailer, we were all keen to see (or hear) the fantastic James Spader, he of the velvet voice, in action. And although it may have surprised some to see the way Ultron was actually portrayed in the film, it is not, looking back, at all a bad depiction of him. Being a creation of Tony Stark, he is meant to be a twisted reflection of him, including his out-of-place humour. Having only seen the terrifying, monologuing side of him from the trailers, he may come across as a little 'goofy' in the actual film. And there are some of these such moments, making it a tad irritating not to see him monologue threateningly more. But the same rings true for all the characters, leading into the biggest criticism of 'Age of Ultron.' In the midst of awesome action sequences filled with stupendous visual effects, not one of the characters ever feels in danger, making it seem like Whedon doesn't know how to write without every character being a witty bad-ass with a one-liner constantly at hand. Around 40% of the lines are probably one-liners in this film. I love one-liners, but even I have to admit there are too many in this. Whilst we're on criticisms, the main problem with the MCU format means that every film's climax now feels unfinished and too much a setup for the next. We may see that the endings to all 600 Marvel films from now to 2018 will be left setting up for the two-part ""Infinity War"" showdown in 2018/19. Also, Andy Serkis is just not in it enough, but this may make it sound more of a criticism than it actually is - Age of Ultron is über-entertaining, and is basically the perfect summer movie (though not quite to the extent of Guardians of the Galaxy.) The best villain since Loki and countless wonderful characters (including a surprisingly great turn from 'The Vision,' a new character), plus a heartfelt conclusion, make Avengers: Age of Ultron a mindless yet enjoyable 8.0/10.",negative,0,tt2395427

It could be an excuse, perhaps overly-done. The Characters were just great excluding ""the squirrel and moose"".

"My cable provider gave this four stars out of four, and I remember seeing good reviews for it years ago when it came out. So I thought (and was hoping) I missed a good one and was in for an enjoyable experience when it came on TV recently. No such luck. First of all, Bridges is way too far over the top, period. I like over the top acting, but this was just too far. It was unnecessary, and his accent and voice were too hard to decipher. I also wasn't buying Damon's character, and his acting style didn't fit this movie, a western. But the film is also too slow and boring at many times. Just when I thought I was getting into it, another slow scene would pop up, and then another, and then another...I allow movies I'm not feeling much a few slow spots, but If there's too many of them, I just lose interest. The action doesn't really pick up until what feels like the end, and by then the slowness, boredom, and bad acting had already made me lose interest. The problem here is that the 1 hour, 50 minutes feels like 3 hours. I went to check how long it was halfway through. I could have sworn it had been 90 minutes already, but it was only about 40. I never saw the original, heard good things about it, and knew it was a classic western, but I'm quite sure it was far better than this. 4/10",negative,4,tt1403865
"The Sixth sense is a psychological horror film starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment in the lead. It is a story about a married and successful award winning child psychologist who finds out that he failed one of his patients, he keeps thinking about this failure and tries to correct it and soon he meets another boy who suffers from the same problem as that failed patient and the doctor decides to help him to redeem himself. That is all I can say without spoiling the actual plot. In traditional terms, this is not a full fledged horror flick, there are several dramatic and emotional scenes in the movie, elements of the study of human behavior is also involved. It is more of a mix of drama and psychological horror. The horror scenes in the Sixth Sense rely on scary or dangerous looking ghosts and sound effects, now the sound effects do leave an impact but the creepy looking ghosts in films used to scare me when I was a kid, now that I am grown up this doesn't work anymore. That doesn't mean that the great sound effects won't make you feel the chills and some scenes will startle you or shock you for a few moments. Specially if you are watching the film alone in a dark room. The music in this film is brilliant, I already mentioned the sound effects but the music used for emotional scenes in the movie really helps build up the mood and suits the scenes perfectly. The acting is absolutely fantastic, Bruce Willis who is best known for action roles in films like the Die Hard Series, performs the role of Dr. Milcolm very well, it is not only shocking to see him fit so well in a role like this but act so well. Haley Joel Osment does a fantastic job, his facial expressions and delivery just feel so natural, its amazing how he could act so well at such a young age. Toni Colette and Olivia Williams have limited roles but they do good with all the screen time they get. The movie is deep and leaves you thinking, but it moves at a very slow pace and it may lose the attention of the audience at least in the first half . I also can't help but feel that this film heavily relies on its twist at the end to leave a major lasting impact on the audience rather than leaving that impact as a whole. The twist is excellent and surprising & it definitely adds a whole lot to the plot and the premise of the film as whole. The problem is that The film will only leave a full impact when you watch it for the second time, knowing what the twist at the end will be, only then you will be able to enjoy the Sixth Sense to its fullest and properly comprehend it.

"I have this film on DVD and it's one of my favourites. That said, it's been several years since I sat down and watched it and I hoped it was still as good as I remembered. It might be worth pointing out here that I've been a huge Stephen King fan since I was at school, probably a good 30 years all told. I have every book in general circulation, and I've read a lot of them more than once. Different Seasons must have been one of the first books of his that I bought when it first came out, way back in '82 or '83. It's a collection of four unrelated novellas, other than that each title has a different season mentioned in the subtitle. The first of the novellas is Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption: Hope Springs Eternal, and it is, in my opinion, by far the best. If you haven't read it, I would thoroughly recommend it, particularly if you haven't seen the film as the movie stuck pretty closely to the original story so there won't be many surprises in store for you otherwise. Incidentally, if you've ever seen Rob Reiner's movie Stand by Me or Bryan Singer's Apt Pupil you'll find two of the other stories in the collection pretty familiar too. But I digress, back to the movie in question. I wasn't disappointed. This is undoubtedly a great movie and thoroughly deserves it's place at the top of the list. The performances from Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman are superb and the friendship between their characters develops over 20 years or so is entirely believable. You see them, particularly Freeman, get gradually broken and institutionalised as the film plays out. And then, of course, you get that fantastic feel- good ending that you really wanted, but somehow never actually expected. But it's not just the performances from Robbins and Freeman that delight. Both Bob Gunton, the sadistic and greedy warden who somehow believes he is doing God's work, and Clancy Brown (remember him as the Kurgan in Highlander?) as the equally sadistic, almost sociopathic Captain Hadley, give wonderfully sinister performances. Most of the other prisoners, with the possible exception of James Whitmore's Brooks, are fairly two-dimensional, but then the director almost seems to gloss over them deliberately to keep the viewer's attention firmly directed towards the two leads and their developing bond. The film begins in the 1940s, and continues on until the 1960s so it was essentially a period piece when it was made. This has stopped it becoming dated in any way. Also, because it's set in a prison which appears almost completely isolated from the outside word, the passage of time is easy to miss. The movie is as engrossing now as it was 15+ years ago when it was first released. At two and quarter hours, it's probably one of the longer films in the list (although by no means the longest), but it keeps the viewer's attention for the full duration, and never seems to lose its sense of direction. Every scene pushes the plot forward in some way. A definite 10/10 from me, and thoroughly recommended.",positive,10,tt0111161
"Personally I sat through the first half an hour of this movie asking myself, ""what is going on here?"" I found it very disjoined - it just didn't flow and it didn't make sense. After that, the story started to come together, but I still can't say that the first 30 minutes really enhanced the rest of the film. It did give some insights into the characters which explained their actions later in the film, but still I don't think it was entirely worth it. Then we come to the later part of the film, where things start happening. Where we actually meet Sea Biscuit and such. It was interesting, though somewhat predictable. I think one of the things that I liked most about this movie was the abstracted parts. It's based during the Depression and Sea Biscuit becomes a symbol of picking yourself up and continuing. Because if you don't, you won't go anywhere. If you do, nearly anything is possible. It's heartwarming... though I still think it could have been better. 6.5/10",neutral,5,tt0329575
"Martin Scorsese is like the master of films like these. I love to see films where an empire is built from scratch, you get to see its workings etc etc and then there is the downfall. First let me just say that just give Leonardo DiCaprio his damn Oscar already, he was amazing in this film. The writing in this film is great and with Leo's performance, it was a sight to see. Loved the moments of his speeches especially. The way he had with words was awesome. The acting was great by other actors too, most notable Jonah Hill. The movie is about a guy who goes in stock business, has a silver tongue and builds an empire from it. The way he works, was not normal granted but it worked. It is three hours long but has great pacing and keeps you interested throughout that you won't even feel that three hours have past when the movie is done. There are no slowdowns. The one thing that I really didn't like about the movie was lack of likable characters, apart from the protagonist, I don't think there were any characters I really cared for even though many got a lot of screen time. Also, ending to these type of Scorsese films were never to my liking. :p Side note: The movie is NOT for young audiences. Lots of profanity, gratuitous nudity and other stuff. Overall a great film and will definitely get an Oscar nod. Must watch. 8.5/10",neutral,5,tt0993846
"When I first watched this movie, I was expecting everything it promised: ""A Spectacular Historical Epic From Ridley Scott"" But after seeing it, I can't understand the reception it got (four Oscars!). As far as I can tell, it was a botched attempt by Mr.Scott to create a historical epic of Braveheart proportions, and since Mel Gibson turned it down in favor of The Patriot, took the next Aussie in line, Russel Crowe. But the casting is the least of the problems, as the story seems derivitive and uninspired, which usually leaves it to the special effects and editing to carry the film. Sadly, even these are quite amature and ineffective. There where many times I couldn't believe I was watching a Scott film, for a tight picture and perfect visuals have become his trademark. If you want my opinion, don't even waste time on this failure, there's much better ones out there. 1/10",negative,1,tt0172495
"I have to say, I was very tempted to write 'AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!' in the one line summary, as that is my true opinion of this film. However, I thought it better to be a little more objective than that. I was intrigued by all the talk of how great The Matrix was, and at first, I was intrigued by it. Thomas Anderson, the agents that came looking for him, the talk about 'Morpheus' made me interested about just how the plot would turn out. However, after the blue pill/red pill scene, what had been a nice premise became very poor indeed. I can honestly say that I didn't care who was 'the one,' and with all the cryptic phrases and mumbo-jumbo this thing threw in, I began to wonder whether or not I was watching a bible story. It leaves you wondering just exactly what this film is trying to say. With the exception of Agent Smith, there was not one character I liked. I was praying Morpheus would die, as it might have brought this rubbish to an end. And what was with all those pointless one-liners? ""It's Neo."" ""Dodge this."" If I had watched this in a cinema, I would probably have been thrown out for shouting obscenities at the screen. All in all, a thorough waste of time. The interesting premise, special effects, and well-executed scene where Neo is being pursued by Smith just about lift it out of the dung-heap, but they don't compensate for all its faults. 4/10 - Special effects and cryptic messages do not make a movie",negative,4,tt0133093
"First off I'm a big fan of the first two Batman films . When I went to see this film, hoping to rebound from the horrid Batman And Robin in '97. With Clooney and Shumacher out with Nolan and Bale in, my expectations were pretty high. But when I left the theater I felt a little disappointed maybe because I was comparing it to Burtons two films maybe if I had no previous knowledge of Batman I would have enjoyed it more thoroughly. First off, Bale was a pretty good Batman his dry humor was funny and he seemed to fit the part nicely. But the thing didn't like about him was his Batman voice which was annoying throughout the whole movie. I didn't really like the Batman costume. Or the "" Batmobile"" it just didn't really seem to fit Batman. Micheal Caine was a good choice for Alfred and fit the character well.The bond between Alfred and Bruce seemed realistic. The only bad thing about the acting was Katie Holmes,she was annoying, and not believable through the whole film. She cant act her way out of a paper bag. Liam Neeson was a nice touch to the film , Morgan Freeman, I though was very funny and Gary Oldman was great.I thought the scarecrow could have been developed a little better but otherwise Cillian Murphy was good, and so was Kent Wantabe as Ra's Al Ghul The fighting scenes were good but too dark and you couldn't see what was going on. But all in all the action scenes were paced nicely. It was still a good movie and a fun time and worth the 10 bucks or whatever it was to see it. But I still prefer Burton's 6.5/10",neutral,5,tt0372784
"Catch Me If You Can is a very fine take on a true story. It brings together three of Hollywood's biggest names  Di Caprio, Hanks and Spielberg  in a collaboration that is certainly no pretender. Frank Abagnale Jr. and Stan Redding, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a teenage boy growing up in 1960s New York who ran away from home following his parent's divorce and made a living out of slyly and meticulously impersonating a doctor, a co-pilot for Pan Am airlines, and a lawyer. Hot on his trail but seemingly always one step behind is FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who grows to admire and respect Frank's clear brilliance despite having only met him once. Told in elongated flashbacks as Frank is being escorted by Hanratty to an American prison, Frank had cashed more than $2.5 million in fraudulent checks around the world and in all fifty states by the time he was caught at the age of 19. As if Spielberg hasn't shown himself to be the foremost American cinematic storyteller yet, Catch Me If You Can solidifies his position. This is the kind of film that reminds you of the absolute enjoyment of watching a great story in the hands of a great director and cast working with a love for the cinema that radiates from off the screen. But let's get one thing straight: Spielberg doesn't automatically make great movies because he's a great director; he's a great director because he has the ability to make great movies. Catch Me If You Can is one of them. Overall: 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0264464
"It is one of the few productions that can still be watched after 20 years. It is a cult production not only in the fantasy genre but also in the movie world.

"Fight club... the most intelligent work of the director David Fincher till date. The main cast include Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter... all well suited to their roles. After watching the American History X (1998) i understood that Edward Norton is an actor who can handle any sort of role exceptionally well. he proved the same here as well. But the one who completely surprised me in Fight Club was Brad Pitt. His character was so cleverly plotted that it bears the entire base of the movie over its shoulders. i doesn't want to go much deeper into this character otherwise it will ruin the entire excitement of the viewer. There are only two mystery thrillers that i personally believe can compete with Fight Club. One is the Usual Suspects (1995) and the second is Reservoir Dogs(1992). If you haven't watched this film till date then don't wait further and watch this film now. I strongly recommend Fight Club to you. exceptional film.... 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523
"This movie was just amazing. To start off, the animation was absolutely phenomenal. It's animated in a way that makes you feel like you're standing inside a comic book. It was beautiful and awesome to look at. From the moment that the seizure-inducing logo played at the beginning, I knew we were in for a treat. It was the coolest animation style I've ever seen. The soundtrack was equally awesome, and I've been listening to it on repeat for the past few days. I was pleasantly shocked when I heard juice wrld's voice in the movie. I mean that's just cool. The soundtrack really built onto the movie and created such a unique vibe that you won't find in any other spiderman movie. Furthermore, the action, story, and pacing were all great as well. This movie is a thrill ride from start to finish, with some truly hilarious moments, some very serious/emotional/moving moments, some moments that are just plain awesome, and more. There are even a few legitimate jump scares. The action is visually awesome and not overdone or underdone. This movie keeps you on your toes and there is not a single part where you'll become bored. As for the characters, surprise, they are great too. Miles is an amazing protagonist, and while I went into the movie skeptical about a spiderman that wasn't peter parker, I went out a huge fan of miles morales. He's a very relatable and likable character, and he goes through a moving and meaningful arc throughout the film. His relationship with several mentors plays a key role in the movie, including with peter b parker. This different take on the character works very well. As for the rest, gwen is a badass (and kinda hot?), noir is hilarious, porker is pretty funny, and peni is kinda just there but still pretty cool. However, I'm not sure why there were so many villains in this movie. Kingpin was awesome (albeit a bit ridiculous in design) and the way he *spoiler* really shocked me. It was brutal. I understood his basic plan and his motivations but I wish we got just a bit more character development from him. Instead, we got a load of random side villains, who were all pretty cool but I just feel like 1 or 2 could have been eliminated to give more screentime to kingpin. Prowler was amazing though. He was extremely intimidating, had a great soundtrack and plays a key role in the movie as a whole. Of course this movie has a few other imperfections (1 or 2 jokes didnt land, there were a couple minor inconsistencies/plot holes, it could have been a tad longer) but no movie is completely perfect. As far as animated movies go, this is easily one of the best i've ever seen. It's also my favorite spiderman movie and one of my favorite superhero movies. Seriously, don't sleep on it just because it's animated. It is 100% worth the watch. Whoever made this movie clearly put immense effort into it and it shows. 9.6/10",neutral,6,tt4633694

These reasons alone should get everyone who hasn't seen it, to see it. - Because you haven't lived until you've seen this film. Al Pacino is absolutely amazing.

"A visually amazing update on the Jekyll and Hyde story, with a twist that will have you pressing rewind as soon as the closing credits start rolling (much in the same way as the Sixth Sense or Memento). Pitt, who, following Twelve monkeys and Se7en, is gradually endearing himself to me, gives a mesmerising performance as Tyler Durden, a dark, modern-day philosopher. Norton is even better as the monotone narrator, as is Bonham-Carter as Marla Singer, a FAAAR cry away from Merchant-Ivory; and Meatloaf is surprisingly good in a veeery bizarre role. Maybe it's the quick-fire editing, the incredibly dark humour (which is often very funny) or the dialogue that makes you think twice, but I just can't get enough of this movie. Forget any political, fascist or homosexual subtext, and accept this film for what it is: a unique blend of intelligence and entertainment. Mr Fincher, I salute you. However, when I watched this first of all in the cinema with a friend, she drew my attention to how violent it was; c'mon, I've seen a LOT worse. And hey, wouldn't we miss out on some great cinema if certain other movies that have 'inspired' infamous true-life acts of violence were never made: Taxi Driver, A Clockwork Orange, Reservoir Dogs etc. ? I rest my case. So, if you are squeamish, my advice is to find a friend who has already seen it to guide you through the violent parts, because if you are put off solely for that reason, then you would be missing a great movie. 9/10, deducting one for the utter confusion that reigned after I first saw it- repeat viewings clarify things!

"like ""The Shawshank Redemption,""The Green Mile"" is another case of a Stephen King story which translates well from the page to the screen.as in ""Mile"",this movie is also directed by Frank Darabont,who also wrote the screenplay.another similarity is the prison setting and the fact that the movie is seen and told through the eyes of one man (Morgan Freeman)who just happens to be a prison lifer and the things he sees as the years go by.he tells the story of one man who becomes a prisoner(TIm Robbins) and who he becomes friends with.the movie then chronicles their friendship and struggles in the prison system.unlike ""The Green Mile"",there is no mystical or supernatural element to this film.however,this film is of the same calibre of ""Mile"",owing to its solid writing, acting, and direction.""Shawshank"" is very dramatic,yet very compelling.it's also a very moving tale.it will likely impact you emotionally and intellectually. and before i forget,i must also mention the ending,which i thought was very strong.for me,""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a strong 10/10",positive,10,tt0111161

I'm pretty sure a movie 15 years old everyone knows what it's about but I have to say Heath Ledger is rightly known as one of the best villains if not best cinematic performances ever, every single time he was on screen I was immersed, all these years later I still am blown away by him. The story has a perfect rhythm, something big happens then a lul and bang straight back in it, also every choice in this movie has an effect, Batman is being pushed to his bounds mentally, the joker has no motive, nothing to fight for, he just wants anarchy, Batman must overcome this and figure out a way to put this lunatic behind bars. This movie is truly one of the best out there, lately being compared to The Batman 2022 and they are both so different, you just can't compare as they are both in a calibre of their own ! 9/10.",positive,9,tt0468569
"In my opinion this is undoubtably one of the best and one my favourite films ever made. What is surprising as anything is that two years it was followed by Part II which is just as good (and then 20 years later and money-grabbing, dull and unnecessary third film). The first time I watched this film, I thought it was very good but overly long. But the second time I watched it, it didn't seem overly long at all, but beautifully detailed and concise - despite being nearly three hours long. I didn't find myself become bored, because the remarkable thing about this film is that almost every line, ever scene adds to the story or unfolding the characters, and their interaction with each other. The acting is believable, the direction is superb, and cinematography excellent. As well as all this, the film avoids cliches and over-dramatising deaths, but instead shows the Italian culture and strong importance of relations with your family. The differemt characters seem to perfectly gel. Micheal who changes from being relatively uninvolved ('a citizen') to heading the family, Sonny -overly volatile, Fredo - not clever enough (he's more involved in the 2nd film), and Tom - the level headed, sensible lawyer, who doesn't let his emotions run away with him like the others. My only (slight) criticism of the film, is that the Scilly scenes didn't run as smoothly as the rest of the film. Although it was interesting to see where family orginates from (again the 2nd film covers this more), Micheals falling in love and then his newly-weds' death seem a little unrealistic. Well in didn't make as well sense to me in a way. In summary this is a brilliantly detailed and enjoyable film, if not as 'entertaining' as Armaggedon (supposedly) or other rubbish.  I can see how this film wouldn't be for all tastes, but anyone interested in the more 'classic' style which people remember for years to come, as well as the storyline, this is a MUST see. Also note its a good idea to watch Godfather Part II shortly afterwards, while Part I is still fresh in the mind, as they link together brillantly. 10/10",positive,10,tt0068646
"""Fight Club"" is a masterpiece of modern cinema that offers an extraordinary experience with its unique narrative structure and provocative content. Based on the novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk, the film captivates the viewer from start to finish, leaving a lasting impression. Director David Fincher masterfully captures the darkness and chaos of the human mind on screen. The performances by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are brilliant, and their chemistry is electrifying. Their portrayal of split personalities and the desire to rebel against society's superficial consumerism is compelling and convincing. The plot of ""Fight Club"" is full of unexpected twists and subtle hints that constantly make the viewer reinterpret what is happening. The film encourages contemplation on identity, conformity, and the impact of capitalism, leaving room for various interpretations. The visual style of the film is impressive. The dark atmosphere, powerful compositions, and masterful cinematography enhance the intensity of the story. The film's music, including the iconic soundtrack by The Dust Brothers, contributes to the overall effect and seamlessly integrates with the narrative. ""Fight Club"" is a bold, daring, and intelligent film that challenges the conventions of mainstream cinema. It is not for everyone, but for those who embrace its unconventional storytelling, it offers a profound and unforgettable experience. With its outstanding performances, thought-provoking message, and technical brilliance, ""Fight Club"" deserves a rating of 10/10.",positive,10,tt0137523

It's so incredibly bad that when I first watched this I thought it was a comedy movie filmed as a parody of the whole sci-fi genre. When I was told that it's actually a serious movie intended for serious audiences I couldn't believe it. This movie is so bad that it made me lose my faith in humanity altogether. Then I realized that the problem is actually with me. I am simply not stupid enough to enjoy this movie. This movie requires you to be exceptionally stupid to enjoy and I don't fall into this category. If I had a lobotomy and had 80% of my brain removed I might have enjoyed this move and gave it a 10/10 like many people here did but I have all of my brain intact so I can't enjoy this movie.

"There never has been a movie like ""Fight Club"" before and there never will be again. ""Fight Club"" is a great movie mixture of a great story, acting and style. Movies that have all those elements are rare and often a great and one of a kind movie. Director David Fincher's directing works effective. It gives the movie both style and substance with a lot of depth. The story makes you want to see the movie over and over again, so you can understand and discover some more things on every viewing. Both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt do a great acting job, although I probably wouldn't have picked Pitt as a leading character. His role comes too soon after his in ""Twelve Monkeys"", both the movie and his character show resemblances. Meat Loaf has a fun role as Bob with the big man-breasts. The story is way more different than you would most likely expect. When you are first watching this movie you expect it to be a fight movie with street boxing. This is not the case, ""Fight Club"" is a personal movie in which the main focus lies on the main character and the anti-society message much like in Kubrick's movies was the case. Highly recommendable movie, although not a classic or masterpiece in my book. 9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",positive,9,tt0137523
"As often with a famous franchise, there's good films and there's bad films. This one just isnt very good. The special effects are great, the acting is mostly good and the director had some fine ideas. Cinematography is good although obviously mostly CGI. Sound design is cool so why the bad score? All these things just can't make up for this boring convoluded yet extremely clichéd plot. It lacks the fun of the previous avengers films and the pacing could be better as well. All in all, Its technically a great film, however, it's not a fun ride unless you turn your brain completely off - which should never be a demand for seeing a movie. It's a shame really; I love superhero films but some are good and some are just painfully overhyped by fanboys... and that's coming from a fanboy.

"""This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time."" Do you ever feel like that? Do you ever feel bored with life? Frustrated with your job and the people around you? Do you ever feel like you've wasted your precious time on this Earth? Do you ever feel like you can't feel at all? Well, ""Fight Club"" is the movie for you. Many (who haven't seen the film) seem to be under the impression that ""Fight Club"" is a big, dumb, brutish, excessively violent guy movie about some kind of brutal kick-boxing club. This couldn't be further from the truth. Here's the real plot: Our unnamed protagonist and narrator (Norton) is a man who hates his job and everything around him (Sound familiar?). He has a crippling case of insomnia which he can't seem to cure. He is a zero in a vast sea of electronic digits. Then he meets the enigmatic Tyler Durden (Pitt), a hip, confident funk song of a man; in other words: everything our narrator isn't. After a rather unfortunate event, he comes to live with Durden, and the two inadvertently become the founders of a club for disaffected men to take out their frustrations on each other. But eventually, Durden injects his own twisted ideals into ""fight club"" and it becomes something much larger and important. It also becomes a nightmare for our protagonist. By the way, wondering why the narrator goes unnamed through the entire film? My guess would be to stress the impersonality of the modern age. At first glance, it may seem like these men hurt each other because they are nothing but raging piles testosterone with nothing better to do. While this may play a minor role in their actions, the main reason they fight is because they are victims. Victims of the age of computers, credit cards, and Starbucks. They fight because they feel nothing and they want, long, and need to feel something, anything. They relish inflicting pain. They relish receiving pain. They relish the fact that they can feel. But don't be fooled and think that this is a depressing, unrelentingly serious film about deprived individuals; ""Fight Club"" is as much a comedy as a drama or a thriller. I actually found myself raucously guffawing on more than several occasions throughout the 2+ hour running time. The film is beautifully photographed and masterfully directed by David Fincher, who drenches the film in his wonderfully original and fantastically stylish approach, but the style is not a gimmick to cover up a shoddy film; it works. It works perfectly. Fincher has always had a strong visual flair, and ""Fight Club"" may be his most aesthetically interesting film yet. The film also features some fantastic acting, principally from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. Norton gives a dead-on performance as the frustrated every-man, and Pitt gives a very spirited performance as Durden, who may just be the biggest celluloid badass since Clint Eastwood's ""The Man With No Name"". Helena Bonham Carter is also notable as the only prominent female character in the film. Another strong contributing element of the movie is the fun soundtrack. The film's instrumental hip-hop/techno score, courtesy of The Dust Brothers, really enhances the experience; I can't imagine the movie without it. And as a personal plus, the film uses two of my favorite songs of all time: ""Goin' Out West"" by Tom Waits and ""Where Is My Mind?"" by Pixies (which are both utilized perfectly). But what is probably the most fascinating aspect of ""Fight Club"" is the way it dissects the psyche of a mentally unsound individual. But you will know what I'm talking about when you see the movie, I won't spoil it for you. Also, don't be fooled by the critics who condemn the film for being overly violent and graphic. I quite simply do not understand this claim. There are a few brutal fight scenes and maybe two gun-wounds. It is not excessive or graphic. It is necessary to the plot. ""Fight Club"" is not about action. ""Fight Club"" is not about convention. ""Fight Club"" is not about brutality. ""Fight Club"" is about the adverse effects of our modern dystopia. ""Fight Club"" is about enlightenment. But most importantly, ""Fight Club"" is about rebellious, impeccable, and thoroughly entertaining film-making. ""Fight Club"" is a modern masterpiece. 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0137523

"OK - since the movie is definately NOT the Two Towers (outside of the same character names and the fact there is a ring involved), the movie really needs to be seen without the Tolkien fanatics with rose-colour glasses. The movie STUNK! The acting was sub-standard (Gandalf 'fighting' with Saruman through Theoden was hysterically bad!). The plot was only loosely put together - actions of characters seem to come from nowhere (Merry standing up to Fangorn, Samwise's preaching, Aragorn's 'issues'). The actions of the characters were just bad, the fighting scenes - although spectacular in vision, were just sadly portrayed (Aragorn and Gimli 'jumping' into the middle of dozens of orcs and not getting scratched, horses ridding into the middle of 10,000 orcs and not one of the orcs seems capable of killing the horses, horses riding into 'swiss pikes' and not getting a scratch?????) on the good side - the cinematography was PHENOMINAL; the CGI is some of the best in movies today (you could barely tell gollum was not real); the orcs siege warfare was historically accurate (the use of ladders with people on them; the breaching of the walls; the use of the rams and it's security - very well done). Overall - movie 1/10; visual and historical 10/10 (but final rating must still be 1/10 - just a poorly done story).",negative,1,tt0167261
"and it wasn't quite what I expected, but that was okay.  The movie knocked me out of my socks, I felt it was a well acted, well directed story that created real interest in the characters.  Actually I was disappointed when the movie ended, not because of the way it ended just that it did, I wanted it to keep going.  That said there was room for improvement.  The army that was built, and their mission seemed a bit out of place, but did match the left field approach to life that is Tyler's existence, however it didn't really fix.  At least not as the director showed us the story. I would recommend seeing this.  The blood and violence, you see it all in the commercials, the story is left to be discovered as you watch the movie.

"Pros: Special effects, directing, sets, script, score, acting. Cons: A bit slow at times, pacing problems. There is probably a million reviews of Star Wars floating on the web so one more isn't going to make a difference. Still, I'll add my little insignificant bitof o[inion of this movie. It is a classic movie, no doubt but surprisingly not the best in the series. Most fans seem to think the title belongs to The Empire Strikes Back and I agree with them. The film starts with a rebel ship trying to escape a epublic battleship to to no success. Princess Leia is onboard and she has structural plans of the infamous Death Star. Fearing capture, she transmits her info to R2-D2, a droid and also a message to Ben Kenobi. R2-D2 and along with C-3P0 escape through the use of an escape pod and they land on Tatooine, a desert planet. From there an epic journey begins involving different characters of all sorts. The robots provide much of the comic relief and Han Solo's biting sarcastic remarks are a riot to witness. His interactions with Chewbacca and Princess Leia provide for the funniest parts of the movie. The movie ultimately suffers because it seems a bit slow at times. For example, a lot of time is spent on the capture of the droids by the sandpeople and the eventual selling of them to Owen Lars. I felt this could be sped up a bit. The film finishes epic in scale and equally impressive with the use of digital effects. It is easy to see why this film became a landmark to its generation. Premise: A rebellion threatens to knock out the Death Star, the most powerful weapon in the universe. Star Wars Episode 1: A New Hope was nominated for eleven Academy awards and won seven. Grade: 9.5/10 (One of the best Science Fiction films ever made).",neutral,5,tt0076759
"I can't believe big names they gathered for this kind of movie. Completely sick, I cannot come to my senses after what I've just watched.

"The problem with a film so synonymous with a shocking twist or an ending reveal is that there isn't much value to re-watching such a film. Sure, there are plenty of good things about The Sixth Sense, but I can't help but think without the famous twist, this movie would have been just your average thriller. Being a huge film fan, it was always hard admitting that I haven't seen M. Night Shyamalan's ""masterpiece"", The Sixth Sense. But because I've known the twist for years now, I had a difficult time mustering up the motivation to watch a film knowing its ending. I can't stand knowing endings going into the viewing experience. With that said, there are a lot of things about this film that are good, so I'm mad at myself for taking so long. But also keeping that in mind, I hardly believe this film was best picture quality, nor deserves to be on ""all-time great"" lists. Besides the twist, The Sixth Sense is perhaps most notable for being the coming out party for Haley Joel Osment, who plays a child with the ability to see and speak to the newly perished. He, Toni Collette, and Bruce Willis are the best things about this film. The performances alone make it worth the price of admission, with Collette being the clear standout for me. And Willis perhaps hasn't given as good of a performance since. The problem for me is that knowing the twist going in really tramples any sort of enjoyment I had. The ""thrills"" weren't all that thrilling and the plot seemed to never truly pick up pace until it was too late. That falls on the shoulders of Shyamalan and his directing. I feel like people were so enthralled with the late-game revelation, that they forgot how plotting the first hour and a half feels. There's a lot here I liked, but it's nowhere near the high praise that people give it. +Performances carry the film +Emotional connection is felt towards the end -Plot drags -No re-watchability 6.4/10",negative,4,tt0167404
"The Dark Knight, a cinematic masterpiece that plunged me into the shadows of Gotham with an exhilarating mix of chaos and brilliance. Heath Ledger's Joker is a chilling revelation, a performance that dances on the edge of anarchy and elevates the film to iconic status. The film editing is a symphony of suspense, seamlessly weaving together the moral dilemmas faced by Christian Bale's brooding Batman and the chaotic plans of Ledger's Joker. Strengths? A gripping narrative that explores the thin line between hero and villain, and the complex psychology of a city in the grip of darkness. Weaknesses? Some might find the film's runtime a tad long, but every minute is a captivating descent into Gotham's heart of darkness. Hans Zimmer's score is the pulse of the film, echoing the heartbeat of a city on the brink. Cinematography paints Gotham in shades of noir, capturing the gritty realism of the world Christopher Nolan crafted. The message? A haunting exploration of the consequences of choice and the relentless pursuit of justice in the face of madness. 8/10 is a Bat-Signal in the sky for its brilliance, a film that not only redefined the superhero genre but left an indelible mark on cinema itself.",positive,8,tt0468569

The director caught our attention by this continuous flash back style, but most of us failed to get it all! We all know that Guy was after the killer of his wife. That's all.

"Alden Ehrenreich doesn't have the charm Harrison Ford had as Han Solo, but Donald Glover nailed Lando. The ending kinda seemed all over the place.

There were a few moments that got me in the feels though, mostly hearing some familiar themes in the score when the main characters are in the Millennium Falcon's cockpit. The few Easter eggs and call backs to the original series were recognized and appreciated as well. Don't think the movie deserves the hate it's received, but it's definitely not perfect.

"Gone is the time when an aloof and mysterious character like Han Solo can stand on his own. When the pure imagination of fans opened up countless debates on how the Kessel run really went down, or how Hans eventually won the Millennium Falcon and eventually became a staple of his character. The hard truth is, fans and casual viewers already knew these milestones in Han's story happened and will happen, so the only thing that mattered about this movie was, how was it going to happen? For awhile, the magic of Star Wars was that of not knowing what to expect and getting to analyze an entire lived-in universe by yourself or with your friends throughout the years. With Solo, that magic is lost. You know you will be dealing with limited stakes since Solo and Chewie are pretty much okay and surely alive after this movie. You know that it will hit the basic story beats of how he becomes an outlaw, a rebel and eventually the iconic smuggler with a secret heart of gold we all know and love. You know he'll get the Falcon, you know he'll end up with Leia anyway. There's no mystery here, everyone knows the answer and we're all left with awkward suspicions about how things will play out. Alden Ehrenreich does a, for the most part, fantastic job as Han Solo and he makes the role his own, probably one of the better parts of this movie. Lando (Donald Glover) and Chewie both get their moments, and also stand out in their roles. Beckett (Woody Harrelson) and Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke) weirdly fall flat as the new additions for Solo, aside from an obvious wisecracking droid to entertain us and give us some emotional moments, the two side characters that are meant to be the people that influence the title character are bland and uninteresting. Beckett seems to be just a ticket for Han to go follow him wherever he goes only to just ride backseat in the mission in the end. While Qi'ra plays the love interest of Han who we never get to know much about aside from pointless and explicit exposition. She also has a vague and messy arc that makes not just Han, but the audience confused as well. At one point, you're not sure where her allegiance lies, what her motivations are and what drives her to stick or stay away from Han. Moreover, the story really doesn't aim to tell a properly structured narrative, instead it felt like a ""Han's Biggest Hits Montage"" all through out. Now this is not to say that it's hard and impossible to tell a proper movie about iconic persons/events we probably know about and/or have learned about and theorized ourselves. Rogue One (2016) was able to do it to an admittedly better extent, and quite masterfully in the James Bond reboot with Casino Royale back in 2006. To use Casino Royale as an example, it's a perfect story that shows how James Bond became THE James Bond we know and love, the commanding, suave and rough 007 agent. When the movie starts, he's not yet quite the Bond we're used to know yet, but what happens in that film contributes to why he changes. Then in the end, that's the only time we get the iconic line of James Bond introducing himself because that character has earned it through the context of the film. 
 While Solo tried to achieve this same level of success, it falls hard on its knees really hard in the process. The definition of ""context"" the filmmakers had in mind with Solo was just throwing in fan service after fan service of what made Han Solo iconic, but we never really see why THIS character in THIS film in particular earned that iconic status. Han is basically the same person from the beginning till the end, compare this to James Bond in Casino Royale wherein his relationship with Vesper and how it ended changed his character forever, inevitably giving strong emotional and narrative context as to why he became how he is. This is never explored in the film and it instead becomes a by-the-numbers, monotone, and dull looking film. Verdict: 6/10",neutral,6,tt3778644
"I watched this film last night because I heard Kanye West once said that it was an all time classic. Now I do respect the rapper and producer's opinion but I beg to differ. Firstly I found it quite boring, it just doesn't have the action packed pace of some of my personal favourite movies such as Weekend at Bernie's 2, Teen Wolf, or Kickboxer 3 : The Art of War. The acting wasn't great either. I know Pacino and Brando are decent actors but compared to performances such as Judd Nelson in The Breakfast Club or Rodney Dangerfield in Caddyshack, it's seriously under par. It's easy to play a moody gangster but could you imagine Al Pacino playing Ross Geller in Friends? Me neither. The guy has no versatility. One more thing is the music wasn't too hot either. Just classical nonsense all the way through. By my calculations, The Godfather would be 37% better if there was a tad more Genesis, maybe ""Invisible Touch"" playing over the restaurant shooting scene. 3/10. Cheers.",negative,3,tt0068646

I did have a problem with Katie Holmes. she just seemed too young for an assistant DA and lacked the vigor needed in the character. This could have been a good movie, the first serious, real look at Batman. It was very true to the character but there were too many villains.

"The Matrix was better than expected. I was hooked on the intriguing storyline and surprisingly, the exposition never bored me and always kept me interested; however, the same cannot be said about other scenes without exposition, which were either full of emotionless dialogue and silly, over-the-top action sequences. I was disappointed with the acting in this movie; Keanu Reeves was somewhat bland and uninteresting. I did not feel that Neo and Trinity had any chemistry whatsoever, however Laurence Fishburne was great as Morpheus, and Hugo Weaving was excellent at portraying a menacing villain. As I have said before, the action in this movie was extremely silly. I especially disliked the helicopter shooting scene because of the water and the shots of falling bullets which were completely unnecessary; I also disliked the overuse of slow-mo in this movie. I also felt that the movie had very awkward and abrupt transitions; the ending also felt abrupt to me. The score in this movie was great most of the time, however some pieces of music which were used in some action scenes were possibly even worse than the modern Hans Zimmer approach to film music, and it even got on my nerves. Overall, this movie has quite a few problems, but the enrapturing plot managed to hook me enough to give this movie a 6/10; it was better than I expected.",neutral,6,tt0133093
"I fell asleep twice, on two separate occasions trying to make it through this movie. I won't be too critical of it as it may simply just not be my bag, but I did expect more. The concept is fantastic, all filmed on GoPro cameras with several different stunt men, it really does contain some impressive stunts. The effects are also very good and the overall finish is very crisp and professional looking. I wasn't too excited about it being filmed like a video game, by this I mean the dialogue scenes. The script and interactions between the people is very video game esc. Before too long though the uniqueness wore off and I became bored. The way in which it is filmed genuinely gave me motion sickness and I had to look away on several occasions. Some of the action scenes were far too shaky to watch and I think they could have smoothed it out and still kept the realistic first person viewing. The villain was mediocre at best and was of little interest. Due to my lack of being able to stay awake I cannot comment on the plot as I don't remember it at all; however it obviously wasn't gripping enough to keep me awake. As I said earlier, it was an interesting concept, well created and I imagine if FPS video games are your passion then you would appreciate this movie more than I did.

"Now, believe me when I say, Fight Club is hands down one of the most complex, thematically-rich films of the 90s. It's this decade's most profound piece of movie making as well as being one of this decade's most original. Unfortunately, due to its uniqueness, an audience will be hard to pinpoint. The same target audience that it speaks to also might not understand its deep-seated themes. Fight Club is one of those rare films that has so much to say that one viewing will not be able to absorb all of it. The acting is superb and enviable. All of the characters in the movie have something to say that adds to the development of the story. The camera work and graphics are outstanding. The effects are useful at grabbing the viewer's attention. As I said earlier, this movie is truly unique. It's not a corny underdog story about some man fighting to get a girl or prove a point. But it is the uprising of one particular class of underlying men who feel they are ""the middle child of god"". Fight club relies on it's wit, shock value and dialogue to create a controversial atmosphere that holds the viewer's attention.

"If there's one movie I'd recommend to anyone, it's The Shawshank Redemption. This film is the perfect example of storytelling done right. It's emotional, gripping, and leaves you thinking about it long after the credits roll. Honestly, it's a solid 10/10 in my book. The story revolves around Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is wrongly imprisoned for the murder of his wife. What follows is a tale of resilience, friendship, and hope in the bleakest of circumstances. Morgan Freeman as Red, the narrator and Andy's closest friend in Shawshank, delivers one of the most iconic performances ever. His voice alone could carry the entire movie, but paired with his acting, it's pure gold. What really sets this film apart is its pacing and attention to detail. Every scene feels purposeful, and the way the plot unfolds keeps you hooked. The bond between Andy and Red is so well-developed that you feel their highs and lows as if they were your own. And the ending? It's one of the most satisfying conclusions ever, a perfect payoff for the journey you've just been taken on. Beyond the incredible acting and plot, the film has a deeper message about the power of hope and perseverance. It shows how even in the darkest times, the human spirit can shine through. The dialogue is unforgettable (who doesn't love the ""Get busy living or get busy dying"" line?), and the cinematography is stunning, especially considering it was made in the 90s. If you haven't watched it yet, do yourself a favor and make it your next movie night pick. It's not just a film; it's an experience.",positive,10,tt0111161

"""The Shawshank Redemption"" stands as a cinematic masterpiece, weaving a tapestry of emotions, resilience, and redemption that resonates with audiences on a profound level. Released in 1994 and directed by Frank Darabont, this film has not only stood the test of time but has also solidified its place in the annals of cinema as one of the greatest works ever created. At its core, the film is an adaptation of Stephen King's novella, ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption."" The narrative unfolds within the walls of Shawshank State Penitentiary, where Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) finds himself serving a life sentence for a crime he vehemently denies committing. The plot meticulously navigates the harsh realities of prison life, exploring themes of friendship, institutionalization, and the indomitable human spirit. One of the film's most striking features is its impeccable storytelling. Darabont crafts a narrative that is both intricate and accessible, allowing viewers to connect with the characters on a deeply personal level. The storytelling is layered, with multiple threads weaving seamlessly together. The use of voiceover narration, delivered by Red (Morgan Freeman), adds a contemplative and reflective dimension, enhancing the emotional impact of the story. The film's pacing is another noteworthy aspect. Darabont takes his time to establish the characters and the prison environment, allowing the audience to become fully immersed in the world of Shawshank. The deliberate pacing also serves to heighten the impact of key moments, creating a visceral experience for the viewer. The film's nearly two-and-a-half-hour runtime feels justified as every scene contributes meaningfully to the overall narrative. Central to the film's success is the stellar performances of its cast. Tim Robbins delivers a nuanced portrayal of Andy Dufresne, capturing the character's quiet strength and unwavering determination. Morgan Freeman's performance as Red is equally remarkable, providing the film with its soul through his poignant narration and portrayal of a seasoned inmate with a keen understanding of the prison's dynamics. The supporting cast, including William Sadler as Heywood, Bob Gunton as the oppressive Warden Norton, and Clancy Brown as the menacing Captain Hadley, contribute to the film's authenticity. Each actor brings depth to their characters, making them more than mere archetypes and allowing the audience to empathize with their struggles and triumphs. The cinematography, spearheaded by Roger Deakins, is nothing short of breathtaking. The visual composition of each frame is meticulously crafted, enhancing the emotional resonance of the narrative. The use of light and shadow is particularly noteworthy, symbolizing hope and despair respectively. From the sweeping shots of the prison yard to the intimate moments in Andy's cell, every scene is a visual feast that complements the storytelling. Thomas Newman's evocative score further elevates the film. The music seamlessly weaves through the narrative, underscoring the emotional beats with precision. The now-iconic theme, ""Shawshank Redemption,"" has become synonymous with the film itself, evoking a range of emotions from nostalgia to inspiration. Beyond its technical brilliance, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a film with a profound message. At its core, it is a tale of resilience and the enduring power of hope. Andy's relentless pursuit of knowledge and self-improvement, even within the confines of Shawshank, serves as a testament to the human spirit's capacity to transcend adversity. The film inspires introspection, urging viewers to reflect on their own lives and the choices that define them. The theme of friendship is woven throughout the narrative, primarily through the bond between Andy and Red. This relationship serves as the emotional anchor of the film, illustrating how genuine connections can provide solace and strength even in the bleakest of circumstances. The camaraderie among the inmates, forged through shared hardship, adds another layer of depth to the film's exploration of human relationships. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" also serves as a poignant critique of the prison system and the dehumanizing effects of institutionalization. Through the lens of Andy's experiences, the film sheds light on the arbitrary nature of justice and the challenges faced by those within the system. The corrupt practices within Shawshank, epitomized by Warden Norton, highlight the moral ambiguity that can permeate positions of authority. Furthermore, the film tackles themes of redemption and forgiveness. As the title suggests, Shawshank becomes a metaphorical crucible for redemption, where characters grapple with their past actions and seek a path to personal salvation. The conclusion of the film is a testament to the transformative power of redemption, offering a cathartic resolution that lingers in the minds of viewers long after the credits roll. In conclusion, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a cinematic triumph that transcends its prison setting to deliver a universal message of hope, friendship, and the indomitable nature of the human spirit. Through its masterful storytelling, exceptional performances, and profound themes, the film continues to resonate with audiences, earning its place as a timeless classic in the pantheon of great cinema.",positive,10,tt0111161
"To start off, this was an extremely controversial movie when it was released.Maybe because of the racist, anti-black, anti-immigration, anti-Jewish, anti-Asian, anti- Hispanic etc etc remarks made continuously in the movie. This movie is actually divided into two parts and has a non-linear style of narration. The two parts being the flashback and the current scenario. The director has interestingly given a different look to both the parts with the help of colors. The flashback is depicted by black and white frames while the current part is depicted by normal color. The movie contains violence, sometimes very gory violence that may turn your eyes off the screen. It contains some statements which you may not agree with. But as a movie, it is a complete experience. The transition of the protagonist from a racial, neo-nazi skinhead to a caring, understanding guy who understands that it is not the color that determines a person, but his nature is put very underminingly by the director. His urge to stop his brother from going his way and spoil his life is depicted wonderfully. The part of the story in jail where Norton understands that he is wrong and has a radical transformation was done without preaching and high melodrama which is the case with many other movies. On the acting front, Edward Norton is anyways one of my favorite actors and in this movie all his acting prowess is put to the test and without any surprise he delivers . All the other actors especially Edward Furlong fit the bill perfectly . In short Controversial but a must watch Rating : 8.5/10",neutral,5,tt0120586
"If ever a film could be described as too clever by half it is ""Memento"". An undoubtedly entertaining thriller about revenge, it is a technically accomplished film noir that is over- reliant on its dominating gimmick: its reverse storytelling structure. That gimmick cannot, however, conceal the impression that, while it is a good film, ""Memento"" is really no better than many other films of its kind. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, and based on a short story by Jonathan Nolan (any relation, I wonder?), ""Memento"" has all the accoutrements of classic film noir: a seedy California setting; seemingly lonely and emotionally disturbed characters; motels that exploit their customers; and murder as a pivotal part of the plot. It tells the story of Leonard (Guy Pearce), whose wife called him Lenny but who likes to be addressed by everyone else by his full first name. Leonard is an ex-insurance fraud investigator. He has short-term memory difficulties - he knows who he is and can recall everything about his life before the incident in which his wife was killed. However, he has been unable to make any new memories since that traumatic event. His failure to prevent the rape and murder of his wife, and a knock on the head that he sustained during that incident, have induced in him a sort of reverse amnesia and left him with a single-minded determination for revenge. Hampered by his inability to retain new information, Leonard resorts to having his body tattooed (by himself in some instances; by a professional tattooist in others) with vital pieces of information that will assist him in the search for his wife's killer. He also takes Polaroid photos and writes notes to himself as a means of recording other important details that will help him, e.g. the location of the motel at which he is staying. Leonard is aided (or perhaps thwarted?) in his efforts by Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), a barmaid with a dodgy boyfriend, and by the mysterious Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). Natalie is the classic femme fatale beloved of all such films! So, the basic plot - the need to avenge a terrible crime - is not particularly original. But the memory issue is. That, however, pales into insignificance when set beside the highly unusual structure of the narrative of the film. Time appears to move backwards and forwards in chunks in almost equal measure in a complex presentation of the chronology of events that is sometimes difficult to follow. The viewer needs all his wits and attentive powers about him to work out exactly what is going on and when. There is the added complication of a seemingly unimportant sub-plot concerning someone whom Leonard was investigating for possible insurance fraud before his wife's demise and who was apparently suffering the same memory difficulties that now plague Leonard. ""Memento"" is an absorbing and entertaining film. It is beautifully acted by all concerned. Guy Pearce is superb as Leonard. He appears in virtually every scene in the film. His performance is such that the viewer cares about him and his crusade to avenge his wife's death. The film is well directed. And it is skilfully edited, something that is crucial to the plausibility of the plot, given the film's unusual structure. The problem is though that ""Memento"" is at times overrun by a sense of cleverness, knowingness and pretentiousness. I have no idea why, for instance, a number of crucial scenes (they usually involve Leonard on the telephone to an unidentified policeman who seems to be providing him with unreliable information) are filmed in monochrome. And while the reverse chronology of the film is unusual it does not really enhance what I think is one of the main messages of the film: which is that memory is a tantalisingly fragile aspect of human life, and that what and whom we trust are governed by all sorts of things beyond our control. So what we have here is an entertaining and fascinating film noir that, for all its technical accomplishment and wizardry, is just that: an enjoyable, but ultimately forgettable, movie. 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0209144
"SPOILER FREE So I went to a special screening of TDK last night, it was pretty ******* okay. The Dark Knight is the best interpretation since Burton's films (or some might argue since Batman:The Animated Series.It's a fantastic film which succeeds in impressing but if you step back & think for 2 seconds, it's not perfect, still has many flaws but is still the best blockbuster in years. I just have to get it out of my system, Batman Begins sucked on a huge level for me, poor & underused villains, some miscasting, a long & very boring first half, & not enough Batman. The Dark Knight succeeds in all these areas this time the parallel opposite to BB villains, the Joker is both terrifying & unbelievably insane, there are moments when he shows his insanity, the cinema find it funny I didn't...half the time anyway, I saw a deranged psychopath with no moral compass. Harvey Dent, I don't care what people say but for me the films belongs to Harvey, it stayed true to his comic counterpart, actually it didn't but character wise it does stay very true to the source material, Aaron Eckhart puts in an extremely memorable performance (as did Ledger) as Harvey/Two Face. Should I talk more about the good like the awesomely cool chase sequence or the occasional glimpse of a great musical score which ends up being a tad OTT but still great, nope I'm gonna talk about the negative stuff. The Dark Knight is not the truest version of Batman, the Joker wears makeup, Dent's transformation into Two-Face has completely been changed, stupid Rachael is still in it, & the convenient set ups are bloody annoying. All these things are Nolan's fault, why cause he wants his vision set in the real world, excuse me I'm never seen the Batman comics ever try to be realistic, in TDK you feel he's taking this too far & that in the next film it will get ridiculous, wouldn't be surprised if the Riddler was turned into some super hacker. Nice to see how conveniently he can get a new suit in such short time (only the later campy Batman films were guilty of this) or just so happens to have a Bat-Pod come out from nowhere, which still looks ridiculous. Rachael is now played by a different actress (Maggie) who I'm a fan of which made her character that more interesting than Cruise's wife from BB but still they could of used one of the many women in Bruce's life from the comics (& no not Vicki Vale). I have a slight problem with two aspects of Nolan's films which are related...Bruce Wayne, Bale is not playing Bruce he's playing Batman all the time, not literally & yeah I know Batman's mask is Bruce, there is no depth to Bruce's character, by depth I mean in the film it wants to be, but compared to any other blockbuster its PERFECT. You feel no emotional connection to the things which affect Bruce's life, you see it affect Batman but not Bruce, if you get what I'm saying. And the second thing related to this is Bale, he plays Batman not Bruce, when's he's Bruce he never shows the depth of acting a actor should for playing this deeply scarred torn character, look at Keaton in the original films, his face did half the acting while he was Bruce & he showed the exact version of Bruce I have in my head, a tortured soul who just doesn't fit in & not Bale pretending to be this ass of a playboy isn't quite the same thing. Doesn't help when the only scene I felt anything for Bruce was when he was sulking in the chair, which was both brief & required almost zero acting skills mostly cause the camera wasn't focusing on Bruce but more on Alfred. I only connected to Gordon & Harvey Dent, but both of the actors who play them are two of my favourite actors. Minus those two I just felt emotional connection to the characters, yeah the Joker does things which cause people to get angry & upset but the film distanced itself from showing any emotional depth other than a few scenes most of which are Harvey/Gordon related. This is much more I can criticize especially being a serious Batman fan but I won't go into that since it will give big spoilers away & this review is getting long . How about some positive closing comments (two paragraphs I mean) . The Dark Knight is by no means a bad film nor an OK film nor a good film...no it's a fantastic film which just about meets my expectations. I still can't get over Bale's voice as Batman (deep voice) or some of the aspects of the villains but it makes up for it with a very well thought out script, occasional snippets of unique & original dialogue (all by the Joker & Dent), some much improved action sequences over BB, & a fitting but not entirely satisfying fan-boy ending but is well done nonetheless. But here's the thing it draws more on the detective aspect of Batman but oh shock it really isn't, Batman does almost zero detective work honestly. And the big thing is it's become a film...not a superhero film, Nolan has sucked everything out of Batman making it this realistic story of an outcast, which is fine, hell even great...no fantastic but it's not an accurate version of BATMAN that's why I give it a 9/10 (so close to giving it a 9.9/10) I've thought about all night & I just can't be like everybody else & give it a perfect 10 just cause it was fantastic, I just don't think it quite earned a perfect 10. I still like Batman Returns & '89 more, I believe Burton captured Batman & Bruce Wayne better than Nolan ever will.",positive,9,tt0468569
"I remember being 13 wanting to rent this movie at the videostore. I had to go back and get a permission slip from my mom or the guy wouldn't rent it to me. After I watched it as a 13-year old, I kinda understood. I'm 39 now and watched it again yesterday (although I still have it on dvd somewhere). I understand it better now. This movie is top 5 best movies for me. Edward Norton gives his best performance, better than all the movies he did later. The casting overall is superb. On an emotional level it hits harder now though. Maybe because nothing has changed. Still the same rhetoric, still the same problems. Or maybe I'm more empathetic this age. Maybe it's a midlife crisis who knows. Point being, this movie still very much holds up after 26 years, aged like fine wine even.

"Normally when I'm watching a foreign film with subtitles, it can be distracting. With The Intouchables, you never once even realize it has subtitles. It's by far one of the most charming films I have ever seen. The chemistry between Cluzet and Sy is incredible. It is hard to even come up with an issue with the film from top to bottom. It tells the story of an ex-con upbeat young man who is hired by a quadriplegic to be his caretaker and the bond they build over time. They both learn life lessons from each other but most of all they both enjoy life for what it is. Cluzet brings so much joy to a character who is in an unbearable situation. Sy learns to love the little things in life while developing a special bond with Cluzet and the rest of his aristocratic family. I do wish they showed a bit about how Sy rekindled his own family relationship or just stayed true to the real life story. I don't know exactly to what extent this film is fiction but that seemed to be the big complaint among critics. For me, it doesn't need to be a history lesson. A film is suppose to move you emotionally. Whether it's a comedy, thriller, or drama a film is to entertain. So I enjoyed the film for what it is, and that's a feel good film. The performances, music, and directing are all great and it's just a well made film.

"When first released, Fight Club was panned by most critics probably just because it was the safe thing to do.  Fight Club brings up many dangerous thoughts that might actually be true.  The film Fight Club is not only about the title club, it's also about a man's (Edward Norton) plunge into near insanity due to insomnia and can't seem to find a solution.  This was until he met the rebellious Tyler Durden.  Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is a man who is against everything that's materialistic and artificial.  This includes big business and models among other things.  Both men decide to come up with a club all men can work out their aggressions bearing the name Fight Club. Director David Fincher paints a dark and gritty film depicting a man's life spiraling out of control and the man who brings his life back into perspective (or so it seems).  The ending cannot be matched in sheer surprise.  Even ""The Sixth Sense"" cannot compare.  This movie requires repeat viewings and IMO is second to only ""The Matrix"" for the year 1999 . 9/10",positive,9,tt0137523
"This film changed my perspective on life, from the first time I experienced it when I was 13 years old to still rewatching it at 27. It only makes me rethink of my purpose, the current consumerist society we are a part of, and the core meaning of the human experience. To claim greatest film of all time would be outrageous. So I'm gonna claim top 5 of all time, in no particular order. This ""film"" is beyond a film. It explores the emasculation of western men, it's an anti-capitalist creed, it's a satire on societal norms, it's the void of not being able to find a purpose. It explores and showcases insomnia, loneliness, repetition, anxiety, identity disorder, the mega corporations, nihilism, grudge, violence, cults, toxic masculinity, hero-worship, hyper masculinity, detachment, ego death, sacrifice, enlightenment. The list truthfully goes on. It critics postmodern society in a subliminal way just so intensely. As always, for the first time viewer, you think; the entire film entails a bunch of disappointed men who take out their anger in a underground ""fight club"". I've watched this film over 30 times and I still don't know the full meaning. You can elaborate a new meaning every time you rewatch it. Masterpiece 10/10.",positive,10,tt0137523
"This is really a great movie! Until now, I've never thought much of Brad Pitt as an actor, but as Tyler Durden, in this movie he shows what he can do. So did Edward Norton as some Average Joe with no life, Bonham Carter as Marla Singer who've I've seen before in Howard's End, another movie I like and I recall she performed very well. But now about this movie . . . It was pure brilliance. Imagine yourself living a dull boring life as a nobody, feeling life is passing you by as many of us have at some time. Be careful, you might do as this Average Joe and find through a most peculiar way an alter ego that is everything that you are not, but something you cannot control and something that can become more powerful and more dangerous than anything you could have ever imagined. Be careful! I won't go further with this! There is not much more that I can say without depriving you of this experience of losing yourself in the mazes that this movie took me. This movie will overtake you, it will exceed your ability to outwit and figure out where it is taking you and how it is taking you it is taking you there and why. It will take you as it does this sorry nobody. So I won't go further. Just see this movie and discover a nightmare, though so amusing at times you will roll on the floor laughing, as this movie is not without thought provoking and most profound of humor. Unlike comedies, this movie doesn't struggle or aim for laughs, the situations render themselves fertile grounds for them. This movie has no equals. It is a one of a kind. It's unlikely they'll make another one like it. Enjoy it. The best! My rating 10/10.",positive,10,tt0137523
"What if the greatest battle you fight isn't with the world around you, but with yourself? Fight Club, directed by David Fincher, dives headfirst into this question, crafting one of the most daring and thought-provoking films of modern cinema. Fight Club (1999), directed by David Fincher and adapted from Chuck Palahniuk's novel, remains one of the most provocative and influential films of its era. On the surface, it is a story about an unnamed narrator (Edward Norton) who forms an underground fight club with the enigmatic Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). But beneath the violence and chaos lies a razor-sharp critique of consumerism, masculinity, and identity in the late 20th century. The film's greatest strength is its layered narrative. Fincher constructs a story that works as both visceral entertainment and intellectual puzzle. Norton's performance perfectly captures the quiet desperation of modern alienation, while Pitt embodies raw charisma and rebellion. Helena Bonham Carter, as Marla Singer, adds complexity, serving as both a destabilizing force and an emotional anchor. Visually, the film is a triumph. Fincher's meticulous direction-combined with gritty cinematography and stylized editing-creates a surreal yet immersive atmosphere. The use of subliminal cuts and disorienting sequences foreshadows the film's iconic plot twist, which remains one of the most shocking and effective in cinema history. Far from being a gimmick, the twist redefines the entire narrative, forcing viewers to question what is real and what is illusion. Beyond its shock value, Fight Club resonates because of its thematic depth. It interrogates the emptiness of consumer culture, the fragility of identity, and the allure of self-destruction. Its controversial message-often misinterpreted-challenges audiences to think critically rather than accept easy answers. Summary: Bold, unsettling, and brilliantly crafted, Fight Club delivers not only the best plot twist of its generation but also a searing cultural critique that remains relevant today.

Edward Norton (Jack) is an insomniac who seeks solace in joining help groups for cancer, blood disorders, etc. and his addiction for them grows the more he attends. That is until he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and they form their own help group (FIGHT CLUB) where grown men can join and beat each other up to forget their troubles. And so an underground sect is formed, as Jack and Tyler's ideas spread like the plague, Jack soon realises that all is not quite what it seems.

"Well, I'm not gonna do the long complicated-relationship-intro about Nolan's body of work and my experience with it, since I kind of already did that in my review for Batman Begins. I will, though, give a little background for this trilogy before diving into this particular film. The Dark Knight trilogy is one of the most loved and appreciated film trilogies of all time - it's super popular, very critically acclaimed, and one can definitely claim it had changed the face of mainstream cinema. The first of the three movies, Batman Begins, wasn't too bad in my opinion, but it wasn't very good either. My expectations going into this one, though, were a lot higher, considering the fact that it's often considered to be the best of the trilogy by FAR, and that it's so high up the IMDb poster. So, yeah, let's dive into it. The Dark Knight is the second movie of Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. It came out in 2008, and it follows Batman, a good amount of time after the events of the previous movie. Gotham nowadays looks different than it used to - criminals keep their eyes on the sky, looking for the Bat Signal, fearful, on guard. The mob bosses turn to more and more extreme measures, trying to ensure their income, unwilling to give in even in Batman's city, and the war on crime is constant and bloody. Batman's abilities are put to the ultimate test when a new criminal shows in town, one who goes by the name Joker, causing mayhem with his twisted schemes, more or less declaring an all-out war, a personal crusade against Batman and everything he represents. Will Batman manage to defeat this laughing agent of chaos? Now, the previous movie, Batman Begins, had me not quite invested, was rather stale pacing-wise, and never really had a grip on me. I feel like much of it is because the main villain, Ra's Al Ghul, wasn't really well-written or interesting, so most of the movie felt like there were little to no stakes, no conflict to pull us in. There's a gap there, between Nolan's intentions and my actual feelings. On The Dark Knight, though, comes a much more unique villain, that is far more gripping - Joker. The conflict he has with Batman drives the movie forward in a very solid way - despite being a pretty long movie, the conflict between Batman and the Joker makes this movie so much tighter. I've talked about it before, when reviewing The Lord of the Rings trilogy, where the second movie is way better than the third, in my opinion, mainly because there is more conflict, which means more urgency and drive, more themes explored. Right from the start of the movie we're introduced to Joker's convoluted schemes, to his madness, his ruthless behavior. He somehow manages to fool everyone in twisted, dark, maniacal ways, always one step ahead of the good guys. And the thing with this movie having some good conflicts, besides making us more invested and improving the pacing, is that it manages to make Batman, or this version of him, anyway, into a better character, simply by the nature of this conflict. Christian Bale's Batman is quite a shallow, boring depiction of the caped crusader, but here he's pushed to his limits, toyed with, being attacked in the way that hurts him most every single time. When conflict is forcing him to make tough decisions, character is revealed, and we get to know him in a much deeper way, compared to the previous movie. Definitely an improvement there, I'd say. Despite being a vigilante, Batman is all about order - his no killing rule, his attempts to balance the city, his belief in humanity's inherent goodness. Look how he tried to convince Ra's not to destroy the city on the previous movie, for instance, and how it showcases this ideology of his. Joker, on the other hand, holds the exact opposite view - that people are selfish, animalistic, only good when life allows them to be. The Joker isn't only in an all-out war against Batman, but he's in a war against what Batman represents, which makes this movie way more interesting, adding this theme of selfish vs selfless, inherent good or inherent evil, the choices we make when cornered and how our morals can shatter when we're pushed to the edge. Reminds me a lot of Se7en, which is an obvious inspiration to this movie, but I feel like this theme is explored here in a way that doesn't make The Dark Knight feel like an attempt to recreate or copy Se7en. It definitely does its own thing. The Joker's evilness is shown through the wicked games he plays, the ways he finds so much enjoyment in killing, his disregard to human life, the casualness with which he kills. We're not only invested because of this conflict between order, good, the idea of humanity being worth saving, against the antithesis of that - chaos, mayhem, death. We're invested because while Ra's tries to eliminate a city without us really being invested (supposed high stakes, though it's hard to have deep feelings for a whole city we don't know much about), the Joker uses knives because he wants to FEEL it. He enjoys it. He's way more manipulative and cruel then Ra's, and much less predictable. Each of his little games is quite memorable, and besides pushing the movie forward, it's just good storytelling, for the most part. He's so fun, theatrical, kind of thirsty for the world's attention, using people as mere pawns, making it way more personal than Ra's did. It's not about the amount of people dying, but about the terror, the mind games, the cruelty, something that many blockbusters fail to understand. Heath Ledger, who had sadly passed away before the movie came out, is the most notable addition to the cast here, and though I haven't seen him anywhere else, you can tell how deep into this role he got here, especially hearing stories regarding the ways he immersed himself in it, isolated to find the perfect body language to portray The Joker, including gestures and voice and all. This portrayal of Joker is very iconic and well-known for a good reason. Aaron Eckhart also does a decent job as Harvey Dent, though I do have some criticism regarding his storyline, which I'll get to later. Maggie Gyllenhaal is much better as Rachel than Katie Holmes was, and I was even invested in a scene that involved her, which is hard to imagine happening with Katie Holmes' Rachel. The dialogue here is much better than it was on the previous movie, too. There are still some corny moments, especially with Dent, but I feel like every character has better dialogue, one liners, monologues - just better writing overall, especially when it comes to the Joker himself, of course. Way more natural, less filled with self-importance. Same about cinematography - better shots, more memorable compositions. It was Kubrick who said that a movie is just a sequence of pictures, and it really is, you know? And there are indeed a lot of visually memorable moments here, stills that stick out in a good way. Now, a few complaints: Harvey's character, as crucial as it is to the struggle on Gotham's soul, the way Joker puts it, still has a weird character arc. Not getting into spoilers, but the way Harvey changes throughout the movie feels a bit forced - maybe even laughable, just a bit. I just don't see how it works, not to this extreme level at least. Also, Nolan makes sure to do some elaborate stuff that's supposed to make you feel smart, when in reality it's just a mess - the fingerprint moment, the twist that happened after the ""I want you to do it"" moment. He just needs to understand that sometimes less is more, that elaborate twists are sometimes just a burden to a good plot. Still, the worst moments of this film aren't close to be as bad as the worst of its predecessor. The Dark Knight is much better than Batman Begins. It's actually, believe it or not, a pretty good movie, which is a rather rare thing as far as I'm concerned when it comes to Nolan movies. It shows improvement on all fronts - cast, soundtrack, cinematography, and especially with the villain - Joker, who creates a good conflict here, the type that can make even a rather bland main character like Nolan's Batman more interesting. The games the Joker plays, the cruel, memorable schemes. It's much more dark, mature and refined, compared to the first film in this trilogy. Nolan stills does some corny Nolan stuff, but it really is a good movie. Worth watching, even if far from a masterpiece in my opinion. I'm feeling a 7.3/10 on this one.",negative,3,tt0468569

"Yes, Fight Club has an amazing twist in it, and that twist did blow me away. It also starts out strong with Edward Norton, who is one of my favorite actors, in a therapy group meeting some interesting people. However, as the plot kept rolling, it became too over-the-top for its own good.  The movie was supposed to be about finding out who the true you is, but yet all of the ""followers"" had no personality at all.  They were just drones, and I didn't buy into the fact that so many people would be involved in this ""Project Mayhem"", without somebody getting a conscience and blowing the lid off of it.  I call this the ""JFK"" syndrome, where everybody and their dog is involved with the conspiracy.  Completely unrealistic, and movie gets really bogged down with it. The plot twist and the excellent performances by Norton and Pitt were enough for me to recommend you watch this once.  But in my opinion, this movie was not nearly good enough to be rated in the top 250 of all time.  Highly overrated. 6/10",neutral,6,tt0137523
"I'll take movie ripoffs for $400, Alex This movie, released in 2001, blatantly stole the plot of ""Point Break"" starring Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves. What is ""The Fast and the Furious?"" Correct! What more is there to say? The only difference is they substituted outlaw street racers for outlaw surfers. Otherwise the plots are identical. A cop goes undercover to break up a ring of thieves. He falls for the outlaw chick and finds himself admiring the ringleader. The only real difference is ""Point Break"" had a much better ending, unlike the ""let's wrap it all up on a happy note"" of TF&TF. 3/10 and that's for the stunts and cool cars.",negative,3,tt0232500
"As I reminisce about the first time I saw Hans Solo, his daring escapades, has strong flawed character, his sharp wit, he was a space traveling Indiana Jones, telling a fresh story, even now, as I rewatch the old star wars, which is older than me at 41 years old, still has a fresh feel. Solo, which came out today in my neck of the woods, feels like it was made of old bland ideas that have now been shot out into space with added CGI. It is an average film at best, but as a film in the Star Wars brand, it is well below expectation. Three words spring to mind. Could do Better. This film deserves 5/10 but I'm giving it a 1/10 to send a message that the direction the Star Wars Brand is going isn't ""Star Wars"" for me. Solo is an average space drama with and average script, nothing more nothing less",neutral,5,tt3778644

"Original review: Had good and bad, overall pretty good. Some of the stories were scary and well done, others were not. But the ones I didn't like were still interesting and creative. A lot more of the horror was gore in this one. Gore is not scary. I liked the first and last stories the best. Didn't come close to the original. Second viewing: Maybe I wasn't as much of a seasoned horror veteran back in 2013. But this movie is BEASTLY. I think I like it slightly better than the original. The last two segments are my top two amongst the segments from both movies. They go so hard, ramping up to a thousand. Updating rating from 6 to 8 stars.

"Woah!  Wait a sec, what was that?  OK, I don't want to get too excited and overstate anything so let's try again... Fight Club is the Best Movie of All Time. Holy cow, so why? This is a story about an ordinary guy.  You can relate to this guy.  He could be the guy you sit next to on the bus.  He could be the guy you work with.  He could be your closest friend.  He could be you, or me.  An ordinary guy, a guy you know.  A guy you can relate to and feel involved with.  Now what possibly could happen to an ordinary guy that's so interesting that some anonymous person on the Internet says it's the best movie of all time... Well, many things I guess.  There are lots of movies about ordinary guys that have interesting stuff happen to them.  So why is this one so good? It's cool.  Ed Norton is cool.  Brad Pitt is cool.  Helena Bonna Carter is cool.  Hey, I never thought I'd say this but even Meat Loaf is cool.  If they were your friends, you'd be the coolest kid in school.  No question. You feel cool just watching this movie.  The story is a little out there, but hey, that's all part of the fun. The Dust Brothers are the pulse behind the action that sets the momentum for the film.  From the opening credits we are into the action and from there it doesn't stop.  It doesn't slow down; it just takes you on a ride, which if you let it, will take you to a place worth visiting over and over again. Although a great movie, it is not for everyone.  So don't kid yourself. If you don't like violence in movies you won't like this movie.  If you don't like being confronted you won't like this movie. Some seemingly misunderstand the message behind the film, or take it too literally.  If you're not sure, and you're going to view this movie I urge you to keep an open mind. Ed Norton & Brad Pitt both give their best performances to date.  They are cast so well and are believable in their rolls.  But you know the best thing about this movie?  Well, I cannot tell you.  Can I suggest you stop reading the user comments now or some idiot will spoil it for you.  Just see it. Take the ride. 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523
"Seeing this movie for the first time will change the way that you view life. Edward Norton plays such a good role as the narrator while is friend Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) just makes this movie become amazing! David Fincher has made a masterpiece of a movie by Capturing amazing moments through interesting diologue, an amazing soundtrack and sound effects, and mostly through a first person point of view. Fight club while make you happy and just want to watch it again ASAP. People may disagree with this movie being in the top 10 on IMDb but I will always Ageee with it as this movie still ceases to same me today. On my top. 10 list, it rates number 3 under the shawshank redemption and the dark knight, however, I was really close to rating this number 2 but the dark knight just overpasses it. Fincher is an amazing director and I can't wait to see what he's got coming next. I would highly recommend seeing this movie and finally I give it a 10/10 for the amazing storyline, diologue, soundtrack and actors placed into this film.",positive,10,tt0137523
"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now. True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be. The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate. Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it. The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated. In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox",positive,10,tt0068646
"The idea was great, interesting, somewhat weird and stomach-churning. But the movie doesn't live up to it. There are some good things aside from this idea, I liked the stylistic nods to Hitchcock and Kubrick, the camera work and lighting are good and while he occasionally resorts to cartoon villainy Dieter Laser has many moments where he is genuinely chilling. Against all this, the story is very predictable and lacking in suspense. Despite the premise, it is actually fairly light on gore and gruesome scenes and this diminished the suspense levels for me. The direction has a lot of style but not a lot of substance, technically the film is assured but the characters are stock and the remainder of the other acting is uninspired. The Human Centipede is a very poorly written movie in my opinion with dully written and delivered dialogue and big, obvious and unforgivable medical errors. Overall, has a good idea but bad dialogue, a lack of suspense and a dull story stop it from being any more effective. 3/10 Bethany Cox",negative,3,tt1467304
"I saw this movie on midnight of opening night. To prepare myself for this movie I watched Batman Begins at 9:00 PM and then when it was over it was basically time to get to the theater and watch The Dark Knight. As everyone has mentioned, Bale and Ledger's performances are out of this world, and the supporting cast of Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman make this one of the best acted summer blockbusters I've ever seen. The flaws for me came from director's choices that I didn't agree with, and one of those choices was to change the feel of Gotham. Batman Begins had a very specific Gotham which really created a credibility and a home turf for Bale's Batman. There were the eerie side streets, there was the disgusting subway which led to Wayne Tower which was a towering monstrosity in the center of the city. There was the prison island, the smoke effects, and a lot of stylistic choices to keep the viewer somewhere between movie and comic book. Gone is that city, in fact Dark Knight feels like it could have been shot in NYC, Philadelphia, or Chicago, and they didn't try to disguise that they did that. The other major choice that they made that I disagreed with was trying to take Dark Knight and just push the ""dark comic book movie"" genre a little farther. Batman Begins was a dark movie, as was Spiderman 1, 2, and 3, Sin City, and all of those comic book movies. The Dark Knight simply felt to me like they were trying to make this darker, and would find every way they could to do so. As Iron Man proved...sometimes there's nothing wrong with some laughs and lightheartedness at times. I think Batman Begins toed the line really well keeping it funny at enough times that it made the movie not so overwhelming and heavy. This movie did not do the same, and while the laughs definitely came...I can't say that this movie was as good as the last one, or contrary to some of the belief on here, is as good as the hype made it out to be. 6/10 for the fact that it's a great Batman movie, that unfortunately was unable to keep some of the spirit from Batman Begins alive that truly made Batman Begins the beginning of a franchise which had an original feel to it. My suggestions: Bring back the old Gotham...it made the movie feel much better as a whole.",neutral,6,tt0468569

"This is a story of a man with something missing in his life. He doesn't necessarily know what it is, but its missing. And with a chance encounter with another person, his life changes. For the better or for the worse is for the viewer to decide. When I first viewed this film, I was 14 years old and a freshman in high school. I bought it right off the shelf without having previously seen it, because I heard it was good. I watched it the night that I bought it, and was changed somehow. I knew that I liked it, but I wasn't sure why. So I watched it again. And again. And again; 6 times over the following 2 weeks. And when I got familiarized with the philosophy and artistic value, it became even better. The flawless direction, the superb writing, and the perfect casting make this dark comedy one of the best films ever made, and also my favorite movie. Its more than just a movie, its a work of art. Its a great piece of literature converted to the screen. Fight Club can change your life if you give it a chance. It did for me. It gives people a new take on how life can be lived. A new take on what you are as a human being and what you can become. Its an instant classic and a movie should be viewed by everyone who is unsure of themselves. 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523
"Phenomenal I have seen this movie many many times in the past few years but this week was the first time I was able to experience it in the Cinema! As crazy as it sounds, I was even more impressed than normal and the one thing that stood out as a difference is getting to experience the soundtrack in the cinema, oh my god it's perfection. I'm pretty sure a movie 15 years old everyone knows what it's about but I have to say Heath Ledger is rightly known as one of the best villains if not best cinematic performances ever, every single time he was on screen I was immersed, all these years later I still am blower away by him. This movie is truly one of the best out there, lately being compared to The Batman 2022 and they are both so different, you just can't compare as they are both in a calibre of their own ! 9/10.",positive,9,tt0468569
"Amazing. The best superhero movie so far. I loved Batman Begins, but this surpasses it with honors. Heath Ledger is one of the key reasons its so good. His acting as the Joker deserves an Oscar nomination, if not the statue. He makes you laugh and petrifies you at the same time. His mannerisms are incredible and Nolan shows the audience a Joker that is no joke, he is a representation of pure and utter anarchism. Bale is great as Batman, not portraying him as a hero, but as the flawed human Batman represents. Gary Oldman (one of my favorite actors since Leon) portrays perfectly Lt. James Gordon, an idealist lieutenant that believes in the goodness of Gotham city. Batman's ideals, as well as Gordons, become in danger when the Joker appears, causing chaos and desperation in a city that is starting to believe in its heroes. This factor makes the film so incredible. The film becomes about society and the greater good instead of just about Batman. Every character in the film becomes affected by evil to different degrees. No character is left untouched and no one is saved from the joker and his madness. The action is incredible and so are the special effects, and Nolan builds up to the climax with perfection. The tempo is the film is rapid and filled with adrenaline, there is not one moment in the film when action does not fill the screen, something that can ruin several films (Lee's Hulk), but because of stellar direction, makes this one work. The only problem I had with this film is Aaron Eckhart. I liked him, but I did not love him. He portrays a Harvey Dent that everyone in Gotham, loves, yet, I did not. He wasn't as charismatic as in ""Thank you for smoking"" or as sassy in ""No reservations"", he was dark and at times seemed resented and egocentric, even when he was supposed to be the White Knight, the only ""pure and good"" character in the film. The audience does not feel for him like for the other characters, he has a negative quality to his Dent that makes us want to stay away from him. Maybe Ryan Gosling or Hugh Jackman could have done a better job. This is not to say that he did a bad one, the role could have just been re-casted better. Apart from that, the movie is incredible and one of my favorites. It is by far the best superhero movie by date, and as a crime thriller it can be compared to ""The departed"" because of its constant action and suspense. The score, the makeup, the costumes and everything else work to perfection. I had REALLY REALLY high expectations for this film. It excelled them. If you have not seen it, go to the theater right now. This film is going to become a classic. (9/10)",positive,9,tt0468569
"This movie definitely has its moments but overall it is not more than a small charming melodrama which is worth watching but nothing too special. The hyperactive humor of Benigni reminded me of Louis de Funes which I find almost(!) unbearable. The contrast between the horrors of the concentration camp and Guido's effort to pretend it's all a funny game to keep his little son from the truth is quite a bit out of balance. This movie does not do justice to the demise of the prisoners in those camps. I'm sure it was not Benignis intention to show torture, violence and death as Schindler's List but in my opinion this subject does not leave room for extenuation for the sake of a friggin' movie. Overall this film tends to be quite naive (especially at the end)which, again, I think is intentional. Nevertheless, I don't like that at all. With all due respect for Benigni, his craft and talent and his father (who was held captive in Bergen-Belsen) this is playing with fire - in a moral sense. The romantic aspects are very naive too but also quite cute and funny - maybe just because of that naivety. Additionally I'm starting to get uncomfortable with the fact that even modern movies seem to be unable to shake the habit of showing German WW2 soldiers as nothing but fat and/or creepy squallers. But there have been movies far more worse then this one. So it's just a small bellyacher. It's a good movie. Charming and funny but with quite a few weaknesses. It surely would have been better to work on that superficial ""la dolce vita"" atmosphere. The Academy Award is justified but only because of the lack of competition. 6/10",neutral,6,tt0118799

Later on we find out that she had been down that road before and she was trying to better herself.  She was confused and just wanted to be accepted for something else besides her body in a business that thrives on it. Kyle MacLachlan's character accepted her and that's why she was with him, not because she loved him.  I never got the feeling they were in love.  The swimming pool love scene was so over the top it was laughable.  Some the scenes were not realistic because they tried to be serious, but ended up being funny.  The nudity is good in this film.

Even still the twist at the end, did not live up to it's hype and was not as good as movies like ""The Usual Suspects"". I am a fan of Bruce Willis and he has his moments in this one, but I for one cannot stand Haley Joel. I believe his best movie was Forrest Gump and thats because he had few lines and was in 5% of the movie. I am not saying that ""The Sixth Sense"" was a terrible movie, but it does not live up to it's hype and certainly not to the IMDb top 100 rating. It was a very uneventful flick with boring dialogue and a very dry plot. To put it bluntly it bored me to tears. After weeks of hearing praise and worship after the viewing I was severely disappointed. The ending was good, but the rest of the movie was just average. If you want to see a good M. Night movie, watch ""Unbreakable"", I think ""Signs"" was just as overrated. All in all I gave this movie a 6/10 or maybe a B-.

"This movie is around 3 hours long-and it felt like 3 days. And yes it is quite good, but an epic in pretentiousness and political correctness, which assures it of a clutch of awards. The earth is dying, so NASA needs to use a worm hole to find an alternative planet. The hero's are a father and his daughter. In brief the story asks the question will the search for another habitable world be successful or not? The film explores amongst other things that popular sci fi idea of time travel. Unfortunately much of the picture is full of junk science and techno babble. Throw in some strong ideas about ""love"" and family and a famous poem, and that is about it. Good points: special effects, production design, a number of good one liners. Bad points: Far too long, an unnecessary complicated and convoluted story line plus having Michael Caine in the film. He very nearly ruins it as he speaks like a cockney selling fruit in a street market rather than a respected scientist that he is meant to portray. Because of the bad points I need to significantly reduce my vote and hence I give this: 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0816692

"So the latest in what is becoming a long running sci-fi franchise sees Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich) get his prequel movie. Unsurprisingly, such is the ferocious core fan base of the Star Wars series, it has been met with a mixture of outright hatred to pats on the back appreciation. It really is a case here of jumping in to view it on its own terms to at least give it a chance. The truth is, is that if this was a stand alone movie being judged purely as a science fiction action movie, then it would be better appreciated. For this is cracker jack entertainment in that sphere, with superbly constructed worlds inhabited by delirious looking aliens species, feisty droids hold court, and the humans are daring, cheeky and even sexy. It is in short quality and fantastical sci-fi, even if in truth as per the Solo character trajectory it's safe film making. We, as in the royal Star Wars fans we, all have our card carrying belief that our opinion on any Star Wars film is correct, but really the only advice I can honestly give here is that if you haven't seen it yet then at least give it a chance. Those that have seen it have their minds made up either way, so personally I can only say how much fun I had watching it - twice! All the dots are joined towards the Solo character I love so dear, from back when with childhood eyes in the late 70s I was transfixed on that big screen.

"In this review I'm not going to give a plot synopsis of this film because I'm sure everybody else who has commented on it has. However, I will express the positive effect it can have on the viewer if they let it. The acting is uncommonly magnificent. Morgan Freeman delivers the greatest performance of his brilliant career as the seasoned life-serving prisoner Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, Tim Robbins holds his own against Freeman as Andy, the central character, James Whitmore's portrayal of the institutionalized Brooks provides the backbone of the story, Bob Gunton is wonderful as the corrupt Warden Norton, and Clancy Brown's commanding performance as Captain Hadley, the sadistic head prison guard, almost makes him steal the show from Freeman. Frank Darabont's restrained direction of the delicate story is critical for the film to not become sentimental or clichéd, and his beautiful adaptation of the Stephen King story on which the movie is based is a real breath of fresh air. On account of Darabont, the film shows that special effects are not needed to tell a great story in film. As a 17-year-old male, I love special effects movies as much as the next person, but they get boring after a while. Plus many people forget that there was a time in cinema when the blockbuster didn't exist, when they made movies that just told great stories and gave the audience a chance to be uplifted by those stories without the creators having to resort to special effects. I applaud you for having the guts to make a non-commercial film that reminds people of that in this day and age, Mr. Darabont. SPOILER ALERT! As with all truly great films, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is full of scenes that have become entrenched in the public's collective consciousness. There's the scene where Andy plays the opera record over the loudspeaker for all the inmates in the prison, Captain Hadley bashing ""Fat @$$"" to death for crying during his first night in prison (a very powerful scene), Red giving his ""Rehabilitated?"" speech to the board of parole officials, the Warden getting his final judgement, and of course, Andy crawling to freedom through what Red in his narration calls ""500 yards of s**t-smelling foulness I can't even imagine,"", the scene which for me is perhaps the greatest movie scene of the '90s. END OF SPOILERS! I thoroughly recommend this cinematic masterpiece, which has earned its place in my humble top ten films of all time list, to anybody. Whatever gender, age, religion, nationality etc. you are and whatever language you speak, I guarantee it will change your life, or perhaps even save it. Movies like 'The Shawshank Redemption' only come along once every decade, if that. Unforgettable. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0111161

"Based on the novel of Chuck Palahniuk Fight Club is with no doubt a film that sets a huge bar for future films of the kind. Everything in it just looks like poetry in motion. The direction of Mr.Fincher is at is finest (better than in Seven, as if that was possible), to a fantastic photograph, great soundtrack and finally an incredibly well written, honest, rude and brilliant script. The Acting: Edward Norton does basically two roles in one film; starts at a slow pace, he remind me of a lost and broken soul until he let's himself go by the steps of Tyler Durden, without a doubt one of his best work. Helen Boham-Carter always does a good job, very secure with no flaws and very credible. Finally, Mr.Pitt does an outstanding job as Tyler Durden, the bad ass that everyone wants to look a like. Tyler's lines are the best thing in the whole movie and the way that Pitt puts his charm into tell it and the way that he makes us fall in love for Tyler Durden no matter what he says, no matter what he does is unique. Great work! This movie is passionate, wrong, serious but most of all REAL! Hands down the best film of 1999. Fantastic work from everyone that was involved!

"FILM: 8.5/10. Ah, Home Alone, a Christmas classic that needs no introduction. What can one say about it that hasn't been said before? Well, I won't attempt the impossible. In a nutshell, Home Alone seamlessly weaves traditional Christmas themes with uproarious comedy and slapstick. There's an undeniable joy in watching a kid take on grown men in a symphony of hilariously comical beatdowns. It's the kind of cinematic catharsis that never gets old. Sure, the plot's technological irrelevance in today's mobile-dominated world is glaring. A quick call would resolve the entire predicament. Yet, Home Alone's charm transcends its outdated premise, entertaining on a nostalgic level that warms the heart. Macaulay Culkin, in his iconic role, manages not to overstay his welcome-well, mostly. The initial excessiveness mellows, and by the film's end, it delivers a surprisingly solid message, even if the finale leans a tad too saccharine for my taste. Fortunately, it doesn't overshadow the rest. The true magic unfolds when Culkin faces off against Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. The mischief, the traps, the sheer chaos - it's a festive spectacle that captures the spirit of Christmas in an unconventional, albeit hilarious, way. Nothing says 'tis the season like watching these two stumble through a gauntlet of burns, impalements, and face-smashing. Home Alone isn't just a movie; it's a time capsule of holiday joy. Its enduring appeal lies not just in the laughs but in its ability to transport you back to a simpler, more mischievous time. So, when you find yourself in need of a Christmas pick-me-up, just let young Kevin McCallister and his ingenious traps work their holiday magic. FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray VIDEO: 9/10.

"For many years, I have wanted to see this movie. I had heard various opinions praising the performances, the scenery, the soundtrack... However, I never got to see it, until today. And, after seeing it, I can affirm that it is a contender to be one of the best films in history. There is no criticizable point. Heath Ledger's performance is one of the best performances ever given on the big screen, and even the secondary characters shine. The city has a tone of horror, suffering and fear, just as someone would imagine Gotham, and all this thanks to the excellent setting that this feature film presents, both in terms of the scenery and the music, composed by the famous Hans Zimmer. Last but not least is the plot, and I can firmly say that it is one of the best I have ever heard in my life. I still can't assimilate how well the Joker's plans are made, worthy of a crazy but charismatic and cunning villain. In conclusion: 10/10.",positive,10,tt0468569
"I hope this does not infringe copyright but first of all I have to quote this humourous commentary i saw somewhere: ""I thought I had already seen the worst movie of 1999 but after watching ""Fight Club,"" this was wrong as ""Fight Club"" took the honor. There was no point to this film and it was the waste of talent for two otherwise excellent actors. There is not much to say about ""Fight Club"" because there was nothing worthwhile to remember. After the first ten minutes of this film, I realized I was watching a film that is best described by the condition of the house the two lead characters were living in old, delapidated, rundown and an ugly home. Brad Pitt made a wrong career move selecting ""Fight Club"" and Edward Norton just wasn't thinking as he made his decision. With a story that made no sense, action that was non-existent and performances that were poor; ""Fight Club"" was nothing more than a time and space filler for the studios. "" Well that was the most perfect demonstration of how a milestone movie can be spoilt by Spiderman-Independence Day-Titanic fans. No offense to those fans though, but this is a movie that compels you to think, like Matrix, like American Beauty. It's not a popcorn-and-tears movie. I'm sorry. I've read plenty of reviews after I watched it coz I couldn't completely understand it. But the fact is, nobody seems to do either. So there're either too much gimmicks, or too much depth. I hope it's the latter. To me, it is a movie that reflects on the age of modernization and commercialization. We are all slaves of the lives we pursue. To Tyler Durden, only destruction, which leads to nullifying the society established on paychecks and credit cards, can save the human beings out of this vicious cycle. It's a struggle against the loss of sanity or freedom in a capitalistic world. That's why fight club. That's why fighting. So why the hell Jack(if that's his name) made a compromise to Tyler's ambition in the end? Coming back to reality? Tragedy of life? Tyler Durden is so unforgettable. Brad Pitt put in an unparalleled performance. The camerawork is revolutionary, I believe Matrix drew inspiration from it. And the dialogue is brilliant and stunning. In many ways it is comparable to American Beauty(browbeating the boss), which has a tragic ending as well. Both are classic. The only thing I'm confused with is Helena's role. What the hell is she doing here? I hope it's not another Hollywood trick that murdered a masterpiece. 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0137523
"It's no surprise Pixar has another big hit on their hands with Coco, but I'm just happy it's with a subject matter and setting that they have yet to tackle yet. Dozens of films in, and they are beginning to expand their geographical reach with storytelling. That's a long time sure, but it's most certainly better late than never. Luckily, Coco isn't just an exploration into a new territory for Pixar, it's also a brilliantly charming and original film that delves into deep themes without forgetting what makes kids films entertaining and special in their own right. It's not that Pixar or Disney Animation hasn't given us several movies that encourage children to reach for their goals (but to also remember family), but I love the way Coco uses the power of music into those genre clichés. One of my favorite films of all time is Almost Famous, and that's also a film that nails the power of music in an endearing way. Coco does this while also telling a beautiful story of family (a big one that is) in a visually stunning way. Just as Moana, Inside Out, and Finding Dory did for Disney Animation and Pixar in the last few years, Coco once again progresses the world of animation to an entirely new level. There's one particular shot in Coco, as Miguel first enters and gazes upon the world of the dead, that is among the most impresses shots visually that I have seen in quite some time. Of course, Coco isn't just a technical darling, it's also a heartfelt story of a family with tradition, and sometimes there's nothing more likable than that. It isn't easy to truly care about a group of dead family members to the lead character, Miguel, but somehow this film manages to do just that. Probably due to the charisma of young Miguel, the witty dialogue, and poignant direction from Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina. With a few twists and turns, well-developed characters, dazzling visuals, and one epic journey, Coco is yet another solid entry into Disney/Pixar's long list of animated adventures. It was a little long in the tooth (as was the excruciating Olaf ""short"" in front of it) but it didn't take away from the importance and impact that Coco will have an audience's of all shapes and sizes. 8.6/10",neutral,6,tt2380307
"Well, that was definitely one of the most offensive films I've ever watched. Not that I would expect anything less from a Kevin Smith, especially one that is now 13 years old. Perhaps not as much charm or originality as the first film, but Clerks II contains plenty of heart and breathes new air into what at the time became a franchise (aren't we all still waiting for the trilogy capper?). And look, the appeal has never been the acting in Smith's films, but rather the meandering script and the surprising charm that he weaves in throughout. For all the ridiculousness (and seriously it's absurd), the last 10 minutes are something truly special. 8.0/10",negative,0,tt0424345
"Fight Club is a different film. It has the power to change the way you see your past, present and future. This effect usually 'is seen' in a lot of Hollywood movies (judging by the opinion of the average spectator) and they think that the first decent movie they see is the best in the world. No, they are wrong. The movie makes you understand some things about real life. To be fair, I admit that you have to see the movie twice to understand completely the meaning of the film. But it is so powerful... Actually, I've seen a lot of movies. Some better than others, obviously. And although I recognize this isn't (quality terms speaking) the best film in history, it is the one that has shocked me the most. 9/10.",positive,9,tt0137523
"Fight Club is a visceral, provocative, and darkly satirical exploration of masculinity, consumerism, and identity in the late 20th century. Directed with stylish intensity by David Fincher, and anchored by standout performances from Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter, the film remains one of the most talked-about and dissected cult classics in modern cinema. Plot and Themes At its core, Fight Club follows an unnamed narrator (Edward Norton), a white-collar insomniac disillusioned by his mundane life and meaningless corporate job. His encounter with the charismatic soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) leads to the creation of an underground fight club-a raw, primal response to the emasculation and spiritual emptiness of modern life. What starts as an outlet for rage evolves into something far more anarchic and dangerous. Thematically, the film critiques materialism and questions modern definitions of masculinity. It explores the alienation felt by men in a consumer-driven world, the dangers of unchecked ideology, and the psychological costs of repressing emotion and vulnerability. Performances Edward Norton delivers a nuanced and layered performance, effectively capturing his character's mental unraveling. Brad Pitt, meanwhile, is magnetic as Tyler Durden-an embodiment of chaos, charisma, and anti-establishment rebellion. Their dynamic is central to the film's psychological tension. Helena Bonham Carter, as the nihilistic Marla Singer, adds depth and unpredictability, serving as a mirror to the protagonist's fractured psyche. Direction and Style Fincher's direction is bold and unrelenting. His signature moody visuals, kinetic editing, and use of CGI enhance the surreal and paranoid atmosphere. The film's score, by The Dust Brothers, perfectly complements its gritty tone. Controversy and Legacy Upon release, Fight Club was polarizing-praised by some as a brilliant critique of modern society, condemned by others as violent and irresponsible. Over time, it has gained recognition as a film far more thoughtful and self-aware than it first appeared. Still, it's often misunderstood-particularly by those who idolize Tyler Durden without recognizing the satire behind his philosophy. Final Verdict Fight Club is not for everyone. It's violent, provocative, and often uncomfortable. But it's also fiercely original, intellectually engaging, and visually stunning. Whether viewed as a cautionary tale, a critique of toxic masculinity, or a psychological character study, it's a film that demands conversation and introspection. Rating: 9/10.",positive,9,tt0137523
"terrible acting, a pathetic plot, stereotypical characters and a predictable soundtrack filled with moronic rap songs. How anyone can enjoy this film is beyond my belief. I don't care if it does have cool cars. The cars should have nothing to do with how good a movie is. Any idiot can slap together a movie with cool cars in it. Fast and Furious is a prime example. If the move had a better plot, WAY BETTER ACTING (the key downfall to the film), and a different cast then it might have been watchable. MOVIES LIKE THIS SIGNAL THE DEATH OF FILM!!! Don't even rent.

"The plot is very simple. Same as 300 with a load of retards and rubbish jokes. First there was Date and then Epic. Now its Meet The Spartans. Why do they do this? Everyone hated the fist two films. Now they are spoofing 300. Why can't Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer accept the fact their films are bad. They are just wasting their money on these movies. If they keep doing this, then no one will want to see their films. All they do is take one successful film and turn it into something trashy. Their are barely any laughs in this film. Its just actors acting like they need to visit a mental home. I don't know but they are just not funny. They try too hard. I am surprised this hasn't won or been nominated for any razzie awards. They definitely deserve it. Overall this is a terrible film that is not worth any money at all. Watching this film and coming out thinking ""wow!

"I truly wish all those who believe this film is boring and overrated can understand it one day. Everything in The Godfather is executed to the utmost degree. Characters- Each member of the family is very distinct. From the very serious Tom to wacky Clemenza to fiery Sonny to wise and calculated Vito to cold Michael, The Godfather has very colorful characters. Cinematography- Gordon Willis, the main cinematographer of The Godfather does an excellent job portraying a gritty city, riddled with crime. There are beautiful shots of the urban landscape. My favorite in particular is the one with the Statue of Liberty, the black car and the grainy field. Setting- The Godfather taking place over 10 years is perfect. Starting with the end of WW2, with Michael being a veteran and all and ending 10 years later, no longer being loyal to his country but to the family. Writing- There's a reason it's up there with Chinatown and Casablanca as a film among the top three greatest American screenplays. The slow descent of madness is perfectly executed. 10/10.

"I have just returned from one of the most pivotal, exciting, edge-of-my-seat movie-going experiences I have ever had the pleasure and thrill of attending. This film is by a very colossal margin the most impressive achievement in film making i have seen this year. Perhaps taking on the sole role of Summer Blockbuster, THE DARK KNIGHT: in its length of nearly 3 hours, is jam packed with Popcorn perfect action, jaw-dropping special effects, and perhaps the most complex, twisted, and purely sadistic persona ever captured on film. Immediately, and I mean immediately, the film opens with action, comedy and thrill, and for the next 152 minutes, never lets go for a chance to breathe, because quite frankly, there is no room for it in this film that, somehow, builds endlessly like a tightrope and just keeps going, and going, and going until its explosive, emotional climax, and then it keeps going, and going, and going until its unexpected, bittersweet conclusion. Very rich in the special effects department, this film uses many elements that are simply real: props, lighting, pyro, and fake elements, using CGI only when absolutely necessary, and it blends in simply beautifully. Because of the film's scale, which stretches halfway around the world, along with the seemingly larger-than-life occurrences that are pulled off perfectly, this film just looks real. The realism in the personal elements, along with the violence and technology strewn throughout the epic film, adds only more to the film's sense of it happening right there in front of you. The people in this film aren't just pawns anymore, they are entangled into a complex conundrum of the difference between what is right, and what is fair, a concept deliberated between the so-called Light knight: Harvey Dent, and the caped crusader himself throughout the entire film up unto its final, grindingly suspenseful moment. Of course, this personal review would be shamed and incomplete without an analysis on Heath Ledger's jaw dropping, smile-inducing, shock provoking, and mind-bending performance as the twisted, sadistic Joker. From the first moment we set eyes on that wretched, nasty face of his, we are clinched in his grasp until the film's end. We are NEVER sure or aware of when he will show his painted face as the film progresses, and sometimes, or should i say no times, is it met with any warning or preparation. You feel almost unsafe in your own theatre, because you are simply out of control, as the viewer it has become impossible to dictate his actions and watch them with little more than a sense of a spectator or distant observer. No, you are wrenched in and held down to view his role with every twisted development. Also, a special hats off to the film's music department, headed by James Newton Howard. The Joker's theme is so ear-bending and insanity-ridden, but also excruciatingly simple and low-key, that every time you hear it, you are frightened, scared and uncomfortable because it is always accompanying a scene fit for its madness. When you hear it, you will know. Heath Ledger's performance covers a spectrum so complete and complex that you almost are lost within it at times. He, like his name implies, is actually quite rarely joking, comical or cynical in his dealings, even though he commonly refers to it as his game. This film is really the first batman piece to really analyze the irony and metaphorical complexities in his title. That really, he isn't joking, he isn't out for a laugh so much as a sheer, sadistic thrill from seeing chaos ensue around him, and he gets this until he laughs that teeth-grinding laugh that just beckons for more. He is unhesitant, uncaring, and sly to a fine point in his dealings that seem to somehow work their way into the minds of Gotham's police department, and hopefully the batman as well, for as he says, his world has no rules, but Batman has only his one, and the testing of Batman's rule pushes him into the ultimate internal and external battle he can face. And as an audience member, after it is all said and done, ask yourself if you would have used the same methods against the joker's heartless workings into your soul. The premise that film takes on really does grab you by the throat and force you to think, either then or later. Which is perhaps the main reason i loved this film. THE DARK KNIGHT is a spectacle, it is a summer thriller, it is a romantic struggle, and a pure psychological playground. Go prepared. 11/10",positive,11,tt0468569
"The first time I've seen it, Schindler's list didn't give me much of an impression. It was horrific, black and white, and I was 15. Now, after I got myself quite a cinematographic culture, feeling the urge to identify Spieblerg's masterpiece, I came back to this movie. I knew it was rated as one of the best films generally, ever, but when I took a look at the reviews, I became really worried. Most of the 1/10 ratings bring reasonless motivations for this film's criticism. The main points of criticism that I saw are the following: 1) it manipulates facts; 2) presents a too distinct line between good jews and evil Nazis; 3) too emotional; 4) money grab; 5) ""Holocaust is bad, we already knew it"" (and this is an almost exact quote); 1) the claims for this point of criticism are that it portrays a positive figure of Oskar Schindler, exaggerates several aspects of the holocaust, and portrays essentially bad Nazis (we to this latter point in 2)); Let's get this straight: unlike some reviewers claim, Oskar Schindler didn't end up as an enriched Industrialist, as some reviewers wrongly claim. In other words, he didn't earn off the holocaust anything. On the contrary, he spent his entire fortune on bribes and corruption acts in order to aid his Jewish workers. He even had to escape to Argentina, as many Nazi officers did after WWII. As for the claims of overly dramatisation, that is certainly an aspect of the film. There are a few scenes which are not accurate (e.g. the shower scene - in real life, jews didn't fear the gas chamber as they where purposely misinformed). Generally, though, I didn't see that much of an overly dramatization. Most of the times, the film presented simply factual events. Jews were in fact killed and persecuted, there's nothing overly dramatized. Concentration camps where truly such bloody places as seen in the film. Instead, maybe it even downgraded violence quite a lot., still being incredibly bloody as a film. 2) Good jews vs. bad Nazis; I remember Hans Landa's monologue from the beginning of Inglorious Basterds, which centered on jews being rats in the sense that they're generally a population that could figure out a solution easily. Do not get me wrong here (obviously Landa stereotypes this immensely), but this is portrayed often, mainly in the first portion of the film. Jews going to the Synagogue to buy and sell instead of praying, some jews that join the police force and essentially collaborate with the Nazis, and some jews fight each other when hiding away during the ghetto persecution scene. I clearly would not say that all jews are good nor that all German soldiers are bad, but that shouldn't be a matter to be portrayed in a holocaust film. To see an avid jew, go watch ""A Christmas Carol"". As for ""bad Nazis"", I'd like to clear out again what is Nazional-Socialism. It was an extremist, right-wing movement that enhanced, in this case, Germany's national identity and superiority on the base of racial distinction, and urged violence on anyone that would not be member of the ""superior"" race. This movement, along with fascism, attracted a great deal of fanatics. I'd like to suggest the view of ""Novecento"", which similarly depicts the rise of fascism in Italy and its ruthless cruelty, carried on by it he insane and violent individuals which joined the party in the early twenties. I know that one movie depicted a Nazi soldier's moral division during WWII, called ""Onore e Lealtà"", which has low reviews for the same reason that prevents this film from portraying ""good"" Nazis: it is kind of dangerous, and can easily turn in a glorification of Nazis. Nonetheless, most of the cruelty is carried through a notorious war criminal, Amon Goeth. 3) Spielberg is of Jewish origins. As a filmmaker, he's considered this story very personal. Moreover, he is notorious for being emotional in his serious films. 4) It is well known that Spielberg chose to renounce for his fee as he considered it ""blood money"". Of course studios have to do a profit of their movies, but film is still a form of art. Movie makers of Spielberg's caliber do films without a simple capitalistic view of making money, but with the purpose of making an art work. Schindler's list is not a fancy action blockbuster, if nothing else, its black and white colouring identifies it as an art film. Add the fact the Spielberg felt personal about this story, and you'll realise how empty this claim is. 5) This film was released in 1993; I personally don't know many outstanding holocaust films from before 1993 (certainly a lot from after 1993), or if there were, they certainly weren't as bold as this one. A black and white film about a crude subject that keeps the viewer's attention for 3 hours and 15 minutes. Think about it. I personally believe that, unlike other films (this includes my favourite holocaust film, Son of Saul), gives a such wide view on the holocaust. This film shows most of the aspects of the holocaust, some overrdramatised, but nonetheless represented. It is really stupid to see this movie as unnecessary. Conclusively, I'd like to point out that 6 million jews died due to the Holocaust. The only bigger genocide I know of is that of the native Americans, 18 million only in northen America. Seeing so many 1/10 reviews that base their claims on this being basically Jewish propaganda is worrying, especially considering the rise of right-wing ideologies that happened in the latter years. Are we forgetting history? I hope not. And, in case that's the truth, it's films like Schindler's list that remind us of that.",negative,1,tt0108052
"I've been a big fan of Star Wars since childhood. Not a die-hard or a hardcore convention goer, but I appreciate the franchise a lot. The film Solo, didn't get the reception it wanted and managed to be the first film in the franchise to lose money. However, I wouldn't say that's due to the film by any stretch (I'm not saying its a masterpiece, I'm just saying it's a decent watch). I think the main reason for this films box office demise, was due to Disney and how they market films... by over saturating their newly bought franchises, until it becomes a thoughtless and heartless. I gave this film a go, knowing the bad reviews it had received from the petition fanatics etc. I have to say, the film is pretty entertaining and I was overall, happy with the back story they had came up with for Han Solo. Given, he's a beloved character of Star Wars. So I think, no matter what was produced, someone wouldn't be satisfied. Which is why you should just leave these things untouched. Just think on progressing forwards with films and leave the lore to the fans and books (which I've never read, so...). But anyway, in a nutshell. The film is pretty good, the story is safe and maintains interest throughout, the casting is great and really helped me enjoy it more. Of course, everyone is entitled to an opinion. But to give this film a 1/10 and call it garbage or whatever is a little over the top. It's just an easy to watch film. A 6/7 out of 10 is a fair score.",negative,1,tt3778644
"Perhaps a little too long, but Fight Club is just a very well-made, brilliantly written and superlatively performed film. Essentially a satirical fable, it tells of an insomniac loser teaming up with a seditious soap salesman to form a no-holds-barred-fight club as an outlet for their direction-less aggression. This concept is an intriguing and original one, and works really well. Then there is the script, it is absolutely superb, with dialogue that will make you both laugh and think. Fight Club is very well made, with elaborate production design, great editing and startling images. David Fincher's direction is brilliantly handled and the performances of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are superb.

"The first 3 times I saw this movie, I saw them in large theaters just as it should be.

Despite those minor quirks, I loved the movie in all it´s splendor. Now that I managed to get a great TTT DVD from the oscarsjury, I could watch and scrutinize every little scene and make my new judgment. Well, the movie, on the whole, faired well during the transition between the silver screen and home entertainment. Fact is, several scenes became more clearer on a smaller screen. I feel that I don´t have to recapitalize the story anymore that what has already been done here. The movie is one of the best of 2002, no argue about that.

The delivery of the movie was better than a marvel fan expections. You just can't put your eyes from the movie for 2:30 hours.
Infinity war is not only a complete package of actions, but also a mixture of fun, joy, emotions and heart breaking incidents.
Whoever didn't watch the movie I will suggest them to watch it but only after watching the previous movies otherwise he/she will not get the same taste.",negative,1,tt4154756
"Fight Club is the type of move that jumps up and screams ""I'm a good movie."" It offers so many good ideas and so many cinematic elements that it creates one heck of a wild ride.  It is a film that reveals the plot pieces so delicately that you have to care about what's happening. Fight Club is a thoughtful movie that thinks it could work best as a thriller disguised as an intellectual movie.  The ideas are used to distract the viewer from trying to understand the underlying plot details.  The ending is a bit of a stretch...to say the least.  The somewhat bizarre chemistry between the two leads ends up slapping the viewer in the face. This is a good thing, however, but it is very difficult in determining if this has anything to do with the ideas.  Perhaps there are some underlying thoughts to this deception, but I thought it was a bit of a distraction from determining why the movie was made. There are certain thoughts I thought were very valuable in determining the purpose of the movie.  When Tyler gives the Fight Club members an assignment to get in a fight with an ordinary person and lose, the Norton character says, ""This is not as easy as you think, because most ordinary, normal people would do anything possible to avoid being in a fight.""  There is a breath of relief in this statement, and it says that most people are not the people in Fight Club.  However, the knowledge that there are enough people that could cause a terrible revolution is terribly frightening.  The best part of this idea is the culminating scene between Norton and his boss that turns out to be the most humorous and just downright worthwhile scenes of the past year. Many people have said that Fight Club is corrupting our youth, and, yes, there has been a new upheaval of violent fight clubs spawning throughout the country since the movie's release.  Whether it has something to do with the movie, I have no idea.  I think we've been building up to it, through the violence our children see through movies, news, and on shows that present violent and aggressive characters as role models, like WWF and WCW wrestling.  Perhaps Fight Club is more of a warning than an attempt to cause trouble.  The authors have a somewhat resentment to the societal factors that deprive humans of obeying their nature.  It is a call out to say that perhaps our image of the ""perfect society"" is not attainable.  Deprive people of what comes natural, and there will be a nasty, unhealthy revolution.  This can be used as a metaphor to the movie industry itself. After a prohibition by a board of ethics in the late '30s decided what would be appropriate to show in the movies, movie makers were angered for not being able to show their entire artistic vision.  As time went by, filmmakers became so fed up with these restrictions that they started breaking and bending the rules wherever they could, without realizing the ethical consequences.  The moviegoers went to see these movies because they had never been able to see them.  No one really cared about what the negative repercussions would be from showing these movies, or whether these movies would make the world more perverted or violent.  So now, we have Fight Club, a movie that is about the negative backlashes drawn from a deprivation of human nature, presented in a form that tries to break from the restrictions of film.  The movie is overly violent, but I think that is part of the point.  I don't think it criticizes the violence it portrays because it allows us to understand the thinking behind the violence. Instead, it exists on screen to wake the viewer up, and say ""This is what society is becoming.  Is this what we want?  Are our solutions ever likely of determining the goals?""  Fight club is definitely against restrictions, and that is apparent both in the plot of the movie and the actual existence of the movie itself. The main criticisms I have against this movie deal with the fact that the blend of cinema and ideas don't seem to quite come together in any cohesive fashion.  The cinema distracts from the ideas while the ideas are used as a distraction for the cinema.  These are minor complaints, though, as there are so many valuable gifts from examining both of the film's elements.  My rating: 9/10",positive,9,tt0137523

"This Joker will put a smile on your face! Batman History: Gone are the days when Adam West's campy Batman T.V series used to be the only source of ""Bat Entertainment"" for the audience. The Batman movies of the 90s did not do justice to the great comic book icon. They all made the caped crusader appear as a happy-go-lucky masked vigilante who saved the day at the end with his ""Bat Gadgets"". Where was the character development? A real plot? (Oh please, not the penguin-stole-candy-from-a-baby plot). The superficial storyline and lack of commitment catalysed the fiasco of the Batman franchise. All in all, much to the dismay of fans, a costly costume party was all that we ever saw! A Knight was born: 'Batman Begins"" at last delved into the dark and troubled past of Bruce Wayne. A man trying to find his identity, conquer his worst fears and overcome the grief of the unjust murder of his parents. A man who becomes invincible as a symbol. The magic of this movie lies in the fact that although it is not real, it makes you want to believe that it is! The Dark Knight: The success of Batman Begins opened the flood gates of great expectations and surreal anticipation for perhaps one of the most awaited movie sequels, let alone a Batman sequel. With expectations and speculations running wild, the overzealous promotion and media hype knew no bounds. The Dark Knight was put under microscope long before its scheduled release. The tragic loss of Heath Hedger, especially after whispers of his alleged over-the-top performance, added fuel to the fire. With fans and critics eagerly waiting to sing praise or eviscerate the movie alike, Dark Knight made a smashing entry! The question is, did this movie deliver? Did it live up to the unrealistic expectations of the fans? No. It surpassed it! This movie is not just for fans of Batman, but for all those who love to see a masterpiece. It certainly stretched the limitations of a typical comic book movie. The Joker is not just the avergae psychotic villain who blows things up and deliver jabs and witty retorts. No no no no no! He is more than that. A lot more than that. His every word has a deep psychological connotation to it. He poses moral dilemmas that play with the boundaries of normal ethical conduct and human psyche. Simply put, he puts people under the microscope and test their reaction under extreme situations. And he does it with flair! That's the beauty of it. He creates ingenious situations and traps that tricks everybody into believing something, while something else is happening. Bruce Wayne is pushed to such extremes that he thinks that his days as the caped crusader are coming to an end... As Rachel puts it, ""Bruce don't make me your only hope for a normal life"". We also find that The Joker and Batman have a lot in common. Joker pretty much sums up the entire comic book history between him and Batman as ""You and I are destined to do this forever""... Although they are portrayed as freaks with troubed childhood, it all comes down to the choices that people make at testing times. Harvey and Bruce are both influenced by The Joker's brilliant yet fiendish schemes and the outcome is colossal... You've gotta see it for yourself! This so much more than an action movie. A psychological thriller? Perhaps. The way Joker manipulates human nature is simply ""mind blowing"". Believe me, he is more than what you expect him to be in every single moment of the movie. His influence on Harvey Dent is even more intriguing than it is on the rest. And the fact that special effects are less prominent compared to character development and storyline goes to show that drama and theatrics impacts people on a personal level that all the CGI in the world cannot conjure up. It simply makes you care for the character rather than being a mute spectator of a violent showdown. This movie revolves around deep forgotten fears, traumas, hope, faith and courage. This is poetry in movie making! Rating: 10/10 No questions asked!",positive,10,tt0468569

"I'm afraid I have only to reiterate what others have already said on here - 'The Matrix' is hugely overrated. I, like others, did enjoy it for its sheer escapism, sense of adventure and regular conventions of good vs. evil. There is a great deal to admire in it - the stylistic qualities, good soundtrack, and of course special effects. The fight scenes - to begin with - are fairly mind-blowing, but throughout the 3 films as a whole there are far too many of an almost identical nature. It seems the choreographers ran out of different moves & poses. Onto the less good - as I agree with others, the utterly pretentious and convoluted 'morals' or 'underlying themes' of the film. It seems like just another of a particular ilk, that seeks to confuse the viewer as much as possible, to hide the fact that there is very little intelligent substance in there. As others have noticed, the basic philosophy running through the 3 films has been expressed many times before, only without the needless drivel that is heard in 'The Matrix'. This becomes more apparent in the second film, I must admit, but what IS there from the very beginning, and what annoys me most, is the OVER-CONSCIOUS nature of the film as a whole. It appears set up, from the first, that 'this is going to be a landmark film' - there is a sense of over-importance and worthiness which is, frankly, unconvincing. Not only this, but the dialogue is cliché-ridden, some of it reminding me distinctly of old Bond villain lines, recycled and delivered as if Shakespearian quotes; ""I will enjoy watching you die"" etc. Unlike others, I found Hugo Weaving's performance one of the weakest. The best way to describe it, in a word, is over-acting, and possible one of the worst accents in movie history. I will give credit to Joe Pantoliano, and most of the cast are reasonably likable, but the characters themselves are weak to say the least, and as others have commented the love story is both shallow and superfluous to the plot. In short, I was disappointed with this film as I went into it with an open mind and was ready to enjoy it, from what I had heard from others. However, it fails to deliver on many levels and the over-complicity of the 'philosophy' ruins what enjoyment could have been had from a pretty good and interesting premise. On a final note, I would have to say that the dark glasses - not given a purpose in the film, as far as I can tell - are the ultimate example of what this film really succeeds in: IMAGE. Apart from that, it all seemed rather wasted. I'll give the first instalment of the trilogy 6/10, for pure entertainment value!",neutral,6,tt0133093
"Many hold this in regard as the best superhero-movie of all time, and has given other movies in this genre the biggest shoes ever to fill. I myself believe that to be kind of unfair, since this is not what I would immediately classify as a superhero-movie, simply because it has Batman in it. Because Nolan is such a master at mixing intelligent themes and high-quality entertainment together, he took one of the most iconic superheroes in history and made him a human being in a realistic world, where nothing really is to over the top: no doomsday-devices or superpowers, just a masked vigilante who needs to combat organized crime and the anarchy within the very people he fights for to protect them. He and David S Goyer wrote a complex and layered script with deep characters, and made one of the darkest and well-made crime-noir movies I have ever seen(and I don't even like that genre) Acting: Christian Bale continues to prove that he is a fantastic actor, with a subtle and laid-back performance as Bruce Wayne and a harsh and brutal portrayal of a struggling Caped Crusader. This is not his best role, not by a long shot, but I can imagine that Ben Affleck was pretty nervous to replace this man. Heath Ledger, what more can we say about his real that hasn't already been said? In his final role, he delivered one of the most impressive method-acting roles you will ever encounter, with all odd mannerisms, a creepy voice and laugh, and an enigmatic character that steals every scene. Oscar was well deserved. Aaron Eckhart was the absolute surprise of this movie. Given how few good movies the guy has actually been in, it is a relief and a shame at the same time that he will only be remembered for this role. He gives a down-to-earth, sassy and yet intense performance as a white knight who falls into the abyss of insanity. I believed Bruce Wayne when he said that with a man like Aaron's character, his Batman would no longer be needed. Gary Oldman's role as Jim Gordon gets expanded in this sequel, showing a grim and hard-working commissioner who suffers just as much from the consequenses of underestimating the Joker as the other protagonists. The man gives a great performance. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel is a slight improvement over Katie Holmes, who wasn't very interesting in Batman Begins, but still her character feels like little more than the damsel in distress, and the few words of wisdom and advice that she gives are not nearly enough to compensate for her lack of likability. Veteran Actors like Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine play their part, and they do it well. I can't help but miss the emotional core that was much more present in Batman Begins with these two characters. The sound of their soothing deep voices is enough though to appreciate every scene that they are in. Direction:
Christopher Nolan always has a very clear vision and approach to his movies, and this firm grip is visible throughout the entire movie. The tension and weight is felt in every scene, and even the more lighthearted moments are handled very well. Cinematography:
Wally Pfister, who has worked with Nolan on multiple occasions, has switched drastically in style when compared to Batman Begins. The muddy, brown aesthetic of Gotham in that movie has been replaced with a moody grey, while still maintaining the dark shadowy feel that is associated with Batman. The dialogue scenes in particular are shot very well on steady-cam, and draw your attention immediately. Overall, this is great work. Music:
Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard collaborate for a second time for a Batman Movie, and Hans brought a harsher and more electronical element into the score. The old themes from Batman Begins are still there, but more expanded, and with a harrowing theme for the Joker that sets you on edge the more you hear it pop up. As a score to listen to without the movie, it isn't that solid, but it is essential to the atmosphere of this picture and Zimmer and Howard should receive high praise for this. Plot:
David S Goyer and Nolan wrote a complex and dark movie that can become confusing if not careful. That being said, the execution is brilliantly done, with many twists and turns, and surprisingly relevant questions are brought to
light. Editing:
This ties directly into the plot, and is the main reason why this movie succeeds so well in its execution: because of the complex structure, good editing is necessary, and Lee Smith absolutely delivered in that department. Particulary the scene transitions after powerful emotional moments are exceptionally well done. Sound:
The old sounds from Batman Begins are back, including Batmobile and gadgets, and now also including the high-speed humm of the Batpod and the unique-sounding explosions that you don't really come across in other movies. It is not outstanding, but very pleasant for your ears. Production Design:
Even though the setting of this movie appears quite normal, Nathan Crowley spend an extraordinary amount of detail on the sets and props, making them all feel realistic and Gotham like a real city. Costumes&Make-up:
Batman's dark suit is the best version yet, picturing Batman as a frightening and looming presence without the need to move a muscle. The Joker is exactly what you'd imagine he would look like. So, perfect. VFX:
Nolan uses cgi as little as possible, which is a rarity nowadays, and the major exception is Two-Face. Like Inception, Nolan aims for the perfect blend of digital and the real thing, and when you look at the horrifying imagery, it is really hard to believe that it is not real. Chapeau! Tone:
The darkest Batman movie thus far, largely in thanks to the Joker and his schemes, which have such gruesome consequences that the desperation and fear easily carries over from the screen to the audience. The tension is masterfully handled throughout scenes, and a scene in an interrogation room particulary transcends it to a whole new level. Overall Concensus: While not all characters and actors are as charismatic as they should be, Heath Ledger and the complex script, together with masterful editing and direction, elevate Nolan as one of the best filmmakers working today. 8.6/10",neutral,6,tt0468569
"I've never been a fan of movies based on comic books and I'm pretty sure that I never will be. We are flooded by movies like X-men, Spider-man, Hellboy, Daredevil, Batman,... because the makers of this kind of movies know that the majority of the (teenage American) audience loves movies about the eternal battle between good and evil and seem to have an enormous need for new heroes. That most of those movies don't have a decent story or some good acting to offer, doesn't seem to bother them at all. As long as everything looks as spectacular and flashy as possible, they are happy with it. But I'm not that kind of person. I prefer movies with a believable, touching story and interesting characters over all that computer animated eye candy. So why did I give this movie a try than? The reason is quite simple, I read a lot of good reviews about it and because it still had a rating of 8.3/10 after 45,831, I was very curious about it. The title ""Batman Begins"" already says enough about where you should place this movie in the line of other Batman movies. It's a prequel and starts telling the story where Bruce Wayne is still a child. He witnesses the murder of his parents and is convinced that it was his fault. He seeks revenge, but when the murderer is shot in front of his eyes, he flees to Asia where he seeks counsel from Ra's al Ghul, a dangerous ninja cult leader. Here he learns all the things a perfect fighter should know off, but it doesn't take long before he realizes that Ra's al Ghul's way of live isn't the correct one either. He decides to go back to Gotham City, which has become overrun with crime and corruption. He also finds out that the company which he inherited is slowly being taken over from him. That's when he decides that he will be the new crime-fighter in town who will strike fear into the hearts of the criminals. He becomes Batman and, with the help of some other people, he starts saving the city from the apocalypse... What surprised me the most about this movie was that it took its time to develop the story and the character behind Batman. We get to know him from his childhood on and gradually see him evolve from Bruce Wayne into Batman. But not only Batman feels more realistic as usual, so do the bad guys. OK, it's still a comic book movie, but for once you don't get bad guys who believe they are penguins or something like that. The fact that all the characters in the movie looked more realistic was new to me and I admit that I liked that new approach. What I also liked was the way the city was created. The computer animators have done a very fine job creating Gotham city and the many action scenes looked even more spectacular thanks to their work. I liked the acting and the computer graphics, the story was OK and this is by far the best Batman movie that I've ever seen. Does this also mean that this is one of the best movies in general that I've seen this year, like so many people claim? No, not really, but I admit that it is a lot better than all those other comic book movies. This one definitely stands above all those other movies, almost making them feel like some cheap rip-offs. Still, it's not exactly my kind of movie and that's why I believe that the 8.3/10 is overrated. I know that not many people will share my opinion on this, but I believe that a rating of 7/10 for this movie is a lot more realistic.",negative,3,tt0372784
"This movie was just crude humor all the way, the only part I thought was funny was Hugh Jackmans segment and that was barely that good, it is also the only reason why I gave it a 2.

I would rather chop the tips of my finger off and dip the wound in salt than watch this movie again. Since I saw it I regretted, I found the trailers for other movies much funnier than this. I would not recommend this move to anyone, not even the people I hate the most, I give it a 2/10 and that is being too nice.",negative,2,tt1333125

Also, who the hell hijacks a truck by jumping on it while moving at 65mph? What ever happened to blocking the road and pointing guns at it?  This is a teenagers movie.

"I sat down to watch The Departed with high expectations, only to find myself wondering if I'd accidentally stumbled into a straight-to-DVD sequel of The Boondock Saints. This movie, supposedly heralded as a masterpiece, is nothing more than a hollow, overwrought exercise in testosterone-fueled melodrama. First, let's talk about Jack Nicholson. Here's an actor with decades of iconic performances under his belt, and this is what we get? His portrayal of Frank Costello is so ""subtle"" that it feels like he's auditioning for a cartoon supervillain role. Every smirk, every line delivery screams, ""Look at me! I'm Jack Nicholson playing Jack Nicholson!"" It's almost like he wandered onto the set and decided to wing it while everyone else had to keep a straight face. And speaking of faces, can someone explain to me how Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon were cast as the leads? Leo's constant brooding is less ""tormented soul"" and more ""I forgot my lines, so I'll just squint a lot."" As for Matt Damon, his performance as a rat infiltrating the police force could've been compelling if he didn't spend the entire movie looking like he's just discovered what acting is. It's like watching a man try to assemble IKEA furniture in real-time-confused, panicked, and occasionally angry. Oh, the script! Everyone praises it as being ""tight"" and ""electrifying,"" but to me, it's a tangled mess of clichés masquerading as sharp dialogue. How many more times do I have to hear tough guys drop F-bombs like punctuation? It's as if the writers were paid per swear word and ran out of actual ideas halfway through. Martin Scorsese's direction? Let's just say it's no Shark Tale. Sure, there's a lot of swooping cameras and dramatic tension, but it feels like a film student trying desperately to impress their professor. Scorsese throws so much grit and ""realism"" at the screen that it collapses under its own weight. The editing, which some call ""genius,"" is about as coherent as a YouTube clip montage. And don't even get me started on that elevator scene. Shocking? No. Predictable and overwrought? Absolutely. The entire movie feels like a tired exercise in ticking off ""gritty crime drama"" tropes from a checklist. Lastly, the soundtrack. The Rolling Stones? Again? If I hear ""Gimme Shelter"" one more time, I might lose my mind. We get it, Marty-you like rock music. But there's a fine line between iconic and lazy, and this movie pole-vaults over it. Overall, The Departed is nothing more than a mediocre soap opera wearing a slick Hollywood suit. If this is cinema's crown jewel, I'm switching to knitting tutorials on YouTube. 1/10 stars. Would not recommend unless you're in the mood for a laughably bad attempt at a crime thriller. .",negative,1,tt0407887
"'Shutter Island' is a tough and gritty movie with thrills, tense, suspenseful and a lot of twists and turns. 1954. Bailiffs Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffallo) are sent to a remote island in Boston Harbor to investigate the disappearance of an unsettling murderer (Emily Mortimer) held at the Ashecliffe Psychiatric Hospital, a penitentiary facility specializing in dangerously insane people and disturbed criminals run by the sinister doctor John Cawley (Ben Kingsley) . Teddy has lost his family in an apartment fire years before. There are frequent flashbacks to Teddy's time in WWII as a soldier, and Teddy has internal talks where his dead wife, Dolores (Michelle Williams), gives him advice. McPherson (Ted Levine) is the deputy warden. Males & females are in different buildings with the most dangerous patients in building C and the marshals are told not to go without McPherson & Dr. Cawley accompanying them. They will soon discover that the penitentiary center keeps many secrets and that the island hides something more dangerous than the patients. Someone is missing !. Some places never let you go !. This exciting film with interesting screenplay contains psychological characterization, intrigue, grisly triller, tense situations and is pretty entertaining, though overlong . It's brilliant , atmospheric and slickly developed , almost a masterpiece . Major asset are the continuous suspense and marvelous acting though at the ending becomes into an predictable thriller film. Casting is frankly awesome with exceptional interpretations along with a glamorous cinematography by Robert Richardson. Martin Scorsese directs this complex and somber psychological thriller with a twisted script by Laeta Kalogridis, based on the novel of the same title by Dennis Lehane, author of ""Mystic River"" and ""Gone baby Gone"" both of them brought to the screen by Clint Eastwood and Ben Affleck respectively. Shutter Island (2010) includes tension, emotion, violence, guilt, and the ghosts of the past as a backdrop, this story of madness and paranopia features excellent performances by a cast of the best Hollywood actors led by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is followed by Marc Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer, and others more secondary as Patricia Clarkson, Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levine, John Carroll Lynch, Robin Bartlett, Christopher Denham, Elias Koteas, among others. This gripping motion picture filmed in budget enough was professionally directed by Martin Scorsese, displaying some of his trademarks and characteristics .This prestigious filmmaker has made a lot of notorious and successful movies with the greatest actors delivering terrific acting, such as : ¨Boxcar Bertha¨, ¨Alicia Doesn't Live Here¨ , ¨Color of money¨, ¨Last Waltz¨ , ¨King of Comedy¨, ¨After Hours¨ , ¨Taxi Driver¨ , ¨New York New York¨ , ¨Gangs of New York¨ , ¨Raging Bull¨ , ¨Shutther Island¨ and many others . Scorsese has directed five films that have been selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically or aesthetically"" significant: Mean Streets (1973), Taxi Driver (1976), Last waltz (1978), Raging Bull (1980) and Goodfellas (1990). With Raging Bull and Goodfellas, he is the only director to have two films that were selected for the registry in their first year of eligibility. Rating Shutter Island(2010) 7.5/10, a notable and decent film. The flick will appeal to Martin Scorsese's most ardent fans, who some of them have hailed as a masterpiece.",neutral,5,tt1130884

I was thinking how an all-star cast could be clowning around the screen looking like 1st year drama school kids (Damon and DiCaprio especially). Without a doubt, it's always the directors fault to ruin such a great cast (Star Wars 1->3 all over). When I saw it was Scorsese, I was shocked. This sent me into a stupefied state of melancholy. Scorsese is God but, by his standard, this is rubbish. Re-edit the second half by half and that could certainly salvage it.

"I'm glad to see that a few users did find this movie completely overrated... 'The Sixth Sense' was uninteresting, and though with reasonable character development, there were some basic flaws that I could not shake while watching this movie (and some later flaws that were pointed out to me that made me realize that this film was the most overrated film of 1999)... Firstly - about a year had past since the time Willis was killed, and yet, had he never attempted to talk to his wife? What logic was being used when the audience is led to believe that Willis lived with his wife for a year without talking to her? Not only this, but the fact that most likely the first night that Willis, after being killed and him returning to his house, would have realized something was wrong...this fact ruined the movie... On top of that, other major flaws were made apparent to me (by others) after watching the film - firstly that the dead people were only seen in the areas in which they were killed, raising the question of 'How did Willis manage to walk around town?'... The second major flaw is that surrounding the fact that the church was a safe-haven for Osment's character - i.e., dead people couldn't enter the church; yet Willis does it on more than one occasion... I respect Bruce Willis as an actor, but I feel obliged (as I sometimes do) to point out certain aspects of films when they receives unduly recognition - in this case, the film was cast as truly thought-provoking and intelligent... The ending was indeed different - but that in itself, in my mind at least, was not nearly enough to compensate for the stagnation that was the rest of the film (which was neither thought-provoking as a whole, intelligent, or entertaining)... I would have given this film [2/10], but since Bruce Willis was in it and did the best he could, I honor his talent... [3/10]",negative,2,tt0167404
"The first rule of Fight Club is to not talk about Fight Club...but it's hard to follow when the movie is this good. Some movies follow the basic psychological structure of every day people, however, Fight Club takes you to corners of your imagination that you were too afraid to even get close to. The plot? Very simple yet complicated. A man meets the man of his dreams and together they put together a way for men to relieve stress, its called Fight Club and the name of it says it all, they just fight. However that is only the crust of this very thick plot. I would dive more into it but you'll have to watch to find out. The acting was first class. Edward Norton was flawless as The Narrator, the man who goes through his unsatisfying life wishing he could do something exceptional. Brad Pitt was perfect as Tyler Durden, the man of the Narrator's dreams who helps the Narrator pull himself and his ideas/dreams together. Helena Bonham Carter was exceptional as Marla Singer, the crazy/gritty/disgusting woman who seems to be a burden on The Narrator. Meat Loaf delivered an otherwise award-winning performance as Bob, the physically and mentally deformed man who is so disgusting yet lovable. The plot had more twists and knots than an old rope. However, they all worked in the end, giving us one of the best films in recent cinematic history. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0137523
"Directed by the academy award nominee Christopher Nolan (Memento), 'The Dark Knight' tells the story of Batman's (Christian Bale - Batman Begins), latest challenge: this time he will have to deal with the gruesome and deadly psycho maniac, named The Joker (Heath Ledger - Brokeback Mountain), in a battle that will lead Gotham City to chaos. Christopher Nolan's latest piece of work, handles us a spectacular show of action with a much darker and serious Batman, performed by an excellent Christian Bale, that again, fits on well as the dark knight from Gotham City. Keeping some details previous seen in 'Batman Begins, such as the use of a dark photography to straight up the movie's style, 'Memento's academy award nominee director works some of his magic and delivers a perfect and con masterpiece, much more dramatic than the first, and the proof that he is one of the best directors these days. Helped by his brother, Jonathan (also academy award nominee), the two of them build up a solid script, where they add some excellent details about the characters and a plot where everything is amazingly connected. Every single piece fits in, and in the end you don't even have questions, because the screenplay is perfectly written, and during the movie it all makes sense. I rally liked what they did to some things: like creating the illusion that Batman is not an hero, but an anti-hero, and that Gotham's real hero is Harvey Dent. Plus the creation of a more terrifying maniac Joker, is a deluxe point in the movie, much due to Heat Ledger's outstanding performance, where the late Australian actor leads up, one of the greatest performances I have ever seen. Not kidding. I really hope he wins the Oscar and it would be an outrage if he wasn't even nominated. Finally, three yeas after the release of a revolution in the Batman series, 'The Dark Knight' is pushed to another kind of level, where the word 'masterpiece' applies very well to describe it. I clear up, that when I say that this is one of the best movies ever made, I'm not lying. at all. For those who don't believe me, just watch it and then we'll see what you have to say about 'The Dark Knight'. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0468569
After the many positive or too overrated reviews I thought Shutter Island must be a very promising thriller. But I expected too much and finally I rate this only five stars out ten. Why? The first half I wait and wait until something special happens. Then the plot is for me not hot enough to get adrenalin. Even the end let me cold and I could only shake my head. The story was even predictable that from the running time of two hours they could have cut at least 30 minutes. Director Martin Scorsese is the specialist to expand movies as he did already in The Aviator or Goodfellas and I definitely don't like extra long films. One sequence remembered me the cartoon of Tom and Jerry playing in the mysterious castle where the brain of the dog is switched in the cat or the sound of bird takes over the elephant and so on if you know what I mean. The dialogs were well adapted to the Fifties and Leonardo Di Caprio delivered here one of his best performance. Ben Kingsley is back again and was very believable in his role. Visually it was good too and the scenery well chosen. Avoid this overrated movie except if you are a Di Caprio fan. See instead the other lighthouse thrillers MURDERS BY NUMBERS or HALF LIGHT. 5/10.,neutral,5,tt1130884
"Okay, after pondering the ending of ""Memento"" for about 20 minutes, I think I've finally got it. Our friend Lenny can't remember anything.  He has to write down everything that's happened to him or it'll just swish down the drain in his mind.  When you watch this movie, you might end up having to do the same thing in order to keep track of what's going on.  Yeah, everything comes together in a neat little surprise ending, but surprise endings aren't always satisfying. Especially when they're way off the wall. A good movie, but overrated.  Next time I want to watch a whodunit, I think I'll go with something more conventional.  ""Along Came A Spider"" came out about the same time and beats this hands-down.

"I view movies differently after seeing this movie, because it broke down doors. Then there's the tiny issue of the story of Fight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk the story is nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the state of the world at the end of the century. ""Fight Club"" an aggressive, confrontational, often brutal satire that is quite possibly a brilliant masterpiece. Taking the ""Choose life,"" anti-consumerism rant at the beginning of ""Trainspotting,"" and carrying it to its logical -- albeit extreme -- conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream film that takes a lot of risks by biting the hand that feeds it. ""Fight Club"" is a $50+ million studio film that remains true to its anti-consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message -- right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame. What makes ""Fight Club"" a subversive delight is not only its refreshing anti-corporate message but how it delivers said message. As Fincher has explained in interviews, you don't really watch the film but rather download it. Its structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an incredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all over the place like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even making a hilarious dead stop to draw attention to itself in a funny, interesting way that completely works. The film is a cinematic punch to the head as it challenges the status quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in a materialistic world where those who have the most stuff, ""win."" I think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all that down, reject corporate monsters like Starbucks and Blockbuster, and try to figure out what we really want out of life. It's almost as if the film is suggesting salvation through self-destruction. And it is these thought-provoking ideas that makes ""Fight Club"" a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens. 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523
"Fight Club: A depressed man (Edward Norton) suffering from insomnia meets a strange soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and soon finds himself living in his squalid house after his perfect apartment is destroyed. The two bored men form an underground club with strict rules and fight other men who are fed up with their mundane lives. Their perfect partnership frays when Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), a fellow support group crasher, attracts Tyler's attention. The movie, which is an adaptation ofChuck Palahniuk's Novel, starts out with Edward Norton's narration about his daily life which was superb as Edwards voice was amazing and really set up the mood for the movie. This introduction is followed by such amazing shots to an extent that the filming might be the best throughout movie history, considering the time it was filmed at. Additionally, the story build-up was superb as the movie never got boring. Edward's performance was truly wonderful especially towards the end and so was Brad Pitt's. Although Helena doesn't do these kinds of roles so much, she perfects the role of Marla. With all this cast together and the magnificent screenplay, the movie was just incrediblely funny and filled with very entertaining fight scenes (well obviously). The last 40 minutes were just amazing. Shocking, slightly confusing, full of exciting plot twists, and action packed. All to one of the best and most tense endings in film history.

"The movie ""The Two Towers"" has got some scenes that are absolutely fantastic - breathtaking (e.g. the arrival of the four heroes at Edoras, the destruction of Isengard, Gollum's monologues etc...) and some very ugly commercialised scenes that only appeal to Americans (e.g. Aragorn's and Arwen's kiss, Gimli's bad jokes and Legolas' skate). New Line must understand that the film is not only out in America but also in Europe and other countries, where the audience are demanding films of greater quality. However, this does not mean that The Two Towers is a bad movie. In fact, it's one of the best movies ever made!!!

"Truly a masterpiece. This is one of those movies which you can watch over and over again and still find it as moving as the first time you watched it. This film can not be replicated, because the film is special; the Director wanted to make a piece of art of his film. The movie has no bad points it's what a story should be about, it takes you somewhere that you never been, and makes you feel you lived that experience, and you can learn from that experience. The lines delivered, will always be remembered 'Get busy living, or get busy dying' (this is the dilemma we face in everyday live).

"Unfortunately, this much-hyped Marvel film fails to live up to the hype. The film surrounds basically all characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (sans Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Wasp) as they must fight to stop an evil villain named Thanos, who wants to destroy half the world's population. Josh Brolin does an impressive job voicing Thanos, working to make him both depraved but also somewhat understandable as well. The visual effects are generally impressive, with the notable exception of Thanos' henchmen, whose CGI looks quite cheesy and almost akin to the villains in ""Justice League."" Unfortunately, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" has an array of flaws. The first flaw is that the movie is almost impossibly convoluted. I consider myself a casual Marvel fan who has seen most MCU movies, and have seen a little over half of them in theaters (Iron Man, Thor, Avengers, Iron Man 3, Thor 2, The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Age of Ultron, Civil War, Black Panther, Infinity War.) I fully acknowledge the fact that I am unlikely to take away as much from this film as a hardcore fan. However, parts of the film were still difficult to follow--and I followed Civil War just fine. Additionally, while the film is ambitious, it is just unfortunately too overstuffed. There are too many characters and subplots to care about, so much that the audience becomes less engaged in the story until late in the narrative. I believe it would have been better to sort of ""split up"" some non-primary characters between this movie and 2019's ""Avengers 4."" This would allow for audiences to take away more from the two films. While the action is generally thrilling, it lacks a scene that feels wholly unique as compared to other superhero films. The climactic battle in Wakanda shown in the trailers, while a good scene, is pretty similar to other ""large-scale people running"" type battles in movies like the Lord of the Rings series. I guess I was hoping for an action piece that felt really unique to the specific movie itself like Civil War's airport scene or Black Panther's Busan car chase scene. I will not give away any details about the ending, although I will say that it didn't work for me and made it hard for me to suspend disbelief. Due to its overstuffed nature and overtly convoluted plot, I cannot say this film met my expectations. 5/10 Note: I saw this movie in IMAX 3D. The picture and sound quality were both very good, although the 3D was weak and did not really add anything.",neutral,5,tt4154756
"The same with Mark Hamill. The good things: Good concept, nice plot, very good SFX (though not as good as in 2001, at least in my opinion), good score (though Willams is generally overrated) and acting of Harrison Ford and especially Alec Guiness. Now, the minuses. 1) The dialogue. Childish. 2) Logic. When you look at the Empire soldiers you wonder :How is it possible that with a bunch of such unskilled, stupid and poorly trained idiots it managed to defeat the Republic. It's a mystery. Lucas could hire Stevie Wonder or Ray Charles, and at least then I would understand why none of them managed to wound any of our heroes. Come on it's not that difficult; Rosie O'Donnel would be worse target. They were supposed to be the best soldiers in the galaxy (I believe OWK said sth like that). 3) And now for the acting. Mark Hamill is just an annoying piece of wood, but Carrie Fisher...... arrrgh. The best part is when Alderaan is blown up. The reaction of Leia is not ""I will kill you"", ""You b******s"", ""Nooooooooooo"" , no cry, no despair. It's just ""ahh"" (or sth like that). Come on lady! It's not as if Darth Vader said ""You can't go for a date, go to your room"" or ""No, I'm sorry, I can't give you my car tonight, daddy needs it"". Your home planet has just been destroyed, billions of innocent people died, your family was probably there!!! Show something!!! Curse! Shout! Cry! Spit at his face! Kill Lucas (that would be the best idea)! Burn the Empire flag as a sign of protest! But for God's sake don't act as if somebody has just bought the dress you wanted. Now I hope that the plans for the remake of 'Casablanca' will change, as Ben and J.Lo should rather try in this one. They'd definitely win hands down. And finally, I can't believe it's #9 in Top250, especially when you see so many incredible movies below (Empire Strikes Back #15, Matrix #33, 2001 #58(!!!!), Alien #64, Blade Runner #80, to mention sci-fi only).

"...yep, it's a guy movie all right. ""The Fast and the Furious"" is the movie that made street racing popular (at least here in The Netherlands it did) But is it good movie? I think not, i found it pretty disappointing, maybe it was because I set my expectations for it too high. The movie is nothing more then a remake of ""Point Break"" with cars, set in the 00's and is aimed at the teenage viewers. The story is pretty simple and to be honest I didn't liked it, I wanted to see more racing instead of focusing on the undercover mission of Brian. So basically I'm saying that the movie would have been better if it didn't had a story at all! The characters and the atmosphere can be described as ""cool"". I actually like the acting in this one and I'm one of the few people who thinks that Vin Diesel is actually a pretty talented actor that just wastes his talent by playing only cool macho guys. Watch ""Saving Private Ryan"" to understand what I'm talking about. And Ja Rule actually acts better then he sings, but I don't know if that's a compliment. The car scene's are all right but it didn't gave me the adrenaline rush I wanted and the were to little race scene's for my taste. The movie does have it's moments, but overall it's disappointing. All in all only watchable if you like cool cars and fast racing. I just hope that the second one will be better. 4/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",negative,4,tt0232500
"It's certainly a unique concept. Leonard, played by Guy Pearce, is a man who has no short-term memory after being attacked when trying to save his wife from a rape-murder. The rest of his life is spent in a quest for revenge - a revenge he can't remember if he's ever been able to achieve because he has no short-term memory. That's an interesting enough premise, the added piece here being the decision to offer us the story in reverse chronology - beginning with Leonard killing the man he believes to be his wife's killer (played by Joe Pantoliano) and then scene by scene retracing the story, going back just a bit at a time to fill in the details of his search, and how he came to the conclusion that Teddy was responsible. Essentially, then, the viewer is pulled into Leonard's own condition - seeing what's happening with no clue as to how it came about because we haven't seen what came before. Edited into the regression scenes are black and white scenes in which Leonard, holed up in his hotel room, essentially talks about his condition and seems to fill in some essential details about his past. It's an interesting way to present a ""whodunit"" - because the question all the way through is whether Teddy is actually the killer. The ending offers up a twist - although it isn't the biggest surprise you'll ever see, if only because the way the movie is put together you're conditioned from the beginning to expect pretty much any twist possible, it still leaves open a decent bit of uncertainty about who actually killed Lenny's wife. So, the premise and construction of the story is interesting enough. Also interesting, though, is that - while it's intriguing - I just didn't find it particularly enjoyable to watch. Perhaps it's because I didn't buy Leonard's condition - for one reason. He used photographs to jog his memory, so he took pictures of important people, places, etc,. to refer to when necessary. What's wrong with that? Well - nothing, I suppose, except that I found it passing strange that, for a guy who supposedly forgets everything within a couple of minutes of it happening, he always knew exactly which pocket to find the pictures in. He NEVER had to search for one of his photographs; there was never even a moment of hesitation when he had to refer to one. That's a small point, perhaps, but it caused a bit of a credibility gap for me. The movie's well acted by the leads and interesting enough as the pieces of the puzzle are sorted out, but for me it fizzled a bit on that admittedly relatively small point. 5/10",neutral,5,tt0209144
"I have seen a few Christopher Nolan films before, but never one like this. I am typically not a fan of movies with a nonlinear screenplay, but this one had me hooked from start to finish. Maybe it was the ever changing use of black and white and color, and beginning a scene with how a previous one ended, helping to tie them together, that did it for me. I am not entirely sure to be honest, but all I know for sure is that this film is brilliant. This movie revolves around the main character, Leonard Shelby and his hunt to find the killer and rapist of his wife. In contrast to this, he has a disability with his memory, known to be anterograde amnesia, which keeps him from forming any new memories prior to his wife's death. He must now use his skills through notes and tattoos to help him solve his case. Throughout this story he meets several people, such as Teddy, Natalie and more, and it is his job to determine if they can be trusted. I believe it is the cinematography of this film that caused it to carry itself so strongly. This is a film that could easily become confusing, but the use of the black and white for a chronological order of events and color for events happening in reverse order. Personally, I found this to be clever and interesting, seeing as even though these opposing scenes do not happen in the same order as one another, they line up perfectly and prompt the progression of the story. I do believe the use of these scenes align perfectly with the main issue the characters in the movie face: Leonard's memory loss. Not only was the plot phenomenal, but everything else that went into the film was seemingly on point to me. The acting was amazing in every aspect, leaving the audience hooked. Every piece of clothing was extremely helpful in the development of the story, from scene to scene, leaving viewers such as myself wondering what the reasoning for this was from the beginning. I also found repetition in music based on certain scenes, which helped me to put things in order. From this film, I took the idea that not everything is as it seems and the mind can be deceiving. This sounds vague, but you would have to watch the movie to see what I mean. I do believe that after viewing, you will look at things more clearly... just hopefully not in the form of notes as tattoos. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good brain stump or mind twist essentially. Or, if you are looking for a movie that will simply keep you on your toes, I can guarantee you have found it. Christopher Nolan did a beautiful job in the portrayal of Momento, and now I will forever wish I could just watch it for the first time again. Overall rating: 9.5/10 stars!",neutral,5,tt0209144

It currently ranks at #33 on the IMDb top 250, so you can understand why my mind was blown when an IMDb user actually called this movie ""underappreciated"".  The truth is that it's OVERappreciated.  ""Fight Club"" is not the groundbreaking, sensational work of genius many fans call it.  There aren't any stagerringly original ideas, apart from Fight Club itself.

At around fifty years old, it outshines many modern films. With performances by Brando, Pacino, and Castellano, among others, the acting is phenomenal.

Nolan once again selects an all star cast to create compelling characters that we can care about. Although the plot is basically a traditional good guys vs. bad guys routine, the movie is chock-full of character quirks and situational complexities that lend themselves toward the unfolding of not a typical action-thriller, but rather a comprehensive work of art.

"Rewatch this adventure from my favorite director Nolan. The first time that I watched it, which was long ago, I remembered not getting the full story, so I didn't think it was a masterpiece, although I did like it. However, this time was quite different. I was hooked right away within the opening scene, which showed the dream within a dream sequence that introduced the premise very well. Then, as the characters showed more about the movie's universe, I was so amazed with the cinematography, like the scene where the dream world was flip into half up and down. The story itself was complicated and required me to stay focused. Since I got some memories of when I first watched the movie, I did not struggle too much to fully grasp what was going on. This was for sure not as complicated as Tenet. With the story, Nolan dived into the human subconscious and applied the Freudian psychology. Overall, a total blast for the whole 2.5 hours. This is definitely one of Nolan's best masterpieces. 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt1375666
"Compelling, fantastically acted, and superbly well written- The Shawshank Redemption can certainly be a slow ride- but one far worth the wait. Tim Robbins gives a tremendous and extremely underrated performance as Andy Dufresne, truly capturing the emotion, atmosphere, and pain that is all involved in a life of prison. Morgan Freeman also gives a rather good performance as well, and Robbins and him together make for quite a unique pair- not to mention their terrific chemistry. The film is very cleverly shot, and it housed to some of the greatest cinematic story elements (at least by the end) in film history. The biggest problem with The Shawshank Redemption is its criminally slow pace, which is by all means, reasonable, considering how long the characters have been in the prison, but you can't help but feel there is something missing as you stare bored at the screen in those moments- wondering if the writers, directors, or producers could have done just a little extra something to spice it up. In the end however, The Shawshank Redemption is a really good adaptation of King's work, and is clever in so many ways. It's performances are fantastic, especially from Robbins and Freeman, and may feel a bit dragged out, but contains some truly captivating moments.

"An incredible movie and brilliantly written and directed by Christopher Nolan who's just a legend and inspiration to most filmmakers. I can admit it's confusing at times, but you just completely forget it when you're surrounded by the incredible experience of both stunning audio and visuals with the music by Hans Zimmer and IMAX shoulder legend, Hoyte van hoytema. The acting is just phenomenal with so many breathtaking and heartfelt moments, especially between Cooper (Matthew.m) and Murph (Mackenzie Foy/Jessica Chastain). The ending is a bit depressing but it's so poetically beautiful. I would recommend giving this movie a watch if you haven't seen it already

"Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959) 5 word summary Aliens turn zombies against humans I don't understand how this movie got so popular. It's not good and its not that bad. I watched this expecting a terrible film that I would sit and laugh at, but really I just sat back and watched it. I didn't enjoy it but I didn't think it was as miserable as everyone has said. I found old horror films like Attack of the Giant Leeches or The Creeping Terror much worse and much more deserving of criticism. The directing and acting is no worse in Plan 9 than most of the other low budget horror/ sci-fi films of the time that I've seen, I'm just confused as to why this one got the spotlight Directing, acting, writing etc, all are tolerable but it's just not bad enough or good enough to really enjoy that much. It's a little boring, but really, as I mentioned, it is tolerable. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone unless you are a big Ed Wood fan or you just want to see what all the fuss is about. 5/10",neutral,5,tt0052077
"Got to take in the Midnight show of ""Batman Begins"" this evening with Ms. Addiction. Felt like writing up a little review, per the norm, so here we go. Batman is back with a vengeance. In what could quite possibly be the greatest casting in comic book movie history, virtual unknown, Christian Bale's performance single handily breathed new life back into the once downward spiraling super hero franchise. From the opening of the film, and the new DC Comics logo, I knew all in attendance were in for a treat. ""Batman Begins"" serves as a prequel to the 1989 live action film that started it all, directed by Tim Burton. In ""Begins"", we're treated to a solid hour of Bruce Wayne's chronology and how the bat came to fruition. Introduced are Alfred (Michael Caine) as well as Wayne's parents via a series of flashbacks, cut in with present day episodes. These, a la ""Godfather 2"", clued viewers in to the origins and birth of the Dark Knight. Intense training montages between Bale and the always impressive Liam Neeson were just the beginning, dazzling to watch accompanied by the breathtaking landscapes. Act two weaves a story of how Wayne's once industrious hometown of Gotham City has become overrun by crime and violence, in desperate need of a heroic savior. Wayne, a supposed avid spelunker, stumbles upon a cave under his age old mansion, there, learning to embrace his fears, giving birth to his alter-ego, and thus finding motivation to save his hometown. Enter shady individuals like crime boss Falcone, and Jonathan Crane, aka ""Scarecrow"", brilliantly portrayed by ""28 Days Later"" star Cillian Murphy. Always looming in the background is Wayne's love interest, Rachel, played by Katie Holmes. While his guilt is outweighed by something else, Bale digs deep to take the law into his own hands, while exorcising his personal demons, ridding Gotham of the infestation. What surprised me most about the film was how it felt less like the colorful, flashy, quippy comic book films were so used to. Batman was indeed dark, back to the Burton way of things, Only this time, he's got the machismo, the cunning, and the inner anger that the character was so sorely lacking. Bale equals perfection, as I said. In addition, he was surrounded by absolute Grade A supporting talents. Morgan Freeman, Katie Holmes, Michael Caine, Ken Watanabe, Liam Neeson, Rutger Hauer, Gary Oldman! It's a dream cast, and it flowed like such. The collective was absolutely incredible. The films presentation was also very intriguing, giving Batman a complexity to go with the newly uncovered origins. My complaints are VERY few and far between, and lie mainly in chronology and continuity. If this were to serve as a prequel to the Burton original, there are flaws in the time line. In the original Batman, his parents were killed in 1922. Then in Burton's film, it was closer to 1955, then in ""Begins"", it had to be around 1997, as there was clearly a Black 1999 Oldsmobile Aurora at Wayne Manor for the funeral, meaning ""Begins"" was actually taking place closer to 2010-2015? This was never really cleared up. Also, if Chill killed Wayne's parents, was Jack Napier lying in Burton's ""Batman""? Overall, I can say that this is easily the best cast comic book film of all time, and quite possibly the best Super Hero film I've ever seen. The adult theme worked, and was a welcome change. I'm glad to see Christopher Nolan resurrect the Bat, salvaging its dignity, with David Goyer's redeeming co-writing, after the atrocity that was ""Blade: Trinity"". 9.5/10 Batarangs..",neutral,5,tt0372784
"As an Films Studies student from London. Watching this film was one of the most exciting thrill that ever happened to me. The powerful use of script and the Cinematography used to shoot the scenes were perfect and powerful. The first sequence of the film grips the audiences attention that this is not about brutal murders or shooting people without reason but involves discipline and symbolises the role played by Vito Corleone as being like a senator or a president when people come to help. I have watched this film more than 20 times and still don't get bored of it. If you want to compare it with Citizen Cane or Scarface, you can't. Because its too artistic and a perfect film for a gangster/crime hybrid film. When Al Pacino's role changes the film creates more suspense and concern on how he would run the family, but everyone then believes in him and he then becomes the next Godfather. This film is one of the best film ever to be made. Perfect in the way it starts and subsequently the ending as well, if you haven't watch this film didn't understand the concept of it, then don't bother watching films. This is the best film ever to be made...10/10",positive,10,tt0068646
"This is a crappy film that tries to combine bunch of crappy skits into a movie with the main story going on as an excuse. It's like the makers of this movie just thought up an idea to make a malicious, messed up, grotesque, repulsive and vulgar into a comedy that just isn't funny. And this movie has a lot of messed up moments but it's just not funny. Few parts is I guess slightly humorous but the rest of it is just trash. And the origin of how this movie got started is laughable. Especially since I thought this movie might have a chance because of all the well known actors and actresses that are in it. This movie is just not worth the time, go see ""42"" instead. 3.3/10",negative,3,tt1333125
"Ed Wood must have been a fascinating man. He had a burning drive and ambition to succeed in the film industry, yet his creative and directorial talents were infantile. Plan 9 is his most famous film and has become a cult favourite. The film is an example of extreme amateurism which creates an assortment of unintentionally funny scenes. It's truly amazing this film managed to be funded and released to the public (then again, The Swarm was too ). Within Plan 9's ridiculous and convoluted story are a number of silly subplots due to the fact that Ed had such a variety of interesting an un-related footage which he really, really wanted to use in the one film. One needs to pay close attention to understand everything that's going on in this mess (although, when you do understand everything that's going on, you may wish you'd have remained ignorant!) Plan 9 has heaps of priceless quirks: hub-cap flying saucers, idiotic dialogue, the last gasp of the great Bella Lugosi, and the luscious Vampira (who apparently would have breached an existing contract if she uttered a word in Plan 9). One of the most interesting aspects of Plan 9 is the great variation in performance techniques by the actors. Some speak their lines like they know the script is idiotic while some speak their lines like they don't understand them (which is possible because some of the dialogue uttered by the bumbling aliens doesn't make any sense). But my favourite character is the airline captain played by Gregory Walcott. Greg's a real trooper and attempts to take his role very, very seriously despite the constant lunacy around him. How did he remain so professional? Did he imagine his role in Plan 9 would lead to greater things? Although Ed Wood has been voted by the US film industry as the worst director in history, he lives on as a kind of cult anti-hero. As a director then, he has achieved a level of lasting success. 6/10  For fun value.",neutral,6,tt0052077
"Normally when a franchise is very famous with some loyal fans, they hype up the movie a little more than it should be which makes the movie underwhelming when it's watched by a person who has never seen it before. However, Lord of the Rings didn't disappoint. The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which has been lost for centuries. Powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), who inherits the Ring and steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer - to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged. From a beautiful and magical world to a very dark one, alongside the amazing costume design, the movie is visually stunning. It takes us on a huge adventure that you'd never get bored of. Throughout the whole 3 hours run time, the story is very engaging and entertaining. It takes a bit of time to figure out what's actually happening and how the whole thing was caused, but after that moment of realization, you could never stop watching. The script is written in an amazing way; making the people who have never read the books understand what is going on while not being solely informative and boring. The characters are also very well developed and the audience is able to build a connection to those characters. Additionally, the cast was immaculate as all the actors fit perfectly for their respective roles. To conclude, the first chapter of the Lord of The Rings movies succeeds as an amazing movie based on a novel. Score:8.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0120737

"If you're someone who was born in 2000s and have watched cinema as a normal person does, you might have seen the adaptions of the same storyline a lot of times with better graphics, action, soundtrack. And then this movie ain't gonna be any different for you. It might have been revolutionary for its time because it brought a new storyline in the world of cinema, but now I have seen this exact narrative so many times, it's predictable for me. So for me, it was a 6/10. Actually it was somewhat disappointing because seeing a rating of 9.2 I was expecting my mind to be blown away.

"Inception Every once in a while you catch a film so incredibly intense that it blows you right back into your seat. This could be through a well crafted idea perfectly told through a potent medium of clever narrative, or through the sheer awe of mind-blowing visual effects. It is true that in terms of ratio, the latter is by far a more heavily relied on tool these days. You can attribute this to lazy directing or to the fickle nature of the modern ""cinema crowd"". But why can we not have both? Who says that the balance between spectacle and substance must be measured with all of the even handedness of a North Korean general election? Indeed this was a question that troubled me for some time and with the putrid presence of teeny trash fad ""Twilight"" ever looming it seemed as though all was lost. But alas I forgot one man, the ever brilliant Christopher Nolan. In 2008 he had more than a vision of a deep, yet thoroughly entertaining summer blockbuster. He was on a mission, a mission to bridge the gap between intellectual indie cinema and the elaborate glamour of Hollywood. With the success of the Dark Knight he proved such a feat achievable and set himself a stage to deliver something a little more personal. Thus we arrived at ""Inception"" an intricate and complex journey into our very dreams. From the offset we are thrown into the world of ""Dominic Cobb"" (DiCaprio) a agent or ""extractor"" who through complicated futuristic technology is able to delve into our dreams and extract our secrets. estranged from general society and hiding from the law, Cobb is given the opportunity to clear his name and return to his life if he performs a very specific type of dream infiltration, ""Inception"". Despite objections from his associates that the concept of inception, or inputting ideas into another's dreams is impossible, Cobb takes up the task and the plot inevitable thickens. Some may say the plot was already thick enough, it is not Nolan's style to explain all of the in and out workings of the idea, he only asks that the audience embraces it long enough to deduce it for themselves. There are those who will find this too much effort and will walk out confused and frightened in the first half an hour, there are those who will wrestle tirelessly with the plot in a vein effort to understand it and there are of course those smartarses who will effortlessly understand every word as it is said and will be filled with a arrogant sense of superiority because of it. (These people are second only on the list of irritable muppets to those who pretend to understand it on first input). The category which you fall into is irrelevant, as long as you open yourself up to the idea and absorb what you can you are pretty likely to walk away from this film enlightened in some respect. as I said, this is Nolan's bridge between substance and spectacle and when given the chance can dramatically transform your expectations. The energy put into this film by both the on screen cast (particularly DiCaprio and Murphy) and the production crew are simply breathtaking and show that when combined, a visionary director, a clever story, surreal special effects and a A-list cast can really piece together a modern masterpiece. 9.1/10 Sam Lockett",negative,1,tt1375666

"'The Godfather' remains compelling viewing after all these years. Directed masterfully by Francis Ford Coppola, the film shows the control of a mafia family passing from Marlon Brando to his reluctant son Al Pacino. The opening segment is brilliant as it introduces all the main characters. The acting is superb across the board with Brando winning a richly deserved Best Actor Oscar for his highly nuanced portrayal of Don Vito Corleone.

"LOTR is ""okish"".  I gave it 4/10.  There were a few good action scenes but ultimately it is over-long and actually quite boring.  It doesn't do much to make an actual movie out of the book, and I know it is part 1 of a trilogy, but they could at least have engineered some form of ending rather than just stopping the movie dead. There isn't much else to say....before you believe this is the ""best movie ever made"" simply have a look at the comment history of anyone who comments here saying it is.  Mmmm...look at that, they've all only ever reviewed LOTR. This is the ultimate case of ""the Emperor's new clothes"" as the movie really has little going for it.

Granted my most recent cinematic experience of the Caped Crusader was on the extremely impressive I.M.A.X. cinema screen. I went to see the film the first time on day of release, and came away from it thinking that I had experienced quite a spectacle. Yes the reviews where all brightly glowing, but even still it was above expectations. Everybody in the movie played their part extremely well, from the leads to the support. The plot was clever and complex enough that it got the old grey matter working. The direction, score and script were top drawer, the overall feel of quality throughout was second to none. I have to say experiencing the film on the giant I.M.A.X screen enhanced the viewing pleasure even further. The scene's they filmed with the I.M.A.X. camera's looked quite simply EPIC. 10/10 no flaws in my opinion.

"Avengers: Infinity War is not a terrible movie. Let me make this very clear. It is shot well, it has some very interesting set pieces and plot direction and it continues the Avengers storyline in a fairly compelling way. So why is it disappointing? Why am I dropping a 6/10 on this thing? Overload. Avengers: Infinity War simply has too much going on. There is a persistent element of urgency to everything happening in the film but there are so many characters, plot pieces to connect, settings and motivations that it just gets to be a mess. You're never really given enough time to make emotional connections to any of the characters in the film (except a few but this is spoiler free) so the plot feels superficial even though the stakes are supposedly very high. If you haven't kept up on all of the Marvel movies prior to watching Avengers: Infinity War you're going to end up sitting through a film constantly wondering why various characters aren't given any characterization whatsoever. There really is very little growth or development of any character in this film despite major events happening to quite a few of them. If this sounds paradoxical its because it is. You've got characters experiencing personal quests/journeys separate from everyone else, for which the outcomes are generally predictable. You've got major plot elements that are also predictable but designed to pull the emotional strings even though they're thrown at you rapid-fire. It isn't a terrible movie. But it certainly isn't a great movie. Avengers: Infinity War is a solid 6/10. I enjoyed watching it but only really because, like many, I am very invested in the Marvel stories at this point and I want to see how it ends. I've seen it twice and I likely won't go out of my way to see it a third time.",neutral,6,tt4154756
"The Intouchables (2011) :
Brief Review - This French cinema sensation is too easy to predict but the true story factor still makes it work. The Intouchables is based on a true story of an quadriplegic rich man who finds a true friend in one of his hired reckless caretaker. The film is a big story but definitely it is time consuming as the narrative is strictly modified within 112 minutes. There is fun, there is love, there is life, there are problems and then there is a friendship bond and humanity values. I won't deny the fact that the story isn't overwhelming at all, of course it is predictable and too simple. But sometimes simple things works. The problem i have with the film is the hype creted by audience about it. When i am watching a film with IMDb Rating of 8.5/10 and also the Rank 44 film in IMDb Top Rated Films WW i expect something sensational or outstanding and this predictable tale is surely underwhelming by far. Critics didn't admire this film as much as audience and i would like to go with critics for this film (I always don't agree with Critics) at least. The Intouchables lacks the attractive elements but it is Highly entertaining flick by all means. It has laughters on consistent basis. Some of them are vulgar, some are organic and some are outdated but that all keeps it engaging. Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy put up fine performances and lovable chemistry. The background score works pleasantly while Cinematography is okay. Olivier Nakace and Eric Toodano has made a very good film but looking at all the acclaim it recieved globally it is certainly below my expectations. Maybe attending the biographical story didn't let them use cinematic Liberty upto the course but i have seen so many Biographicals being one of the greatest films of all time, haven't you? There is definitely something less in the film but if you can neglect that then there's lot to enjoy in The Untouchables for sure. RATING - 7/10* By - #samthebestest",neutral,5,tt1675434
"Story: Leia a rebellion princess in distress send out a note for help through one of her robots. That robot goes out to get help to overthrow some villains and restore freedom in the galaxy. Analysis: first time ever watching this franchise. Even though this film seems to be targeted at you children. Sometimes the words used might not make sense to the young ones. There is a lot of violence including implied torture and genocide is committed. Which is probably where this movie fails. Not making a clear choice for its audience. In some scenes limbs are dismembered, and a total planet with millions destroyed, whilst the acting, decor are presented in a way that is not serious, but rather aimed at kids. And then they add in (for kids) boring planet politics). Acting & Dialogue: 3/10 childish. This franchise is enjoyed by many (adults). But it lacks a serious tone, even though there are extremely graphic gruesome scenesin the movie. Visuals (Decor): 7/10 whilst not perfect, effort has been made to make the sets other worldly. Costume, Make up & Props: 8/10 a product of its time, but iconic, so hard to judge poorly. The robots look good and still hold up today. Stand out are the light beam swords Special Effects: 8/10 the dinosaurs and some of the species look stunning, especially for the time. But some of it looks like a cheap puppet show. And again the light beams and lasers aged pretty well. Characters: 5.0 /10 the most memorable is a British speaking golden camp robot (Android) with cheezy and rude lines. They are paired up with a hoover looking robot who he always seems to arguing with. Even though the latter seems smarter and kinder. In same ways the camp Droid has more character then the main heroe character. Another one is Darth Vader who immediately comes across as a meanie. He is acted by David Prowse, but sounds a lot like King Jaffe Jofer from 'Coming To America'. He looks cool, but he is mostly just walking around the set. And he looks out of place for most of it. Looking at all the characters it's only fair to conclude that most are one dimensionals, with maybe a pair of two dimensional characters (Obi Wan) it seems the charactershave gotten little thought. None of the characters is fully fleshed out nor do they seem to have a lot of feeling. When characters find out family members have died, not even a tear is shed. So redemption for the characters, as they are memorable and iconic. Even though they lack dept. Music: 6/10 it compliments the story, the main theme is the only real stand out. Overall assessment: it's ok, it tapes into the watch base of people that like space, science fiction and fantasy, but lacks heart. It's a surprise it did so well. And still does today. It is very rough around the edges and makes many error. Why it is pointless to diss a movie that is so beloved. One wonders how much the nostalgia glasses are shaping the high appreciation today, but it doesn't hold up well in comparison to other older movies like Alien for example.",negative,3,tt0076759
"I have never fallen asleep at the cinema, but The Matrix is the closest I've ever come to doing so.  Quite frankly, the first hour of this film is the most boring hour of film ever. Keanu Reeves cannot act, neither can Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Ann Moss doesn't do much better.  The whole thing is too dark, and let's be honest: If you've seen the trailer, you don't need to see the film, as it shows you all the special effects there anyway. I've been more disappointed by other films, but I fail to see how this uninspiring and badly acted mess is hailed so much by fans.  Any old fool can string together a series of special effects, the trick is to link them with a good story and enjoyable characters.  The Matrix does neither.

"I always look forward to a new Star Wars film. Obviously, in recent years we've seen a reawakening of these films and I've really loved it all. Solo went through a bit of turmoil getting made as the director changed a way into production. Ron Howard is a very hit or miss filmmaker, I haven't liked anything he made in the last decade (not counting that Beatles documentary because its impossible to mess that up). The Solo trailers grew on me as I watched more clips of it and I considered myself hyped for it. Its a good thing I don't care for what other established critics said about this film because I had an enjoyable time. The film follows a young Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich) in his early days. Han is an eager but talented pilot who finds himself in a situation where he must deliver a super fuel called coaxium to an evil lord named Dryden Vos. He aligns himself with a a thieving man named Tobias Beckett, a former lover named Qi'ra, a furry companion pilot named Chewbacca, and a smuggler named Lando Calrissian. The film also stars Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke and Donald Glover as a young Lando. I'm very happy that this film didn't disappoint me. The film has such smooth battles, space chases, and action sequences. The CGI and effects all around look good here which makes it a joy to watch. I wasn't sold on Alden Ehrenreich as Solo when I first saw the trailer but I think he does a decent enough job. Bettany's Vos isn't really a unique villain and falls into a cliche of overbearing screaming villain. I don't think Emilia Clarke is a great actress but she's alright here. After all, lets not forgot how horrendous Natalie Portman was in the prequels. The sound effects and costume design is super as well. The film isn't as humorous as other recent Star Wars entries but I liked that. I think it was nice to see a young Han Solo, the troubles he got into, and how he came to be who he is. Of course, everyone and their mother is a fan of Donald Glover now but I've been a super fan of his since his Community days and his early Chlidish Gambino stuff. Liked him quite a bit as Lando. I don't know about a Lando stand alone film but I'm sure he can find his away into a future Star Wars anthology film. I read some critics really trashing this film. There's one (who I won't name) that loves to rate big budget films very lowly with and I'm starting to think its an agenda over him actually trying to enjoy or genuinely analyze what he sees. This film is not the best Star Wars film by any stretch. Its better than all three prequels and is a notch below Rogue One for me. Its not a perfect film, and could have used a stronger plot. Sure. The film still manages to carry that great Star Wars feel and provides non stop visuals, action, and adventure. Go there and stop expecting a storytelling masterpiece and you will enjoy this. 7.5/10",neutral,5,tt3778644
"On the outside, Frank Darabont's directorial piece de resistance does not look promising: Scripts purloined from little-known Stephen King novellas, hacked up and padded with sentimental Hollywood schmaltz do not tend to yield cinematic gold. King, a master of unnerving, psychological drama would never be so trite as to tag one of his stories with a vague, syrupy axiom like 'Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.'  that kind of corny meddling smacks of the ad men tugging mercilessly at the heart strings, ripping the freshness and originality out of every project they come across. I am also immediately wary of prison melodramas (especially those with the word 'redemption' in the title)  they are all so predictable. These were my thoughts as I first contemplated watching The Shawshank Redemption almost a decade ago. Then there was nothing like the hype and fervour that surround the movie now. I had only the rapturous, breathless testimony of a friend of mine to go on, and he was something of a philistine when it came to the pictures (I believe his previous favourite film was Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, so you can forgive my scepticism). Still I did some research before going in: Yup, thought so: Idealistic young man, banged up for a crime he didn't commit  I'll bet he soon bears the brunt of some pent-up sexual aggression from his misanthropic fellow inmates. What's that? He befriends an institutionalised black guy played by Morgan Freeman? I would imagine he'll be providing a wise voice-over throughout, perhaps whimsically tinged with an ingenuous Southern drawl. And the Warden: He'll be a stern, God-fearing fellow with steel-rimmed spectacles and a shady secret. I went along and watched it anyway of course (my social diary as a teenager was hardly cram-full) and as I sat, I soon realized I was right on all counts. But still I watched. Past the grim depictions of new recruits being raped and beaten by both guard and lag; past the scene on the roof with the insurance advice and the ice-cold beers; past the bittersweet tale of Brooksy's freedom and Tommy Williams' fateful revelations. I watched through the ever-changing posters on Andy Dufresne's wall, and at the end I, like everybody else in the cinema emerged blinking, dry-of-mouth and my heart soaring. Teenagers aren't supposed to be awash with optimism and joy. They slouch and scowl and lock themselves in their rooms with the stereo on full blast, but, despite myself, I couldn't take the big soppy grin off my face or shake the shiver from my spine. After watching The Shawshank Redemption, I smiled so hard my cheeks ached. Because what cynical young sods like me didn't realize was that some films are formulaic for a reason. You cannot reinvent the wheel every time. What I also learnt was that redemption (when it is done right) can be the most moving and satisfying cinematic theme of them all. Shawshank excels in its simplicity. It is by no means the only great prison drama: Cool Hand Luke oozes, well cool, but the young Paul Newman was such a screen god that the film ends up being more of a slavish homage. Other prison revenge flicks (Murder in the First and Sleepers spring to mind) are more obsessed with action or courtroom finger pointing than any thoughtful resolution and the protagonists are bitter and angry. Not here. The characterisation is crisp yet understated. Tim Robbins' Dufresne draws empathy and respect in equal measure, while Freeman's Red has an extraordinary dignity. When we meet him, he has served 20 years for a murder he committed as a kid and any angst and aggression has gradually ebbed away. Now he is revered as 'a man who can get things.' Inside his ability to procure contraband has made him influential  much more so than he ever was as a free man  but instead of using it to bully and menace his fellow cons, he sits back in quiet reflection. This is Red's redemption. Dufresne meanwhile has a grander plan and it comes to fruition in the most splendid fashion. Unusually, we see it all through Red's eyes and that leaves us as wide-eyed and incredulous as the warden after he throws the pebble through Raquel Welsh's midriff. I am not usually in favour of the retrospective voice-over. It is a lazy, mawkish device that is all to often used to paper over plot holes or lack of imagination. This one is different. I suppose it is all in the voice and Freeman sounds like he has been gargling with a heady mixture of rich New England soil and spitting whiskey. It is quiet but wholly convincing  much more so than his subsequent authoritative Presidential ramblings in Deep Impact. The language he uses is easy and uncomplicated but breathtakingly effective: 'His first night in the joint, Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes. He never made a sound,' he says when the new convict refuses to buckle, wryly encapsulating the intricacies of a friendship based on a mutual respect and true affection. Who will ever forget Red as an old man 'so excited I can hardly sit still or hold a thought in my head' as he shuffles along the stone wall in the cornfield towards the big oak tree and Andy's hidden treasure  a true moment of silver screen magic. 'Get busy livin', or get busy dyin',' is the final maxim, and by that stage, no matter how cold or hard-nosed you purport to be, I defy you not to have a lump in your throat. Maybe for once the ad men got it right. 10/10",positive,10,tt0111161
"IMDb Top 250: 27 Seven, David Fincher's first great film, is about two detectives in an unnamed city who hunt down a serial killer who uses the Seven Deadly Sins as his modus operandi. It's an original and clever take on the murder mystery. When those opening credits start to roll, with an awesome remix of Nine Inch Nail's 'Closer', the viewer begins to both dread what will come next, but also be unable to wait to see how it unfurls. A very important part of Seven is its setting and atmosphere. The city, unnamed intentionally, is a savage, crime-riddled town that no one wants to live in. It sets the perfect landscape for such a bizarre killer. The direction is wonderful: constant rain, dark; this is a sad, dreary place, and no good can possibly come of it. It's one of Seven's greatest strengths. Another great strength is the three major players. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the rookie and the veteran, and both are very convincing. Pitt, a five year veteran elsewhere, comes to the city intentionally with his girlfriend. We feel his unpreparedness, especially early on. He doesn't know what to expect from this dreary place; his reaction to the vomit and him waiting for Somerset outside the Gluttony murder, in the rain soaking with two coffees proves that. While some criticize Pitt's acting at the end, I think he aces it. Freeman doesn't have as hard a job, he is the perfect smart and wise character. The last player is the killer, who I will keep a secret. From the killer's entrance to finish, you will be on edge as long as the character is on the screen. The lack of emotion is unsettling. Visually, the film stands out: colours are seeped out of the picture, leaving darkness and rain: a great example is in the alley, with cameras facing up the guns barrel into the rain. The last key to Seven's success is the plot. Full of action, suspense, and a few jumps, you will be engrossed by this story till its intense, shocking finale. Each of the killings are well-thought and shown in a gory, visceral matter, but not explicitly so. Sloth and Lust are absolutely atrocious in a good way, but I think Pride could have been fleshed out a little more. That could be the only suggestion I have about the film. The less you know going into Seven, the better. One of the 90's best. 9.6/10",neutral,6,tt0114369

"I've never been into comic book movies really, aside from I watched the first Spiderman out of boredom once. But I've never seen a Batman film or comic or anything really. I saw the trailer for this movie a while back on YouTube, and I got half curious about it. I decided I wanted to see it after my friend saw it and came online with comments of absolutely AMAZING and left him buzzing after. So me and a friend made arrangements to see it yesterday. From start to finish, this movie keeps you locked in. Heath Ledgers performance as The Joker truly stunned me, it gave me (and my friend) chills up our spines. He wasn't just acting on the surface (which most actors do), he was inside the character, it was amazing. He played the character without fault. The story never becomes boring in parts, never goes too fast or too slow, and never ceases to amaze. I'm prone to getting bored in films, especially something like the cinema when I can't get up and fidget (I don't like staying still for too long), but this... It was amazing. A definite must see. A definite 10/10.",positive,10,tt0468569
"Why this is so popular absolutely baffles me. It only beat The Phantom Menace for best special effects because of politics, to show that George Lucas ""supposedly"" doesn't have so much clout. How anybody can get off on a bunch of skinny dorks in S+M outfits beating each other up with trick photography while techno music constantly plays in the background is beyond me. This is the MTV generations' wet dream, that much is obvious. Comparing it to Blade Runner is trying way too hard. And those of you trying to make something religious out of it, this is all I have to say: get a life and get educated. You just want to draw attention to yourselves. Here's hoping a piano falls on the Wachowski Bros. before the next two films are made. 1/10. You got a problem with it, too damn bad.",negative,1,tt0133093
"Brad Pitt and especially Morgan Freeman were wonderful in this film. The plot was intriguing and the background score was also good. But after seeing quite a number of films with shocking endings I have to say I saw it coming. But still its a great film. Considering it was made in 1995, David Fincher did a tremendous job in making a visually stunning film. Kevin Spacey who plays the diabolical yet misunderstood serial killer was awesome in every way you can imagine. Definitely one of the best murder-mystery drama out there. Inspired by the seven deadly sins, the film follows two Cops, one on the verge of retirement and the other newly transfered as they try to solve the mystery behind the serial killing of various unrelated people. If you like crime drama, this film is a MUST WATCH. 8.3/10",negative,3,tt0114369
"Not the worst, not the best. Certainly not a 1. Disney pretty much made all their money back with their first Star Wars film. This continuous protest is not going to make them sell : it's all profits now.
Fans who claim the prequels were better than this new crop of Disney outings are not real fans at all. 
Real fans do not acknowledge the presence of the prequels, they were that bad, and proved that George had really lost his way ( warning signs were in ROTJ ).
We asked for more Star Wars. We got it with Force Awakens, A New Hope clone. The last jedi is continuing the story, and the final instalment will conclude it. The spinoffs are enjoyable enough. Rogue one was an unexpected surprise. Solo is a little above average, certainly not 1/10. 
Wake up people. All those years of asking for more Star Wars, and now every offering becomes an anti-corporate protest. 
Some people have notoriously short term memories.

"I just wanted to say, I am a huge film freak. I have a great deal of respect for some of the greatest films of our time. I love films that have great twist and wonderful acting. But I am human and I have to love films like this. I might love higher quality films. But I do love big action films and rediculous plots. But the difference is I don't go into a movie like this looking for it to be a classic. I expect stupid dialoque, bad acting, and so on. And that is what I got. AND I LOVED IT. That is the main problem with the major movie critics. They don't see it as a fun, stupid film. I do. One actor that has had my eye for about a year now is Vin Diesel. He has yet to be bad in anything I've seen him in. Plus, as soon as I saw ""Pitch Black"", I new he was not only the biggest bad ass in movies in the past decade. But he really can act. And I respect him for that. I can't say the same for Paul Walker. He has always sucked. But I wish that Michelle Rodriquez wasn't in this movie. She just seemed like she was a new version of her ""Girlfight"" character. Her main point in the movie was to look cool and make an angry face at the guys. But I did like Jordana Brewster. I think, with the right material, she could be a great actor. For anyone who saw ""Point Break"", this film is basically the same plot. Just change surfing into street racing and there you go. But I must say. I like this film a lot more than I liked ""Point Break"". Mainly because I have a personal grudge against Keanu Reeves (minus ""The Matrix""). And, Paul Walker may suck, but he's better than freakin' Keanu Reeves. The action sequences in the film are all top notch. The first heist scene is very cool. And the last one in the desert was my favorite. Of all the car films lately (""Driven"", ""Gone in 60 Seconds""), this one is definatly the best of them all. I will no doubt go see it again. And I'll buy the DVD when it comes out. 8.5/10",neutral,5,tt0232500

To tell you the truth, if I could rate it a 0/10 on here I would, it's that bad. The movie essentially centers around Dennis Quaid's character trying to get his movie purchased from a studio, by any means necessary. Well this ""movie"" is less of a movie and more of a bunch of skits, horrible skits, that feature endless stupidity and minimal, if any, laughter. Honestly, I feel like they should've paid me to watch this movie and I watched it for free. I truly feel sorry for anyone who watched this in theaters.

"I did not expect much, but I did like season 1...after that it is becoming more and more anoying. First off all we see the same bad guys times and times again. Ultron is returning every few episodes. And then there is the script. There is no good storry or fights. Every episode Avengers start as weak, they cant fight even against midle level oponent...and close to the end of episode...ooooo look they can fight. The same story all over again. Example: Captain Marvel gets owned by Crimson Widow ( black widow). And not by some tech. Crimson Widow ( mortal women) punches Captain Marvel and drops her on the ground. O cmon!! Captain marvel can punch through large alien ship and she is not hurt...but punch from human takes her out? It is pike Hawkeye would punch Hulk and drop him on the floor.

"What an excellent movie. I actually saw this twice in the same day and that was because I went to take someone else to see it after I already saw it. Now this had all the signs of a good movie--excellent director, magnificent casting, very good actors, and the anticipation of a plot. And this movie had its plot--something many of this year's movies were lacking. This Batman outdoes all the other Batmans made and Bale does such a good job that he finally cleared Keaton of the ""Batman"" name. I did not think Bale could pull it off, but I was proved wrong. Everyone else was good for their parts and I must give my credits to my favorite DC villain--the Scarecrow. Murphy couldn't have done better. From the moment we see him, we know he's crazy as he should be. This movie had just about everything--enough action (not overly done where one gets tired of it), enough dialogue (not the type that makes a movie drag), good cinematography and scenery, and much more. You thirst for more when it ends. If you appreciate good movies with a real story and not just mindless action, you must see this one. Now I usually say the goods and bads of a movie. I suppose the downsides would be: not more screening time for the Scarecrow or Watanabe (who is an excellent actor), Holmes' acting, and the fact that I'm going to have to wait a while to buy this on DVD. Everything else is true. The statement that there are too many Batman movies must be dismissed--this it the REAL Batman movie. If you are a true fan, see this now. This is definitely up there with Spider-man. Don't let the trailers fool you if you didn't find them appealing.

The flavor-of-the-week soundtrack is a mix of all the teenager cool hip-hop and cool new-metal hits. It's loud and constant. It's sometimes hard to hear the actors deliver their cool one-liners. The entire thing looks like a cross between a car ad and a sexy MTV mega-hits video. I guess I'm just not cool enough. 3/10.",negative,3,tt0232500
"What keeps this movie from being a total disaster is the short segments within it. If this was one movie with one storyline, one plot, etc., it would be one of the worst movies ever made. The main ""plot"" (if one can even call it that) is so brainless and stupid I almost quit watching. But I'm glad I hung in there for the first few minutes, which were terrible. Things picked up from there, with some monstrous laughs. Each short segment has absolutely nothing to do with the next, and that's what makes it work. Now, that being said, a couple of the segments are stupid, unfunny, gross, and boring. But most of them are a hoot. Talk about random, silly, impossible, hilarious situations. What I will never understand is why people go into a movie like this expecting perfection. This movie does not try in the least bit to be intelligent. It just tries to be funny and entertaining, and for the most part, it succeeds. (With a few exceptions.) Another thing I enjoyed was the use of many talented cast members. It's fun to see these people in a movie that isn't to be taken seriously. I'm sure they filmed their parts in less than a day, and got a laugh out of it. A lot of reviews will tell you it was a waste of talent. In my opinion, everyone needs to goof off and do something silly once in a while. I know my review cites mostly good things about this movie, but my 5/10 star rating is with good reason. While there are many gut-busting hilarious parts to it, the bad parts are so bad, they offset much of the good, and somewhat ruin what could have been an 8 star movie. While Movie 43 will not even come close to winning an Oscar, it deserves more credit than most people give it.",neutral,5,tt1333125

"As one might expect from a straight to video sequel of the less than subpar horror franchise, Leprechaun 3 is a dreadfully unfunny and annoying horror comedy with its biggest scares being its horrible acting. Putting aside the fact that they have changed the Leprechauns rules for literally every single film up to this point, the screenplay is an absolute mess, stretching on for as long as possible to make a 90 minute runtime, and feeling far longer by the time it's actually finished. It's nothing you haven't seen before from these type of films, and it's so juvenile it often feels like it was written by a horror obsessed 4th grader. The special effects are garbage, the characters are incredibly thin, and it has so many stereotypes and cliches you'll wonder if there is even a bit of originality to find within this films clutches. If you really turn your brain off and just sit back and watch it, you may find a few moments entertaining here and there, but for the most part, Leprechaun 3 is an absolute dud and the worst film in the franchise i've watched so far, although i'm sure there is worse to come.

"It takes its own sweet time setting up the intricate (absurd) plot and detailing much of the back story, spending an awful lot of time explaining itself as people go on and on reciting the rules and logic and pitfalls of dream invasion. I often found myself murmuring ""Yes, yes, I get it."" So many words - so many ideas - unnecessarily spoken. But this slightly overlong odyssey is charged with scenes of superior creativity. Sprawling between the static, verbose moments are genuinely spectacular episodes of stunning hyper-surreal imagination. The grand visual effects are so fluid and organic. The real world is entirely subsumed in this fantastical universe of spellbinding vistas and jaw dropping action, all marvelously animated by some deeply disorienting physics. I was often impatient with the movie, cursing the intermittent scenes of tedious exposition, but what stays with me, however, hauntingly, is a genuine sense of awe. I feel like I've been through a harrowing experience, much more challenging and treacherous than the all the media hype had prepared me for. I had watched its TV commercials convinced that it would be relying entirely on computer generated effects for all its allure. But it turns out the clever concepts that drive the action are captivating as well. I've spent quite a few idle moments reflecting on the perplexing notion of multiple layered dreams, pondering the interplay of the relative time-space of each layer. The old tired cliché of a dream within a dream is here entirely deconstructed and exploded into a bewildering symphony of synchronized chaos. Chaos is an ingredient, for sure, and for so many viewers, the defining one. They have found the story to be too randomly illogical and ponderously convoluted. What's so funny about this reaction is that it's possible ONLY if you expected this farcical tale to to be anything else but purely ridiculous. For me the only way to receive the crass, dreary product that Hollywood regularly excretes on us is to accept it ironically, sarcastically. It's just as much fun to not only laugh along with the somewhat humorous shenanigans, but to also laugh AT the contrived crap - a full throated, hearty roar of mocking contempt. I take my yucks wherever I can get 'em. So, armed with this snide attitude, a movie just isn't able to ""let me down."" I always find something to enjoy, even if it means taking pleasure in despising it. Got that? Good. I didn't expect Inception to change my world, or even worse, to support my pitifully puny version of life's meaning. That seems to be most people's expectation of movies, to have their own major and minor delusions validated. Go figure... Leonardo is riveting, as always, and does his utmost best with the often cumbersome script. As tortuously explicit as the dialog gets, Leo manages to sustain a convincing and compelling character. Ellen Page strikes a nice balance of innocent wonder and precocious arrogance. She reminds me a lot of Jeneane Garofalo, but cuter and not as smug. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has the look and composure of a classic Hollywood star, but the talent of a veteran character actor; a real pleasure to watch him work. And there are a few heavyweights filling out the cast including a barely recognizable, substantial Tom Berenger, and also the usually sublime Ken Watanabe, who is partially wasted here in a minimal role. Michael Caine's elegant appearances bookend the film, anchoring the whole fanciful, capricious event. His regal presence lends gravitas to any production. As obtuse and self satisfied as Inception is I have found that there are few films that have taken such complete advantage of the film medium. I can only think of three or four other movies that have stunned me more. One of them, of course, is Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A space Odyssey from 1968, and another is David Lynch's Inland Empire from 2006, which has taken the art of cinema to an unprecedented level, employing absolutely no computer generated effects but achieving what is, for me, one of the most intense, profound, mind and soul shattering cinematic experience of my life. It's indescribably remarkable. The Matrix, in case you're wondering, is not one of the others. HA! That steaming heap of ox dung is remarkable only for its mind numbing stupidity.

"""You know who I am."" The Departed follows Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon), as they get sucked into the dirty affairs of the Irish mafia and the Boston police department, chasing each other's tail as both of them are double agents for opposite sides. The film is a Martin Scorsese adaptation to a Hong Kong movie named Infernal Affairs. Let's start with some stuff that bothered me, this time. This is quite a long film - about two and a half hours - so its relatively fast pacing works quite well. However, I would argue that the progress in this film is rather weird. Things are supposed to get more tense as the film goes on, both emotionally and plot-wise, but I feel like the movie hasn't quite managed to succeed in that. Also, for such a lengthy film I'd expect some deeper meaning, which I'm yet to fully comprehend. Yeah, sure, it's about toxic masculinity, futile struggles, the importance of having an identity, violence breeds violence, all of that. But it doesn't feel WHOLE, you get me? It's there but it doesn't click all the way, and not all throughout the film. So it kinda works but not as much as I'd like it to be. I do like the casting choices, of course. DiCaprio, Damon and Jack Nicholson (as Costello) are all great, Vera Farmiga is definitely solid as Madolyn as well. Mark Wahlberg doesn't get a whole lot of screen time but he's fun, yeah. The themes that I mentioned earlier though work well together with the overall narrative, so though I'd like them to be more developed they're there and some of them, especially the toxic masculinity and the identity things, are communicated quite well in the movie. I'd also argue that this film's memorability is...for a lack of a better word, peculiar. Strange. The movie doesn't feel special at all in so many ways - it isn't directed in a mind-blowing well (just a decent one), the soundtrack is pretty good, great cast, all of that. But though the premise of the movie sounds good, and by most means it's a good movie (it is), and I do enjoy it overall - the plot is engaging enough and I do care for Billy's character - I still wonder how much of it all is worth the praise it gets. How much is truly special here. I don't think that there's much to it, but I do deem it worth watching. To sum it up: though The Departed is definitely not the film to make me fall in love with Scorsese's art, it's a solid film overall. Great cast, interesting themes and cool motifs are all there. It's a bit too lengthy maybe for the payoff to certain people, but I definitely enjoy the mind games, the questions about identity and the plot itself. I'm feeling a 7.2/10 on this one.",negative,2,tt0407887
"I went into this film with a fresh mind, having not heard much about it or any spoilerish stuff. Other than the unfortunate passing away of Heath, everything else was neutral with me. Wow did this movie try too too hard. It was like it was auditioning itself to become part of the rotation on the Bravo or AMC channel. There were just way too many unnecessary story lines involved here, all trying to make things more complex than they really were, all with that constant gloomy depressed feeling too, both staples of ""serious"" films. Don't get me wrong, it started off with a nice bang with the Joker, but soon after that Harvey Dent and his whole campaign issues became involved, then that whole storyline of the guy trying to frame Bruce Wayne came up, and then that whole byline about the commissioner's secret operation, and then the whole kidnapping of the Oriental mobster came up, and then the three-way romance between Bruce, Harvey, and Rachel came up, and so on and so forth. And that's not even including all the other segments involving Joker meeting up all the mobsters and following up on his big plan. You see what I mean, it was just trying to hard in too many areas all at once. Iron Man did it quite nicely by not taking itself too seriously. Yes there were fantastical parts in that film, but it never wavered too long on one issue or tried to have too many issues plague the script all at once. And that brings up another point about the dark knight. Was I only one a little offended at how the script just wanted us to so easily accept the Joker and his small crew doing so much with so little. I mean I just kept thinking that there's too many variables that have to be ignored in order for this to happen, but the movie sure makes it seem like everything should be instantly taken as fact. Problem with all the powerful mob bosses and their hundreds of men? Don't worry, Joker took care of that with his one little meeting with them. - Problem with trying to kill Harvey Dent, who's being escorted by nearly the entire Gotham City Police force? Don't worry, Joker and a few henchmen inside a truck can take care of that, all while somehow managing to block off entire sections of the city streets too. - Problem with trying to get out of jail? Don't worry, Joker already planned on having some guy with a live bomb inside of him, and timed everything to the second. - Problem with trying to get all of Gotham onto two ferry boats charged with explosives? Don't worry, Joker must've figured out some way to block off ALL highways and freeways leading in and out of Gotham, not to mention figuring out a way to stop all of the airlines, trains, and the entire US government and it's military power too. All with a just a few henchmen too. Anyways this movie get a 5/10 from out of me.",neutral,5,tt0468569
"I'll start this off by saying I didn't have extremely high expectations for this film. Between the change of directors and all of the chaos the trailer release underwent in February, I knew the movie would have some flaws. I will say ,however, that the movie did exceed my expectations. The movie starts out pretty slow with little direction. The action scenes are exciting but not especially gripping. I almost stopped paying attention, but what kept me going was knowing that this was about Han Solo, and not some random Star Wars character. The second half of the movie is really where the story gets interesting. The characters figure out what they have to do and the plot becomes clear. One of the best scenes was during the Kessel Run when Han flies the falcon alone for the first time. It's very refreshing to see Han flying the ship with excitement, rather than the tired indifference that takes over in a New Hope. Like I said; the second half is much better, but the last 40 minutes is what makes the movie worth watching. It felt like an Oceans 11 movie with all the twists, few of which I saw coming. The filmmaking is phenomenal here and it really saves the movie. Without the last 40 minutes, the movie deserves a 4/10. If you have time, go see this movie. It's exciting and fairly well made. If you don't have time, don't worry. You aren't missing out on too much.",negative,4,tt3778644

I wouldn't go as far to say that this is one of the best movies ever. But the acting is very good and the story is f----- up as hell. That's all I give the film. That's pretty much it. I would recommend this for Ed fans or Brad as well. I expected a lot and only got about 89% of the film's satisfaction. That's all I have to say about that. 9/10",positive,9,tt0137523
"Lots of people love Fight Club for the plot twist. Others praise the acting or the dialogue. These three things combine to form a blockbuster movie. It's edgy, intense, it leaves you on the edge of your seat. Or, to sink lower, it's a triumph, and I give it two thumbs up. That's not what makes the movie good. Fight Club is good because: A. It calls into question modern men and their relationship to women, commercialism, friendship, individualism, identity, sanity, self-image, addiction, and a few billion other things and boils them all down to order and chaos. It doesn't get preachy, either. B. It has deep, interesting characters. C. It has really good small stuff. Preachiness gets old fast, as movies like American History X (another Edward Norton movie) and Signs attest. Fight Club avoids getting preachy by vilifying the preacher (Tyler Durden) and providing lots of different answers to its questions. The characters are beautifully disgusting. There's Marla, the suicidal sex-fiend, Bob, the steroid-filled man who perfected the art of chest expansion, Tyler, the controlling grungy idol, and many characters with no name but you love them anyway. But what makes Fight Club shine the most is the small stuff. The music and visuals are synced up with the dialogue perfectly. There's a scene in Edward Norton's condo that has furniture appearing left and right as it's mentioned by Norton. Or in the Reader's Digest scene, Tyler Durden rides a bicycle around in a wet basement without pants on. It's subtle and it works. Even the cheesy Hollywood plot twist towards the end has a subtle meaning, relating back to the premise of a struggle against commercialism. If you haven't seen this movie, see it. If you have, see it again, and pay attention to the little stuff. It's worth it. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0137523
"It was just over 50 years ago now that George Lucas captured magic in ""Star Wars"", retroactively titled ""Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope"" after it became clear his vision garnered the demand for many more films. There are few occasions when a film is able to transport you to a different time and place (in this case a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away), but ""Star Wars"" makes you completely forget you're watching a movie. Part of that is because Lucas was able to masterfully blend inspirations from J. R. R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"", Akira Kurosawa's samurai classic ""The Hidden Fortress"", Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and even ""Wizard of Oz"" into his lore and mythology. This movie is also a true genre-bender. When we follow Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) it's a coming-of-age story; a roughneck space pirate Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his furry companion Chewbacca provide buddy comedy elements, and at the heart of the movie there's a rescue plot for the ""damsel-in distress"" Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), who turns that trope on it's head. All of this is wrapped up in a fantasy space opera, and it somehow works. George Lucas managed to blend all of these elements to perfection and captivate and transport audiences to a different time and place with iconic characters that have stood the test of time. I won't harp on the plot points too much but the journey that this movie takes us on through the eyes of Luke, a naive moisture farmer who's never left his home planet of Tattooine, is one of the film's strong points. Luke is instantly relatable to us as we explore the galaxy for the first time with him. Of course the special effects were so incredibly ahead of its time, it's mind-boggling this movie came out in 1977. Less than a decade prior, Stanley Kubrick directed ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", a film known for its it's amazing special effects depicting space. What it isn't known for however is aliens, something Kubrick said was impossible to visualize on the big screen. ""Star Wars"" populates it's planets with fascinating alien species and living creatures that allow us to get lost in this vast world Lucas is building. These excellent special effects culminate in an exciting final battle on the Death Star between Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness) and Darth Vader, but like I said the journey and the characters are what make this film. The intrigue and interest George Lucas was able to create with the Force, lightsabers, Jedis, and the overarching galactic conflict had viewers of ""Star Wars"" instantly hooked, and this film went on to spawn one of the greatest film and media franchises of all time. That's a testament to it's greatness. 9.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0076759
"-Interstellar is the next big film from Christopher Nolan. Future Earth is running out of food and Matthew McConaughey must lead an exploration into a black hole in space to another galaxy to save humanity. (I will not be able to say much about the film's plot without spoiling anything.) Before I saw it, I thought it could be the next 2001: A Space Odyssey. I will say whether I was right or not at the end.... -So Interstellar is hard to judge, but I loved a lot of it. It had its flaws, but I loved a lot more than I disliked. So yeah. -The story was pretty good, original, and solid. It had some twists and some great moments in it! It also had a few things that didn't make sense of come around to resolution at the end. -The pace was okay. It had some pretty slow moments for a 3 hour film. Also it was 3 hours and could have been a little shorter. -The tone was great. It explored themes of humanity, space, time, love, and a lot of relativity. It also had some kinda essential themes where were eh. -The acting was good. McConaughey did a great job and this it my new favorite role for him! However, if you don't like the actor, you won't like him in this. Anne Hathaway did great! Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck, Michael Caine, and John Lithgow all did a great job! However, I HATE Topher Grace because he reminds me of Spider-Man 3 and his lack of acting sills. -The effects were mind-blowing. Kinda like 2001.... Should they beat Apes for best effects? Idk. Gravity just won, so probably not. However, there are some visually stunning effects that make it soooooo worth it! -The music was fantastic!! Hans Zimmer's original score offered so much to the film and it would have been a different ride without him. I hope he wins an Oscar for it. No joke. -There were a few editing choices I wasn't fond of. But then came to appreciate. And a few moments where I thought ""You'd better explain this"" and then they did. Nolan covered more based in this than The Dark Knight Rises. -One thing I hated but can't hold against the film was the aspect ratio. It went from regular to IMAX to regular a lot and I noticed. It was inevitable though. No hard feelings -Content: It is PG-13 for some intense sequences and some language. -I think that's it.... So Interstellar has its flaws, but it's still fantastic! I walked out very satisfied with a lot to think about! I will say Interstellar is EASILY worth seeing in theaters! Or 3D. Or IMAX. Twice. I really need to see it again to just anything more. I don't know where is falls in my Top 100 or Top 10 for the year yet. I will post that when I decide. So for now, I am going to give Interstellar a VERY high 8.5/10 to be safe. -Was it 2001: A Space Odyssey? It was not as good, no. However, I will say it is as good as we are going to get. Both are visually stunning and explore deep themes of humanity and space/time while offering captivating sequences!",neutral,5,tt0816692
"Seabiscuit is a film that will find a lot of appraisal from critics and audiences, and for good reason:  It was bred for that exact purpose.  It's the kind of film that is a by-the-books ""How to Win An Oscar"" film.  There isn't necessarily anything wrong with that, but it leaves the door open for a lot of problems to come.  And quite a few slip through in Seabiscuit.  The screenplay dances between being melodramatic and corny to thoughtful and well-written.  It's the kind of story that says ""Okay, be inspired....Now"". It tries to force the hope and inspiration aspect on the audience instead of letting it flow naturally.  This results in a few too many hokey scenes. And I know this is based on real events, but all the characters and their trials and tribulations are presented in a very drab and generic manner. There wasn't a real great character in the story. Gary Ross is a good director.  There is some very good cinematography in the movie.  Okay, at times Ross pulls out the old slow motion during the races, but it's forgivable.  Ross is obviously a better director than he is a writer. The film's strongest factor, and the only reason it was as good as it was, was the excellent cast.  True, they don't have too much to go with, but each does an exceptional job.  I'm not the world's biggest Tobey Maguire fan, but I was really impressed with his performance.  Cooper seems to be walking through his role, but an actor of the caliber Chris Cooper is can do that and make it look great.  Jeff Bridges is provided with the most challenges emotionally, but he graces through them all with the performance of a true craftsman.   The real story, and single best element of the movie, is William H. Macy's vaudeville sports caster.  H. Macy fits the role to a T, and brings to a life a truly fun character.  A scene stealer, indeed. The movie features very good cinematography, and a phenomenal cast.  The presentation of the film is just too melodramatic for my tastes. 6/10 * * 1/2/ * * * *",neutral,6,tt0329575
"Let me start off by saying I liked the film. That's right, I liked it. In my opinion, ""like"" is a long way from ""love"", and ""love"" this film, is something I did not. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of Nolan, and I DID love Batman Begins, I just didn't think this film was worth all the hype, it's a great sequel, but that's all it is.. A sequel. Most people seem think this film is something huge, something amazing, something that outshines all Batman films to date, I can honestly say I disagree. This film is worth a watch, and worth the money, but I don't feel it's quite the movie of the decade, the year, or even the summer. PLOT One GREAT thing about this film, is it's plot. As with all the Batman films, it has a rich heritage and the director has put his own swing on the tale. The plot itself is equal to, if not slightly better than that of the '89 Burton adaptation of the Joker's story. CINEMATOGRAPHY Call me a fool, but it didn't live up to Batman Begins, some of the shots were badly placed and the cuts were just too damn short, leaving the tense-o-meter a step too high for what is always just going to be a comic book story at heart. DIALOUGE They were trying too damn hard for ""quoteability factor"", and not nearly hard enough on character building. This is a Batman film! People aren't looking to reference the damn thing in their next presidential speech! Some of the dialogue was REALLY forced, and very cringe-worthy for much of the film. The sequence at the end was the only part that was truly great, Gordon's final ""Dark Knight"" speech to his son, that's where the great quote really work well, not mid-sentence during a meeting between two criminal leaders in a warehouse.. It doesn't really work. MISE EN SCENE Not much to say here, clue's in the title. Unless your screen is well back lit, prepare for squint-city. SOUND The sounds in this movie were great, as was the score. A couple of pieces were too casual when they could have easily been given more shock factor with the aide of the score, the famous ""pencil"" trick, and the few coin-flips. Instead they seemed to resort to using fast-cuts in the wrong places, which are never as effective as a good strings section. EFFECTS One thing they didn't hold back on. Some great special effects in this film, but some naive audiences seem to forget it's the AFFECT of the movie, not the EFFECTS. EMOTIONAL VALUE It didn't quite hit me in the heart the way Begins did, it seemed to try and be an emotion-run film, but it really didn't work for me.. It's hard to describe, I felt something, but I was very ""aware"" this was an action film. Even the deaths and drama, still didn't match up to the feeling Batman Begins gave off, at no point in this movie did I feel over-run with any kind of emotion, besides the initial weird-ness of seeing a dead man on screen in the film that killed him, but you can get that from Enter The Dragon, or The Crow - it's nothing new and exciting. Final Verdict : The Dark Knight, whilst being a slightly-higher-than mediocre Action flick, really does not live up to it's predecessor, and certainly does not deserve it's current ""#1"" slot, on the IMDb top 250. I'd say if the third is just as good, it'll make a decent set, but it's not a great film in it's own right, in the way Batman Begins was. 6.5/10",neutral,5,tt0468569

I think this film was very underrated. With the score it got (4.4/10) I don't think it deserved that low. People just need to give a movie a chance, not just crush every movie.

"The plot and the sub plots are good but not great, which sums up most of the movie. Many of the characters are very one-dimensional, such as the Guard Captain, whose only characteristic is that he takes any chance he gets to abuse prisoners. The acting in the film is nothing special except for Bill Bolender who does a fantastic job in the few seconds he gets to play Elmo Blatch. What bothered me a lot and what makes the film noticeably worse than it could've been is Morgan Freeman's narration that spoon feeds the viewer with information that should've been communicated with the shots shown during the narration. Without the narration, the viewers would have been forced to focus on the actions, facial expressions and body language of the different characters to understand what they are going through. There is a reason to why Harrison Ford's narration in the original version of Blade Runner is excluded in the two later versions. There are many theories surrounding the ending of the movie, but in my opinion these theories only exist because the ending is so boring that people create better endings in their minds to make the disappointing movie they've just seen better.

"Ridley Scott is a trustworthy director, and even though a couple of his movies (Hannibal, Black Hawk Down) aren't as great as his older ones (Alien, Blade Runner) he still manages to at least direct them good. Here, he takes the more Hollywood type of approach and uses camera style previously used in the 1998 feature Saving Private Ryan. What Ridley Scott understands is that to see the action, one must be in the action. He uses his this technique in Black Hawk Down with his rapid- fire photography of the battle scenes. In Blade Runner, the camera was constantly focused near Deckard. He carefully chooses his shots here and instead of just saying ""Okay, let's make it realistic"" he choses to be more detailed and shows beauty in the scenes. He should have won Best Director instead of Steven Sodernbergh. Unfortunately, John Logan and co's script ends up being mediocore at best. They are trying to dazzle the audience with a magnificent feast of old proverbs and tight dialouge, but it ends up being the typical cliche type of dialouge. Maximus is the hero, yes, but the writers smolder it in our faces showing how he can just take anyone on and still hold out well. The performances are first- rate, and even though Russell Crowe's performance was powerful it was not as good as his ""The Insider"" of which he truly should have won for. Did he deserve at least a nomination? Yes he did. In support is the always energetic and young Joaquien Phoneix as the deceptive and brutal son of the Emperor, who always seems to have a few tricks up his sleeve. His performances blends craftiness and muscular strength in a beautiful tense and even if his character is a bit cliche it's not noticeable. He should have beat out Benicio Del Toro. Also in the backround is Richard Harris as the wise and friendly Emperor Commodus who wishes for war to end. His performance masterfully builds off himself and his character, and he at least deserved to be nominated for Best Supporting Actor. As Commodus's daughter, Connie Nielsen provides most of the emotional work but she's harldy in the movie. There are some masterful shots here of the towering (CGI) arenas and the interesting costume designs to build upon everything. Even if the script isn't too good, the rest of the movie adds up enough to be a somewhat enjoyable experience and still one of the best movies of 2000. 8.5/10",neutral,5,tt0172495

Critics gave it five stars and in spite of being relatively unknown in the popular cinema world everyone who mattered looked up and noticed. Much more than the movie which was remade in several languages a new director cum writer came on the fore front. Christopher Nolan.A decade has passed and he has given us a number of critically acclaimed movies which also bloomed at the box office, breathed life into the Batman franchise which was dead and buried after Batman and Robin. Now he has come one up with another masterpiece, Inception. Without giving much away, Leonardo plays a thief who is quite adept at stealing secrets from the human mind.He has to come up with one final job to be able to return back home.And so onwards the action unfolds.Its so refreshing to see that Leo after becoming famous via that, ooohh soo cute role in Titanic has not lost his way as an actor.The process started from The Gangs of New York and he continues to excel.Ellen Page does a competent job with Ken Watanbe coming up with some great one- liners.Micheal Caine also gets the obligatory role as he does in every Nolan movie. With Nolan at the helm, a incredible but plausible story, some great acting and an intriguing climax which will not let you even blink, Inception is brilliant movie making at its best.All the elements in the movie suit it to a T.

"This movie having an average rating of 8.5 at the moment is to me just another proof that the rating and review system of this site is completely out of order... Pixar used to be all about telling great stories with a lot of playful creativity and originality thrown into the mix. But what Coco is just yet another sad example of is that they've found their ""successful"" formula as well as they've settled into a certain safe way of doing everything. This is the same story we've seen a million times before: A kid has a dream for his future but is prevented to follow that dream because of the surroundings he lives in (in this case his family), and of course he goes on a journey that changes everything and he can eventually live this dream. This is basically A Bugs Life (and a million other similar stories) in a Mexican setting but without anything new and original added. The main plot twists where so super obvious that you spent half the film waiting for them to be revealed... Also all the structure around the story - the flow of the story, the supporting characters, the way it's animated, the many little slap-stick (supposedly) humorous elements - it all reeks of habits and ""let's just stay in our comfort zone and play it safe""....

"It's a very soft 9, but it's a 9/10 for me. Directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Christopher Nolan, Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer - these guys are in their primes here. Not that the same isn't true of some of the actors involved in this film, Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart. It's hard for me to do a review on this film and certainly the character of the late Heath Ledger is one of the greatest villains in cinema history. He is played to perfection. Perfect would even be putting it mildly. Ledger is so great in this film that all the awards and recognition he has received from around the world are too little. Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Gary Oldman are all super, but the one who shines brightest out of the entire cast with the exception of Ledger is Aaron Eckhart and his character, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Christopher Nolan's hidden ace. A perfect addition to the film's story. The action scenes are OK, the sound is good, the film is generally very good technically and is far from the most successful in the genre, but the acting, the pacing and the story itself make The Dark Knight (2008) the giant that it is. I recommend it along with the other two installments in the series, ""Batman Begins"" (2005), and the not-so-good ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012). Final score: 9/10.",positive,9,tt0468569

"Dear George, I remember seeing Star Wars on its first release and being completely immersed in the story, the characters, the effects - to a thirteen year old it was wonderful, I saw it a couple of times after and the magic never diminished. BUT THEN at the weekend I sat down and saw this ""new"" film with added effects that more often than not stuck out like a sore thumb. Additions that somehow said ""remember that film you loved so much...well actually it wasn't good enough"". Well Mr Lucas it WAS good enough, it didn't need some hokey special effects to make it better - for me it had the opposite effect. In particular the scene with Han and Jabba looked dreadful - it repeated (almost verbatim) a previous scene, made Jabba seem insignificant and unthreatening and made poor Harrison Ford look like a second-rate actor who didn't know where to look. Sure I still enjoyed the film - but the additions (and of course the inevitable subtractions) meant that there was no longer any magic here for me. Just because you can do this it doesn't mean you should. You had the opportunity to show off all your special effects muscle in The Phantom Menace, why did you feel the need to meddle with your ""back-catalogue"" to try and produce a homogenous mass of work rather than a timeline through recent film history. Your attempts failed and now you have a half-decent film where there was once a great one. Thanks also for giving a treasured childhood memory a thorough kicking. -Andy (6/10)",neutral,6,tt0076759

Well, everything from the story, the performances, the cinematography, the music, the direction  with no one thing overbearing another, just a perfect balance  how the hell did Christopher Nolan do it? Give the guy an Oscar, and while you're there make sure Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart and Christian Bale are all nominated. The film settles down about half-way through or so and lets you take a breath but that only works to the film's benefit as it starts to build the tension again and heads for an ending that leaves you wanting more. The Joker was the perfect psychotic mysterious villain  R.I.P. Heath, who with this performance and his performance in Brokeback Mountain has convinced me that he was one of the outstanding talents of his generation and I wouldn't have been surprised if he had gone on to win multiple Oscars  it sounds like I'm just eulogising because he's gone, but I genuinely believe he had the ability to become the character in such a way that all you saw was the character and not the high-profile actor underneath it  that's difficult to achieve because all actors have quirks they carry with them from one film to the next, he seemed to be a blank palette who could metamorphose himself into whatever he wanted. In my opinion Heath and Daniel Day-Lewis are on a different level to their peers. If LOTR: Return of the King can sweep the Oscars, which it deserved to do, I feel the The Dark Knight should do the same. It's done what no other comic book film I've seen has done before and delivered characters with so much depth to them working evenly together in a story packed with plot and balanced with exciting action sequences. It's funny because I really didn't enjoy Batman Begins when I first watched it. I had in my mind the Batman films I'd seen before and Begins was such a departure, I was really disappointed with the film and also with Christian Bale as Batman, even though he's an actor I really like. After all the hype with The Dark Knight and with the excellent trailers I re-watched Begins and because this time I knew what I was going into I enjoyed the film and Christian Bale's performance more. I changed my rating from 5/10 to 6/10  maybe on further viewing it will go up to 7/10, but that's it. It's a film that deserves a lot of credit for trying something new, but it's flawed. The Dark Knight, on the other hand, is a masterpiece. Chritopher Nolan is a genius, not just for this, but when you include his previous films, I think it's hard to argue that he isn't the greatest director working today. There has to be a third Batman film, sadly it will have to be without the Joker, as any replacement would feel like an imitation of Heath and detract from the film, but despite that, it's still going to be a great film, you just know it. Chritopher Nolan can't do anything average.",neutral,5,tt0468569
"Fight Club is a cult classic that demands your full attention. The twist at the end is so impactful, it almost forces you to rethink everything you've watched up until that point. The iconic line, ""The first rule of Fight Club is, do not talk about Fight Club"" is just a glimpse into the raw energy and rebellion that the film exudes. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt's performances are electric, with each character navigating their personal turmoil in brutal ways. The themes of consumerism, identity, and self-destruction are still incredibly relevant. It's a film that stays with you, forcing you to question the world around you. I rate Fight Club a solid 8/10 for its cultural impact and unforgettable moments.",positive,8,tt0137523
"I loved this movie!!! It succeeded in mushing up the difference between imaginary and truth. The characters have unreal connections and interactions which cause you to go ""huh!?!"" before the movie is over. The fantastical backdrops, out-there characters, and hard-edged music make it impossible to take your eyes off the screen. And I promise, you will be repeating the dialogue for days. Watch this film, you won't be disappointed. I give it a 9/10! Remember, don't become a slave to the Ikea catalogue.",positive,9,tt0137523
"The word 'Epic' seems insufficient to describe the scope of this production; it is truly mind-blowing. I also have to mention the original music by Howard Shore; a truly magical score that I will seek out just to listen to (it's really that good). As far as performances go, well everybody did a great job but those that stood out (for me) were; Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Sean Astin as Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Sean Bean as Boromir. Also worthy of note were; Billy Boyd as Pippin, Dominic Monaghan as Merry, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, Liv Tyler as Arwen, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Christopher Lee as Saruman, Ian Holm as Bilbo and not forgetting Andy Serkis as Gollum (more from him in the next two instalments). This is the second time I have seen this cut of the movie and, although it is very long, I must say I have seldom enjoyed a film as much. I will not try to compare the book with the film; I'm sure there are many out there that could do a far more eloquent job than me. Needless to say, there are differences, and I can see the reasons for them. Just daring to bring such an epic tale to the screen would be enough for many, but to also do it justice is beyond imagining. Hats off to Mr. Jackson and all those involved; you did a tremendous job! I know it's not to everyone's taste and I really feel sorry for those that can't appreciate the imagination and effort that goes into an undertaking like this. All this praise and I only give it a 9.4? Well, let's say I've seen the other two films and I'm leaving a little room for improvement. SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

"In the IMDb top 100, Christopher Nolan is easily one of the most prominent directors you'd find there. When looking at my scratch-off poster, 6 out of the 100 movies are directed by him - more than any other director there, actually. Quite insane. As those who are following me for a while already know, Mr. Nolan and I have a... complicated relationship, let's call it. He directed one of my favorite films, Memento, and some of his films - including the one that I'm reviewing here today - have provided my earlier experiences with more mature cinema. On the other hand, as I got into reviewing stuff here, I've been finding more and more recurring issues with his filmography. So, here I am, coming back to this film after like four years. Inception, considered by many to be Nolan's magnum opus, follows Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a guy who specializes in something called ""extraction"" - getting into someone's dreams in order to get information they're trying to keep secret. But this time, though, Cobb gets an unusual job proposal - Inception, getting into someone's dreams in order to plant an idea in their mind. With Cobb's tragic past and haunted present, and an offer by a powerful figure to make things right for him if he succeeds in his mission, he knows that he has to do it. One last job. If you've already read my review of The Prestige, you know that, in my opinion, Nolan has the same core issues with many of his films, and in each film it shows in different amounts of intensity. Here, I'd say, it's not the worst it's ever been, but still noticeable, substantial. Essentially, I feel like Nolan is addicted to this ""wow"" effect, trying to outsmart the viewer with complicated concepts and clever twists, but while focusing on the form and developing his concepts, he ignores the core of the film - characters, emotion, even a solid plot that feels like a good story and not just a way to communicate a concept, sometimes. That's the gist of it. So yeah, the whole getting-into-dreams thing is a really cool concept, and you can see it right away, from the opening scene. The way that throughout the film, action scenes are influenced a lot by this dream physics thing, and just generally the way that this concept carries the plot, is at least somewhat entertaining, yes. The problem is, as usual, that Nolan gets lost inside it, only trying to outsmart the viewers. Sorry, but with this much exposition, when most of it is spoon-fed to the audience, things get exhausting and mechanical. There are better ways to go about concepts of this kind, buddy. Dreams and their meanings have always been fascinating to me. Look at some of my favorite films: Requiem for a Dream, Eyes Wide Shut, Mulholland Drive. The reason that all of them work so well is because of the fact that they realize how much dreams represent our deepest, most buried emotions and impulses. Nolan tries to address that, but he's doing it so mechanically, mainly because his characters here are flat, without any real psychological depth to explore. Yes, even Cobb is not a very good character in my opinion, when it comes to the depth that could be explored in dreams. The so called ""depth"" that we discover feels alright on the story part, as we try to put the pieces together, but it is quite lacking emotionally, I'd say. With all that being said, I can still call this film entertaining. The main cast is pretty solid (DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levit, mainly, and Cillian Murphy is doing a good job as well), so they manage to carry the simple characters with enough charisma to make it work. The plot has me interested, even if not completely immersed, and I do think that it manages to be just enough to make this film...pretty okay. With some huge, glaring problems, but not that bad to watch, most of the time. One more point I have to devote a paragraph to, because it's just so goddamn annoying: Mal. She's horribly written, both in dialogue and when it comes to the emotional aspect of it, and almost every scene that involves her feels forced, mechanical, overdramatic. I mean, sure, Nolan, you could go for a Femme Fatale character if you really wanted to, but there are better ways to do it than...whatever this is. Inception suffers from a severe lack of emotion, and yeah, it's too mechanical, rigid, stiff to have me immersed. As he often does, Nolan gets lost in exposition, spoon-feeding us his oh-so-clever concept. However, I'd say that with enough charismatic main actors, a plot that's entertaining enough and a concept that's developed in ways that are pretty okay, plot-wise, this movie is not a bad watching experience. Lacking, but not horrid. Feeling a 6.2/10 on this one.",negative,2,tt1375666
"They really nail the look and aesthetic of the time period. Very unsettling and eerie soundtrack. Really tight cinematography. The editing can feel off at times, but it might be intentional to give off the feeling of schizophrenia or disorientation. The setup to the premise is really well done. The acting is so good that it's actually scary at times. Leo's acting has some subtleties that really make you understand why he's one of the best and why he's brilliant. Fantastic film locations, very unique. They do a really good job at creating tension. The war and family flashbacks that Teddy has are a stroke of brilliance. It makes the storytelling that much more interesting and engaging. The sound design is very clever. They use these very subtle noises in the background to create unease and tension. This movie is like a disorienting nightmare at times. A real mind f-. Ward C is so creepy and ominous looking. The twist is pretty insane. This is a brilliantly written and put together movie. One of the craziest psychological thrillers ever. It's a very disturbing and dark look at mentally sick people and the way people deal with trauma. The movie definitely has re-watch potential, but it's just too dark and disturbing for me to want to experience it again. This movie was much darker than what I remember when I watched it for the first time. Brilliant movie though. Raw score: 8.2/10.",negative,2,tt1130884
"The Turning (2020)
2/10🕷👻💩 ""The Turning is the kind of horror film that will either piss you off or confuse the hell out of you, all the while being a pile of garbage that will not sit well with anyone."" Horror has not started off strong in 2020, and The Turning poses as the perfect example. The film seems to overstuff itself with irrelevant nostalgia and a soundtrack that's never 90s enough (hint: Nirvana is never played). The characters are cheaply written, to the point where they become more of an eye sore than actually intriguing (Come on Davis and Wolfhard, you're better than this!). The pacing here seems to almost find a wave, however just as it's about to arrive to a proper conclusion, the derailment suddenly hits the viewer, leaving you frustrated; you can never really tell if this is a ghost story or a goddamn psychological horror, but by the film's end, I swear it was a comedy. . Verdict: The Turning is as bad as they come, and not in the ""so bad it's good"" way, but in the actual bad way that'll make you beg for your time AND money back.",negative,2,tt7510346
"This movie was horrid. I think that's the best place to start. This movie was the biggest disappointment I have ever had. The worst part was that for the first hour I actually thought they were going to follow the book. Then the pain began. By adding and changing scenes from the book, they completely ruined a good movie. Some people argue that if the movie exactly matched the book, people should just read the book. I argue that if they want to make up there own story don't try to remake a book by someone else. The things added to this movie were not put there to improve the story anyway. They just added a level of badly acted drama that the film did not need. Why they felt the need to change the story to emphasize the plight of Frodo and Middle-earth with bad drama I will never know. The whole movie is already bent on these ideas, so why they felt like shoving it down our throats is a mystery. Maybe they want to try for Oscars... I've got an idea let's do another close up of Merry's face full of determination... Another problem is the fighting scenes. These were insulting. There is a difference between unrealistic fantasy fighting, like in the first film, and in your face crap that wouldn't even be shown on MST3K. If you can just run over 10,000 orcs with 5 horses and be fine, why didn't they just do that in the beginning?  Obviously, the orcs have no momentum and no ability to even hold a spear up against a horse... I could go on about the problems of this movie for much longer but instead I'll just say this. If you have invested any time at all into this series, do not watch this movie, because it is horrible and will only irritate you. 1/10",negative,1,tt0167261
"First off, I'd like to make a statement: I have not read any of the LOTR books by Tolkien. I once started out in The Hobbit, but didn't think much of it. So I'd like to review the Movie, and will not relate it to the book. So I don't care if Middle Earth 'came to life' to some viewers, or if the Orks really had 3 eyes or whatever. I don't care about that. Let's start with a view at the story. A ring that has the power to destroy the world falls into the hands of young Frodo (Wood), who with help of several friends has to destroy it on a special place. The first movie of the trilogy basically are these people on their journey to that place. And that's it. I don't care where that place is, which member of the Fellowship really is the son of whom, what is going to happen in the next movies or whatever. This is the open ended story presented, and it's really not that interesting. Way too many (unimportant) characters are involved, the movie is lacking in story and pace and isn't as epic as a lot of people (mostly fans of the book), make you believe it is. If you analyze it, the movie goes like this: Group of people taking a journey. Have a fight. Lose a guy. Continue journey. Have a fight. Lose a guy. Continue journey, etcetera, etcetera. These fights might be against different enemies (Orks, Uru-kai, a huge monster or black knights), it all comes down to the same thing. And that, to be honest, is a bit boring. The worst part though is that when Lotr:Fotr finally does finish, nothing has really happened. They're still on their journey, still losing guys and I'm sure they're gonna have a lot more fights in the other 2 films, of which I already saw The Two Towers. Is it really necessary to expand an easy (mind you, I didn't say bad) story to a 9 hour movie extravaganza? For instance, is Cate Blanchetts character really of importance to the movie? No, the only reason she's in there because she's in the book. And that's a pretty lame reason, since this is Film-making we're talking about. Now, it's not that the Fellowship is a really bad movie. It all looks phenomenal and we have to congratulate Peter Jackson for the fact he got those studio people mad (or, in retrospect, wise) enough to spend so much money on it. We have to respect Tolkien for creating an exciting world, full of imaginative details. But, for the many things Fellowship is (a cool look at the book for fans?), a good movie it most definitely is not. 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0120737
"Christopher Nolan is one of the most appreciated, well-known and successful directors of our time, period. In the IMDb top 100 there are, like, 6 movies made by him, which is insane. ANY artist getting to have 6 entries in a top 100 list of their medium is crazy. It's more than any other director, which means that he is the director with the highest amount of masterpieces, according to IMDb. He gets love everywhere, to the point where I'm talking about him quite a lot, simply because discussions with many film lovers often turn to Nolan's work. It's everywhere. Every Nolan movie that comes out is a huge event, which you can't say on many directors these days, too. I also feel like by this point I understand Nolan pretty well, having watched most of his filmography, reviewing several of his most loved and critically acclaimed movies. The thing is, my relationship with this guy is rather complicated - most of his film I've watched and reviewed are ones I'm having quite a lot of issues with. Memento is the only exception so far, actually. So yeah, I don't know how excited I am to review a Nolan trilogy, but it needs to be done, I guess. These movies are very loved, widely acclaimed, have a huge cultural impact, and two of these movies are also necessary to finish the IMDb top 100. So yeah. Diving into it, with now a few weeks of this trilogy ahead of us. Batman Begins (2005) is the first movie in The Dark Knight Trilogy. It revolves around the origins of Batman, so even though I know many of you are familiar with the story already, considering how iconic this character is, I'll give a quick summary for those of you who are yet to dive into this story. We follow the caped crusader here from the very conception of this alter-ego: Bruce Wayne, son to the rich Wayne family, witnesses the murder of both of his parents in a dark alley robbery that went horribly wrong. Traumatized, lost and scared, he grows up, and the movie follows the path the man who used to be this boy takes, as he transforms from this scared, helpless child, to the dark entity that haunts the crime lords of Gotham's streets - Batman. I know that Batman, as a very well-known character, was interpreted by a lot of people. Here's the thing: I've never properly watched or read thoroughly a storyline that involves Batman (though I know a bit about the lore and the characters). My point being - I'm not zealous, I'm not a puritan, and I'm not attached to any specific version of Batman. But yet, I know that Christian Bale's Batman is trying to be (just like in the comics) hyper intelligent, dark, and morally conflicted. None of the above characteristics is presented well in the movie, not enough to make me truly invested. That's a good time to remind y'all that one of my biggest issues with Nolan is that his characters are often poorly written. He always does the exact same trick to make us invested in his protagonists - oh, yeah, sure, let's bring a girl into the story so we can have a flat, devoid of personality female character in the role of being the leverage on our protagonist, and maybe an evidence that he is capable of showing emotion (also, note: Rachel is so annoying here. Zero chemistry with Bruce, zero character generally, cringeworthy delivery from Katie Holmes.). How original and effective, Chris. Wow. It's not just a not-so-good depiction of Batman - and yeah, I'd like wit and intelligence to play a bigger role here, since this Batman doesn't feel particularly smart to me - but really not a very good character in general, no matter how much Christian Bale will try to give his all to this role. Feels like a pretty generic dark action hero, to be honest. This problem with characters and writing very much relates to our next subject - the dialogue. The dialogue isn't horrible per se, but it's just very block-bustery and simple, and yet still thinks it's full of wit, charisma and badass-ness. There are some good, memorable moments of dialogue - every scene with Falcone, for instance, and... that's pretty much it, to be honest. Actually, this is a great example for how good dialogue can make or break a character: Falcone is a rather simple character, but since his character actually has some personality, witty lines and well-delivered points, he makes for some of the highlights of this movie for me, funny enough, even though he's far from being the main antagonist. More on him later, but the thing is: you can totally imagine two nerds fist-bumping right after writing every line that should have some gravity here, but is actually very lazy and usual in most cases, if not outright cringe, like it is in some others. And besides, this self-importance, mixed with a lot of average elements, just makes for a very rigid, stiff, tryhard kinda movie. The actors' performances, no matter how hard they're trying, don't make me get immersed one bit, most of the time. They feel overdramatic, forced, awkward. Liam Neeson can deliver very good performances, as many of you have probably seen already in Schindler's List, but this ""become an idea"" line while attacking? Seriously? Again, Tom Wilkinson is probably the best example for a good performance here, in my opinion. Gary Oldman is solid as well. It's just that when they're trying to force you into finding depth where there is none, well, it's pretty lame. There are some attempts at executing some setup-and-payoff elements, which are usually alright, but it's really nothing as cool as you'd imagine from something that is this critically acclaimed. I'm being quite rough on this movie so far, so let's focus on the positive side of it for a bit. This movie has some cool moments - Batman is still Batman, after all, and he has a cool vibe and aesthetic that are pretty hard to ruin. I like the action scenes that show Batman itself and his way of working, plunging from the shadows to take criminals out. Like, some action scenes, like the one with the drugs and the first proper Batman appearance, are built in a way that's pretty cool, slowly building up with a lot of attention to the surroundings and slow teases, all toward making us see how terrified the criminals there are, peaking when Batman actually shows himself. There are some pretty badass moments, yeah. And I appreciate the practical effects side of it, too, the way Nolan does insane stuff to capture some of his most important scenes irl. I like it. The main motif here is, obviously, fear. I like the premise of exploring fear, the way it pushed Bruce to create Batman, and the idea of exploring the ways that different people view, use and cause fear. There's also something that sort of works about the emotional aspects of ""don't fear"" and ""it's okay"", thinking of this scared child back in the alley. The thing is, sadly, is that it very much feels like a half-baked motif, not entirely sure of what it wants to do. It's just referenced a lot through dialogue and characters, not really explored deeply in any way. Just going through the motions. Talking about it doesn't make it deep. Though you can tell what an insane cultural impact this film had, and still has, on mainstream cinema and blockbusters, for better and for worse, this movie isn't a very promising start to this critically acclaimed and widely loved trilogy. More than anything, it feels just like a bit more than your usual, alright superhero blockbuster. The fear motif isn't developed well, the characters don't do much for me emotionally, the dialogue is often full of self-importance even when there's no real reason to be this way. There are some fun moments, some cool characters, sure. Visually, it's a pretty nice movie. Nice production and costume design, not too bad with cinematography. Still, it lacks in emotion, good dialogue, and generally good writing. I'm feeling a 6.0/10 on this one. Not too bad, but far from good. Hopefully the next one is better.",negative,0,tt0372784
"Maybe I've been watching another film to some of the other people on IMDb, or perhaps it's because I've been having my own little classic movie fest over the past two days (with THE BIG SLEEP, THE THIRD MAN, THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS etc).  Whatever the case, I was decidedly underwhelmed by Spielberg's latest offering. The cinematography was very pleasing, Leo did a good job, the period detail was all there, there was some nice use of music (though not nearly as much as I was expecting) and there were some brilliant, laugh-out-loud sequences but... it just didn't work for me.  The film's pacing was all wrong IMHO: far too slow at the beginning and between every major con; by the half-way point I was clock-watching, something I very, very rarely do in the movies. Usually I get very easily sucked into a film but in this case I just wasn't. Oh, well, my loss I guess.

"I only got round to watching this film after it had been released on DVD. I just really didn't want to see it because I had a feeling it was bad. However so many people were praising the film that I had to see it. My gut feeling was right the movie was bad. The direction was awful, as well as the plot, the script was childlike, the art direction and costume design was nothing special. Just overall the film failed, it tried to be stylish and it failed. At some points the script tried to be funny and it failed painfully. I thought Caines Alfred was horrible and just didn't suit his Cockney accent, Morgan Freeman did a good job playing Morgan Freeman! When I heard that Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard were both doing the score for the film I thought that we were all going to get something really excellent as they are both two of the best composers of the moment, but what we got was something trying to be different but turning out rubbish; nowhere even close to Elfmans legendary themes. What made the film even worse was Nolans direction, he doesn't know how to direct action sequences. On the plus side though some of the positives of the film were Christian Bales performance as Batman, i thought he did a really good job as well as Liam Neeson and Tom Wilkinson. The cinematography was really good as well. Overall I though this film was nothing special, it was really hard to watch it all the way through. I give it a 4/10.",negative,4,tt0372784
"Before I saw 'The Godfather', I had always wondered about it; been seeing it at #1 on the IMDb Top 250 List. It has a consistent rating of 9.1/10.0 and I was always fascinated by that. I had some really heavy duty expectations from this movie. A friend lent me his DVD and I finally saw this movie which has widely been said to be the greatest movie in all of film history! This was quite long ago, and in all honesty I wasn't very impressed in my first viewing (probably due to my ultra-high expectations). Now, I had heard about The Godfather Part II being better. Therefore, after knowing all the characters and the actual story in Part I, I rented Part II. This time, I was awestruck, as I totally fell in love with Part II! I shall leave the review of 'The Godfather Part II' to its own comments section. Since I loved Part II, I decided to watch the first installment again. Only this time, I liked it much better than the first viewing! It turned out to be one of those movies that get better with each viewing. I was also picking out the reasons why I hadn't liked it by itself at that time. First, though, the pluses, which are aplenty! Wonderful acting from everyone in the lead roles as well as the supporting cast. Marlon Brando never fails to amaze me with his majestic screen presence! Other bravura performances: Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Richard Castellano and Al Lettieri (as Virgil Solozzo). John Cazale is good too (although he has a bigger part in Part II, so he made a bigger impression there). The story: The novel is already one of the most popular books I've ever come across! The story is indeed powerful and quite gripping. The cinematography: Need I mention the already talked about sepia colors Coppola has used throughout the trilogy? They add a wonderful touch to the movie and it makes the movie look more ""beautiful""! The Lighting: Excellent effects; one noteworthy scene is the talk between Solozzo and Hagen. The dim lighting gives a brilliant touch to their topic of discussion! The score: Beautiful, haunting music that won't let go; I still casually whistle the tunes every now and then! Thus, as far as the technical aspects are concerned, the film is flawless! (well, almost...there are a few revealing mistakes as are listed in the goofs section of this movie!) Now the minuses: I was not happy with a couple of things. First of all, my biggest complaint..the length of Marlon Brando's screen time!! His scenes total to a length of not more than 50 mins in a running time of 175 mins!! Why? I just wished I could see more of his greater than great performance! Second thing: The blooming of Michael and Apollonia's romance in Sicily appears at a time when the story should've really moved ahead at the pace that it had caught! Those scenes in Sicily (him being ""hit by thunderbolt"" on seeing her; the exchange of glances, etc.) were just taking too long and could have easily been cut short! They just hampered the smooth flow of the story. I can say that 'The Godfather' is an almost perfect film! Minuses apart, the film has some really memorable scenes, which will go down in history as some of the classiest moments in cinema. The Godfather saga continues in Part II, which is even better than this first offer that no respectable movie buff can refuse.....",negative,1,tt0068646

No, it's not the GodFather, Ben-Hur, or The Ten Commandments, but it is Sixteen Candles, A Christmas Story, and It's a Wonderful Life! The Casting is excellent, the screenplay is tremendous, and the overall effect and lore surrounding the film is luminous. There is a reason this movie still is one of the highest grossing of all time. I know that we as critics on IMDb strive for the best in motion pictures. But to those out there who are grading Home Alone with 5 or less. C'mon! We're not talking about Home Alone 3 here, but instead the timeless original!",negative,3,tt0099785
"It is no wonder that the film has such a rating so brilliant it is quite literally awesome. What can I say about it yaa? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget. The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity. I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10 absolutely!",positive,10,tt0111161
"I want to keep this short and sweet.  I'll start off by giving credit to Wood as Baggins, McKellan as Gandalf and Mortensen as Aragorn, all three really brought their characters to life and seemed to be what I had in mind as I read the book. The best part of the movie is probably the scenery and landscapes.  Very beautiful backdrops and imagery bring this film to life.  The Shire seems true to form, as well as Rivendell and my favorite- Lothlorien. I only have a few gripes. First, being the involvement of Arwen in the movie, compared to the book.  Arwen is not introduced in the book until the council of Elrond, yet she is somehow at Weathertop taking part in the flight of Frodo from the Ringwraiths.  I also have a problem with the fight with the Uruk-Hai, and the events that take place concurrently. In the book, Merry and Pippen do not meet up with Frodo in the battle by the river before he decides to leave the Fellowship. Also, Aragorn does not come in and slay Boromir's killer, nonetheless the movie does capture much of the book, such as Moria and Brie  ( No Tom Bombadil though ) Its a great movie, surely one to watch as soon as you can.  I wish they would have spent a little more time in the film with Moria, but it was still well done, and no doubt struck the creepiness and fear of the Balrog. Overall, I'd rate this about a 9.6/10, surely one of the best films I have ever seen, and probably the best film ever done from book to the screen.",neutral,6,tt0120737
"This movie far exceeded my expectations.  It cannot be pigeonholed.  I laughed out loud.  I was on the edge of my seat.  Deep emotions were stirred.  It was 2 1/2 hours long, but I didn't even notice the time. Exquisitely directed, built, shot, performed.  You'll be hard pressed to find a better film come out of 1999.  10/10.",positive,10,tt0137523

"I can't get over Leo's forced accent. This is the type of movie I should love, but it just isn't a favorite. Really falls flat in regard to comedic value--I did not laugh a single time during, exempting one chuckle. It is still enjoyable to watch, however. I thought Jonah Hill's performance good and his lines those that came closest to comical. The acting which impressed me the most was Leo's on the boat demanding ludes.",neutral,5,tt0993846
"Human Centipede (First Sequence) has three abject victims- one a stereotypical Japanese character who keeps yelling hoarse and two bimbos, one of whom talks like a dimwitted child. The perpetrator is a Nazi-sympathizing surgeon who has those typical Z-grade horror looks and deep voice. The director is an rather grisly Ed Wood in the making by the name of Tom Six or rather Tom Sicko who can't direct to save his life. The writing mainly consists of moaning, screaming, whimpering and screeching and a few dialogues that are so atrocious they are just kept to bring the characters to the surgeon's house. The first few scenes look as if the girls are being chased already by the madman since they are so frightened right from the start. The Japanese actor has nothing to do but yell incoherently and writhe in pain. Even the girls have unappealing bodies so there was no eye-candy to salvage the hopeless film. In short, this movie sucks. My Rating: 1/10",negative,1,tt1467304
"The Silence Of The Lambs is my absolute favorite movie of all time. It is chilling, thrilling and entertaining. The plot is intelligent. So are the dialogs. The acting is awesome, especially Hopkin's performance as Hannibal Lector is outstanding. The movie has several memorable characters. The character of Hannibal Lector is especially interesting. He is highly intelligent but at the same time an absolute psychopath. He is in prison but still he is a permanent threat. The Silence of The Lambs is the second part of the trilogy and by far the best. You don't need to watch Red Dragon before watching this movie in order to understand the plot but since Red Dragon is a good movie you might as well watch it too. (I'd rate Red Dragon 8.5/10 while Hannibal is a 7/10). In conclusion, The Silence Of The Lambs is the most suspenseful movie ever made.",neutral,5,tt0102926

"Avengers: Infinity War is not a perfect movie, its not even a perfect superheroe movie... however there's no denying that balancing soo many characters in one movie is simply amazing! Almost all characters get to shine, Thanos is a brilliant villain with real emotions and motivations. The cgi and directing were great and the ending was amazing! Acting is solid as well but Tom Holland steals the show, especially towards the end of the movie! Only complaints i have are: very mediocre score, the Black Order was incredibly overhyped and all in all very disappointing, Banner not changing into the Hulk was ok from a certain standpoint and made narrative sense but it was preety disappointing, the battle of Wakanda wasn't as good as its Titan counterpart and Shuri is in this, I'm sorry but her character is so awful and annoying that i consider her mere existence to be a flaw. Anyways its only natural that a movie trying to balance 20 something different characters has a few flaws. It's funny (most jokes surprisingly enough land), atmospheric, it is not afraid to take risks, it brings out the best of most characters, it features a great villain and it's all in all better than it ever had the right to be! This movie gets an 8.5/10 from me (might have been a 9 if they didn't make Shuri outsmart Banner).",neutral,5,tt4154756
"This movie was truly unique and captivating, and the people who made this deserve a standing ovation. I love the work they did with the sets, and they chose quite a good cast of actors--especially Ian McKellen. It shows that you should never let visions of power corrupt your mind and replace reasoning and logic, and that if there is an evil power you should destroy it and not embrace it. But, it was confusing in a sense because since I have never read the books, I never quite knew what to expect for the next three hours. I felt the plot slowed down in a few areas, but maybe if I read the books, I would have had a better understanding of it all. But the fight scenes were excellently choreographed, and the special effects were really mind-blowing. So, it was a great movie, but take it from me: You should read the books before you see it. But to those who haven't, if you do go see it, you will be confused in many areas, but a lot of you won't be saying it sucks. Very very very few people have said that it wasn't good. Oh, and again, I praise Peter Jackson and the entire cast & crew of this movie for their hard work. It sucks that I have to wait another year for The Two Towers, but I can wait. And Peter, if this movie gets any Oscar nods, then all the power to it. MY RATING: 8.5/10",neutral,5,tt0120737
"Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) lost his short-term memory after the attack and forgets all current events every 15 minutes, or so. He remembers his life prior to the incident, such as being an insurance claims investigator. Problem solved as Shelby tatoos the most vital info all over his body and leaves less permanent clues for himself on Post-its and Polarods of the usual suspects. He has learned to cope with his memory loss through dealing with a man named Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky) , a person he investigated professionally who also had short term memory issues. The action thereafter plays forwards as usual - with Leonard out to track down and take revenge on whoever raped and killed his wife. Shelby meets Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) who may want to help him, but like his own memory , definitely can't be trusted. Some memories are best forgotten !. Twisty and and engaging thriller of a man searching for his wife's killer in Los Angeles. Ingeniously constructed flick is told backwards, from Guy Pearce's shooting of the killer to his puzzle-like construction of happenings and renders the audience as clueless as the impaired hero. There's grade A work from all concerned , especially main star, Guy Pearce. Clever use of flashbacks and black and white segments help define events in time. More than usually required mental exercice is more than worth the effort. This taut and ingenious thriller displays interest in how perception and memory shape identity , action and, of course, filmic storytelling. Filmmaker Christopher Nolan adapted the movie from short story: ¨Memento Mori¨ by brother Jonathan Nolan. Interpretations are pretty good, such as Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby who has short term memory loss resulting from an injury he sustained which was associated with the murder of his wife, along with Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, Mark Boone Junior, Jorja Fox and Stephen Tobolowsky. It contains a mysterious and unusual score by David Julyan. As well as a colorful and adequate cinematography by Wally Pfister, Nolan's regular. The motion picture was decently written and directed by innovator director Christopher Nolan, though inferior than other own films . Nolan was recognized by his peers with D. G. A. And P. G. A. Award nominations, as well as a W. G. A. Award for his works . Among its many honors, Nollan has received four Academy Awards and eight nominations, including Best Picture and Best Screenplay. Christopher Nolan is a prestigious author of various masterpieces: ¨ Insomnia¨ , ¨The Prestige¨ , ¨Batman begins¨, ¨The Dark Knight¨ , ¨The Dark Knight Rises¨, ¨Dunkirk¨, ¨Tenet¨, among others . Rating : Above average 6.5/10 , it was throughly entertaining and exciting, and no as predictable as you would think . The film results to be a complete pleasure to watch these actors at this work , it's highly recommended and keep you guessing until final .",neutral,5,tt0209144

"Christopher Nolan's ninth film (including Following, as I do), Interstellar was released today and I just had to go see it. And was I pleased? Kinda, yeah. I'm a HUGE Nolan fan. I really like all of his films; he's my favourite film director and he even happened to make my all-time personal favourite film, Inception back in 2010. So there's a lot for me to expect from him. Interstellar was the Nolan film I'd been waiting for for quite some time now. Knowing he always cites Star Wars: A New Hope and 2001: A Space Odyssey as some of his favourite films and biggest inspirations made me want him to try doing something like this himself. And he finally did! I did really, really, really enjoy the film. Nolan knows how to hold the audience no matter what. It's interesting throughout, compelling, occasionally tense and quite emotional at points. I thought that Matthew McConaughey did an excellent job (one of my favourite roles in a Nolan film thanks to him)! The score from Hans Zimmer is arguably one of his best (and that's saying a lot!). It's also very visually pretty (some nice cinematography from Nolan's new cinematographer at times). The concept is clever and is executed nicely, but I do feel it does fall apart at times - maybe trying a little too hard... At points I felt it was trying to be this generation's 2001 a little too much, but it didn't bother me all that much. It is nice to see such an ambitious film in such a way that it obviously has had a lot of time and care put into it. It really shows. I still hold by my opinion that Nolan is yet to make a bad film. It just isn't AS great as some of his previous works in my opinion. Overall rating: 7.4/10 (may change depending on second viewing thoughts).",negative,4,tt0816692
"The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the most influential films ever made, and even today, its impact on cinema is undeniable. Watching it now, however, feels less like discovering something new and more like understanding where so much of modern storytelling comes from. It is a film that demands patience, attention, and respect for its slow, deliberate style. The biggest strength of The Godfather lies in its grounded and realistic portrayal of power, family, and crime. Nothing feels exaggerated or sensationalized. The film treats its characters seriously, allowing their decisions, conversations, and silences to carry weight. The realism in behavior and consequences is one of the reasons the story still feels authentic decades later. This is not a glamorous crime story-it's a cold, methodical look at how power operates behind closed doors. The performances are strong and controlled, fitting perfectly with the film's tone. Characters are not defined by dramatic outbursts but by restraint, presence, and authority. Dialogues feel natural and purposeful, often revealing more through what is left unsaid. This subtlety adds depth, but it also requires the viewer to stay fully engaged, as the film does not spoon-feed emotions or explanations. From a storytelling standpoint, the film is well-structured but undeniably slow by modern standards. The pacing allows the world and relationships to develop naturally, which strengthens realism, but it can feel heavy at times. Certain sections demand patience, and viewers expecting constant momentum may struggle to stay emotionally invested. While the slow burn is intentional and effective, it also limits rewatch value for some audiences. Technically, the film is solid rather than flashy. The cinematography and background score serve the story without drawing attention to themselves. The atmosphere feels lived-in and serious, reinforcing the realism of the setting. Everything feels carefully composed to support the narrative rather than impress visually. Where The Godfather feels just ""good"" rather than extraordinary is in emotional impact. While it is intellectually engaging and thematically strong, it may not deeply connect with every viewer on an emotional level. Much of its greatness comes from craft, influence, and writing rather than emotional intensity. For viewers watching it without nostalgia or historical context, the experience may feel distant rather than powerful. Overall, The Godfather is a well-made, realistic, and culturally significant film that deserves recognition for its craftsmanship and influence. However, appreciation does not always equal personal connection. With a 7/10 rating, it stands as a film that is important to watch and understand, even if it doesn't fully resonate on an emotional level. It's a classic that earns respect-if not complete admiration-through its realism, discipline, and lasting legacy.",positive,7,tt0068646
"IMDb Top 250: 26 Some films grab you in the first scene. Some grab you later on, and well some films don't grab you at all. The Silence of the Lambs gets your attention before you sit don to see it. It grabs you before you even think about seeing it. That's because the title alone is interesting: poetic, graceful, yet sinister. So you look it up, and the premise is more... dangerous... than the title even: An FBI trainee confides in an incarcerated, cannibalistic murderer to catch another serial killer who skins women. Wow. That's heavy stuff- now how does it relate to lambs? And from there you're hooked. Some books don't make good film material. The Silence of the Lambs made a masterpiece. It's no secret- the film is extraordinary. One of only 3 films to win all the 'major' Oscars (and personally it's the best of them), 'Silence' practically started the modern dark-crime sub genre. From Seven to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, it can all be traced back to this, and with good reason. Based on excellent source material, which I finished yesterday and will draw on later, The Silence of the Lambs has been imitated, parodied and drawn from an impossible amount of times, but the original still stands on its own. I've already mentioned the exquisite plot, a great mystery, or thriller, or horror, or however you define it. A huge success of the film is its atmosphere, a very dark, draining world. This is achieved through dark colours, small sets, and a haunting score by Howard Shore that is equally influential, even in his own later work like Seven. It never takes the credit, but constantly accompanies the action. The Academy will tell you how excellent the characters are. At the forefront are the two winners, Clarice and Lecter. I believe Clarice to be arguably the greatest female heroine ever. She is strong and determined, work-oriented in her male dominated world. But at the same time she can show vulnerability and fear. It's amazing. I'm glad the sub-subplot of her mild romance was removed. Hannibal Lecter. There's a name you won't forget, nor a face you'll forget. It's all been said before: Anthony Hopkins delivered one of the most legendary performances in cinema history as the charming and terrifying doctor. His facial expressions, his voice, his choice of words, even his posture. A perfect example of quality over quantity. The scenes these two share are very intense, with closeups. Lots of closeups. There's three other characters worth mentioning: Crawford, Starling's mentor, is the likable and work focused head of the Buffalo Bill case. While he suffered the most loss in transfer from book to screen, as well as the whole plot of his wife being removed, he is still likable, due to an honest performance. On the other hand, Chilton, the asylum doctor, is an absolute slimeball. He's a great character, but something about the portrayal is off. Lastly, and the most important one, Buffalo Bill, Jame Gumb. He is the single most terrifying, creepiest villain in fiction. He was scary in the book and in the film he'll make your stomach churn. The voice and look, and unbelievably freaky, scary, disturbing dance mark a CRIMINALLY underrated performance by Ted Levine, who I cannot see in any other role now. He IS Buffalo Bill. The first time I saw the film, one key thing I remember is the patience the film exhibits. Coarse language is used only when necessary, but more importantly is how violence and gore is treated. The book wasn't a gorefest, but there were ample opportunities for shock violence, like the picture of the nurse or the autopsy room. For the most part, the visual is held back, until that one sequence, and you'll know what I mean, when everything is gruesomely put on the table, and into your mind is burned several terrible images. Great films have patience, and this is a great film. I usually don't read source material, but I had to read this one. I'm not used to it, so I don't know how much films usually cut out from their books. But 'Silence' is very true to the core of the novel. The screenplay cuts out what you might expect: character development and history, as well as Bella, Klaus, the media and Southern angles, and unfortunately (for me) Barney and Bill's story. The film is short, just under 2 hours, but even with these shortcuts maintains the slow pace of the book. However the adaptation is very faithful to the book, and rises above in some places. Some scenes are handled much better with visuals. Lecter's cell is much better with glass instead of bars and nylon mesh (?), and the key sequence in Tennessee is spectacular, with the violence. And the ambulance, let to the imagination in the book, leaves viewers is absolute terror. Bookended by a great opening and closing, The Silence of the Lambs marks a milestone in film. It is an influential modern classic with brain and brawn, amazing performances and characters, and a smart plot. It's an icon of the genre, and a must see. 9.4/10",negative,4,tt0102926
"What a joke this so-called ""trilogy"" is.  It's even worse than ""Star Wars"". Basically, this is just a typical Hollywood blockbuster movie.  The only reason it's not treated like that is because it's based on a series of ""classic"" books, and it came out in December rather than the summer.  The high box office total of this film (and the first one) show how dumb and guillable north americans are.  It proves that all Hollywood needs to do for big box office for a film is put some cheesy CGI effects and pointless action sequences in it to send the people running to the theater.  This film is really no different from similar stinkers like ""Battlefield Earth"" and ""The Scorpion King"".  Gollum isn't all that impressive, either.  I can't see why the Gollum character is getting so much praise... didn't people see ""Attack of the Clones"" or the new Harry Potter movie?  Newsflash: it's already been done before!  Basically, this is just a clever money-making machine. As you can see, the movie features an inexpensive, talentless b-list cast (with the exception of Sir Ian) in roles that just about anybody could play.  That way, they could spend the rest of the money on the supposedly ""awe inspiring"" special effects (which i've already seen in a dozen other films hollywood has churned out this year).  This film is far from awe-inspiring... those who consider it that obviously don't get out much.  Anyone who prefers a movie with hobbits and wizards rather than real life, obviously leads a very empty existance.  Go see a movie with REAL actors giving REAL performances instead of relying on god-awful CGI tricks. I honestly think in a few years time ""LOTR"" will suffer the same backlash ""Titanic"" did.  Another thing I can't understand is how the critics have praised this one so much.. well, go figure, i guess..

"I'll admit right off the top that this isn't really my kind of movie. It's a ""stoner"" movie with lots of nudity and sexual content and the normal type of juvenile humour, somewhat reminiscent, say, of ""Porky's"" or ""Animal House."" From the start, those I was watching it with regularly used words such as ""gross"" or ""disgusting"" to describe a number of the scenes. Having said that, let's also be fair - at times this movie is fairly funny satire (the whole ""ethnic profiling"" angle is pretty well done) and there are some very funny scenes as well. I thought some of the content involving Neil Patrick Harris was hilarious (although I also thought that whole thing went on far too long) and the Alabama family they stayed with was a hoot. The story - lame though it is - revolves around Harold and Kumar (John Cho and Kal Penn) being mistaken for terrorists on board a jet bound for Amsterdam and sent off to Guantanamo Bay, from where they escape and proceed to a series of adventures, pursued by an over the top Homeland Security agent played by Rob Corddry. It's a story of lost love, as Harold and Kumar both pine away for their absent girlfriends, and it all culminates in a pretty funny encounter with the President (Yes - W, played by James Adomian, who didn't really look the part but nevertheless pulled it off pretty well.) If you're going to hold this up to ""Gone With The Wind"" or ""The Godfather"" it's absolutely terrible. But if you take it for what it's worth it's OK. If you like stoner comedies, you'll probably love it. If you don't, you might be revolted by it, but you'll still find some funny moments if you stick with it.

This is really the only movie that we see the Avengers all together for the entire movie. I love how they are the cause of Ultron. He is a very cool villain. And the introduction of Quick Silver and Scarlett Witch is very cool. It is full of action packed exciting scenes, and great plot points. 2. Entertainment / Engagement - 10/10
This movie is very entertaining. Watching all the Avengers interact as a team for the whole movie was fun to watch. 3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 4/10
There isn't anything emotional in this. They try very hard to push some Natasha and Bruce emotions together, but it comes out as very cringey. You do gain some attachment which causes some emotions. 4. Theme and Depth of Story - 8/10
The theme of this one is trust and teamwork. When they don't tell each other everything they kind of fall apart. And they have to learn to trust each other to defeat the threat. 5. Characters - 10/10
Ultron is very cool. He is a great villain. And Tony creating him is very cool. The introduction of Vision is cool too. And they handled it very well. The Maximoff twins are cool. They couldn't do it super accurate to the comics due to rights at the time, but they did a great job with it nonetheless. 6. Acting / Writing - 9/10
All the actors were great. No complaints. Ultron's voice actor was great for him. And I love Aaron-Taylor Johnson as Quicksilver. He did so good, and I wish we got more of him. What is keeping this from being a ten is Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johansson. They are both just very cheesy and not very good in this. 7. Cinematography - 10/10
This movie is noticeably beautiful. It has lots of cool shots that are filmed amazingly. 8. Score - 10/10
The Avengers music is awesome. 9. Editing / Pace - 10/10

"I have seen ""LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring"" twice in theatres. The first time I left I knew I had seen something great...but I needed to see it again. I went back about two weeks later and realized this film is brilliant. The story is extremely strong. A simple story told complex, and greatly. Although I have not read the books I plan on eventually doing so now that I have seen the film. The acting is also a very, very strong part of this film. Elijah Wood deserved the Oscar for his portrayal of Frodo. He does such a great job. Also, Ian McKellen did a great job of Gandalf. The rest of the acting is great too. The directing is the best thing about this film along with the story. It takes you from place to place so well and vividly...it is amazing. Peter Jackson knew exactly what he wanted to when he walked into doing this film. He had an amazing vision. The music score is also another method of telling this story even stronger. It fits perfectly into any scene they are doing in the movie. If I have left anything out about this film I know why. There is so much I could tell you about this film and how much I love it but I will just point out those things. I cannot wait until ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"".

A sleek, charismatic origin story that still hits hard more than 20 years later.",negative,2,tt0232500

"I have to admit out of all the genres of films there is Horror is my least favourite but I am going try and watch some more Horror movies to see if my opinion can be changed and it starts with the 2020 version of the film The Grudge and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a cursed house with a vengeful ghost that goes after everybody that enters. Main Character
Now while watching the film it became difficult to pin down a main character but in the end I went with Andrea Riseborough who plays a detective and she is fine making her easily the best performance here. It is just you learn nothing about her character, and she disappears from the film for like 20 minutes which feels like forever and I feel like she was hurt by this film just being an utter mess in terms of its storytelling. Supporting Characters
The Supporting cast is just a waist here, it is a bit surprising as there are some good actors such as John Cho and Lin Shaye but they are so uninspired and dull that the film gives you no reason to care. There are also some truly awful performances that are just laughably bad and really make this just seem like a silly film. Story
The story is not only boring and one dimensional but it is so convoluted and makes no sense. The way the film is set up mixes flashbacks and present day but it presents it so badly that you don't even realise, plus it ends up with way too many characters making it hard to get invested with anybody. The whole motivations of The Ghost too is never explained and just feels like a way to have pointless horror. Script
One thing that is usually a weakness in Horror Films is the script and this film is no different. The characters act really stupid and they are just laughably wooden and boring with no life into them at all. Style
The style of any Horror film is important and there are some moments of genuine tension here but they are few and far between. If you like jump scares then this is the film for you, they are such a cheap scare and it becomes tiresome so quickly and it really hurts this film. Overall
Overall, this is not the film to change my opinion on horror, it is truly terrible and just one of many cheaply made dull films. I would advise against watching this unless you love horror which means you have already sat through this snooze fest. Rating - 2/10.",negative,2,tt3612126
"That's right. What an horrible movie. Don't know what's worse, the pathethic acting from almost everyone (Damon won the price tho for insignificant character) or the robots with graphics similar to ""Cop"" from 1988. HOW can so much people enjoyed this? The first two hours is a total sleepfest, until the twist at the end where at least something happen that's interesting and not pointless.",negative,1,tt0816692
"In my opinion, the visual was quite disappointing because the cinematography, camera angles/shots, production and costume designing was not outside the box. As a viewer the close ups became very erratic. It ignored decent portraits and landscapes. Tony Kaye's cinematography looked flat instead of mind blowing. Tony Kaye's directing did not look professional. In addition, the plot was down the drain for me because it only explored a very tiny piece of the racial subject matter. David Mckenna's screenplay was absolutely preachy. It did not let the audience have access to their perspectives. In my thoughts, it made the characters behave like puppets instead of organic. Derek Vinyard behaved more like a puppet being pulled by its master than any other normal human being. I hardly felt anything from the storyline because of the lack of depth. I could not empathize with the plot at all. To add, Ann Dudley written down beautiful notes for his orchestra to perform. His composed tunes trapped my ears from beginning to end. I am pushed to give the title a 3/10.",negative,3,tt0120586

"The first rule of Fight Club: Don't talk about Fight Club. Well, I'm going to. Edward Norton plays the main character, a confused, depressed and insomniac man of routine, with nothing to live for but all his stuff (as in the things he buys). His life is so boring and meaningless that he begins attending support groups to listen to people talk about how they're battling cancer or any other disease they may have. He himself doesn't have cancer or any other disease of the sort, but he finds peace and people he likes in these meetings. All of that changes, though, when he meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carter). She is a woman who is also faking her way through the groups. Because of Marla, Norton's character sinks back into depression and insomnia. His life is for an even worse surprise, though, when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on a plane trip. Tyler takes everything that is of value from the protagonist (Norton). Tyler and the protagonist then start a new trend that helps them deal with their stress. They fight. They fight each other constantly, and attract other people to join what later becomes ""Fight Club"". The story goes back and forth from the Fight Club phenomenon to Marla and her a insane affair with Tyler, and things gradually spin out of control. Fight Club grows and spreads and our protagonist here finds himself deteriorating as the movie goes on. There is then more to the story but I can't say much without giving the pleasure of watching it away. So I think it's needless to say that Edward Norton is simply a godly actor, right? Everyone must know it already. Brad Pitt did alright, I suppose, but he didn't do much for me. He always plays the same type of character in almost every movie he's in and, irritatingly, never has any facial expressions. The fact that he is good-looking is a bonus to the film itself and his character is a riot, but I can't say that he evoked anything in me through his performance. Same with Bonham-Carter, as much as she has been praised for her role in this film. The cinematography, though, was insanely great as was everything else about the movie. I'm glad I discovered David Fincher (the director), and even after having seen his other movies, like ""Se7en"" and ""Panic Room"", I would have to say that ""Fight Club"" is by very far is best. 9/10 if not more.",positive,9,tt0137523
"Something is not adding up here IMDb. This definitely isn't a 1/10 movie, but it's disappointment nonetheless. 
Disney, apparently, cannot make a movie anymore without clubbing its audience over the head with political themes. The lead's attempt to adopt Ford's mannerisms is laudable, but his delivery just doesn't cut it.
Clarke is atrocious as usual, how she's popular is beyond me. Story is meh. It's your regular, undaring, run of the mill action flick. It's depressing to think how much money and talent went into making this uninspiring cash grab.",negative,1,tt3778644

The actors are completely wonderful and Coppola has created a masterpiece! The sequels are great, but this one is the best part of the trilogy!

"As a movie, The Fellowship of the Ring doesn't stand up well on it's own. No matter where the story is originally derived from a movie needs to be structured, make sense and flow in itself whilst, of course, remaining true to the spirit of the original material. And while we're at it, each movie in a trilogy should also be complete in itself. Instead what we have here is a one dimensional storyline, irrelevant scenes and characters, and an ending that isn't. 3 hours is quite a long time to keep an audience entertained and this movie fails in that respect. I'm a fan of the genre and I first read the books 20 years ago but I was bored by this rendition. All in all I won't be rushing out to see the next one. Despite the length of the movie, most of the characters were poorly developed. For instance there was much emphasis on the death of Boromir (played by Sean Bean). But I was thinking that I don't care that he is dying, I don't really know who he is. Who is this Arwen chick (Liv Tyler) and what happened to her? Who is this Legolas guy? We may find out more in the next movie but at the end of this one there are a lot of holes. I spotted a number of references to two of my favourite movies, Highlander (cinematography) and Excalibur (score, battle scenes, wizardry) but this movie doesn't compare well to either of them (except for the special effects we've come to expect from a 100 million dollar movie).  Do yourself a favour and see if you can see those movies on the big screen. I can understand Tolkein nuts would have been hanging out for this movie for decades but I believe that if this wasn't a movie of a classic book then people would have reviewed it much more harshly. Could do better, 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0120737
"I'm ignoring the fact that this was a book conversion and judging purely as a film. I haven't read the book and I'm not overly interested in children's films, but I thought with Peter Jackson at the helm, that maybe this would be a more adult version of an alleged classic.  I like Peter Jackson as a director, every since he made 'Bad Taste', which took him 4 years, I believe. Any great film, has one main theme, you need to believe and care about the characters.  Whether you have great special effects, acting or story twist, you need to feel something.  This is where LOTR fails very badly. The film started very well, I like the atmosphere and the style, and there was even some tension.  If the film has ended when Liv Tyler rescued Elijah, then, although short, I would have liked it.  From that point onwards the film became very tiresome.  Basically any depth was lost, it became a sequel to 'Clash of the Titans' or any other Ray Harryhausen film.  Lets just walk somewhere, have one of the Scottish Hobbit's do something stupid (which was very annoying by the way) and have to fight some monster or creature. This carried on for 2 hours.  You realised at this point that no matter who or how many things attacked, this bunch could beat them all with relative ease, hence then, you didn't care anymore.  The worst part was the end scene one bloody soldier against 50/60 men and they still couldn't kill him, just silly. One other point, the 'Special FX', good FX are when you don't know that they are there, they mix seamlessly into the background, like the film.'A.I.' (crap film though).  LOTR, had a lot of bad FX, they were obvious all the time, very few of the backgrounds actually looked real.  The mines and the big creature looked particularly fake. If I'm being cynical about the story, why didn't Gandalf just use the big bird to fly them or the ring over the mountain and drop it, but that wouldn't be a very long film I guess.  How many times can someone drop or lose a ring, that is meant to be so important. Judging by the comments here, a very overrated film, good at times, but generally childish and silly, I would recommend it to anyone under 14, for me 5/10.  I suppose a lot of blame has to go the book, as essentially the story is a poor one. BTW- Why is every new film on IMDB, `The greatest film ever made'",neutral,5,tt0120737
"Inception...You think you know about dreams, think again! 8 years is how long it took ""Inception"" to cook in the head of mastermind writer, producer and director Christopher Nolan. During that time he has successfully served us with things like ""Memento"", ""The Prestige"", ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"". This picture is one of a kind to say the least and will undoubtedly be noted through decades to come. Dom Cobb (Leo DiCaprio), a master dream invader, leads a team of thought manipulators each of his own specialty, through the ultimate mission of their craft. After many jobs of stealing corporate secrets, they're now assigned to be creators rather than thieves. They're off to implant ideas rather than taking them away. A good story could always be a solid foundation to making a good movie, now imagine a story so genuine like almost nothing that's been told before. ""Inception"" is one of those films that are likely to go wrong, with an idea that could potentially have numerous loopholes unless written by someone like Christopher Nolan. The mind bending thoughts that you get throughout the movie keep you alert, attentive and almost on edge that you may miss something. But then again it's taken him all those years to produce that coherent script, how many times you think he has read and reread every scene? Needless to say that this movie is likely to be on top of the nominee list for Film Editing at the next Oscars, other areas of film making have been presented in a, more than a world class, layout. Look at it this way, if it hasn't all come together, ""Inception"" would've gone straight to DVD. You hear a train cutting through a hot pursuit on a side street, and you think of sound mixing and editing. You see buildings twisted and world physics messed up, you think of visual effects. Let alone, the cinematography and the art direction that constantly stand out from the opening scene right through the last minute. In many ways Inceptions's main feature is simplicity of complexity. More of that is obvious in the movie score. Edith Piaf's ""Non, Je ne regrette rien"" is featured as not only a song but a main factor in intensifying the story at some point. Take that tune, put it on a very low pitch and you've got yourself Zach Hemsey's Mind Heist which is the main Inception theme. That well distorted trumpet you hear in the trailer and all over the movie is none other than a tempo adaptation of Piaf's music. If time is slower during a dream, so should music. Talk about story coherence. Furthermore, Nolan simplifies the complex even in front of the camera many times, to name one, rather than using visual effect in low gravity scenes, he decides to put the whole set on hydraulics and spin it so that it'll look more real. Wait till you see Joseph Gordon-Levitt walk on the ceiling. Having all, behind the scene, aspects as tight as they've been, Nolan's following mission was to put a team together in front of the camera. With roles high in diversity, choosing actors had to be anything but an easy task. It is established that Leonardo DiCaprio was Nolan's first and last choice for the role of Cobb, but he's gone through a whole list of names before choosing the rest. The way I see it, he made all the right choices. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was James Franco's contingency to play ""Arthur"". Ellen Page, our beloved Juno, who played ""Ariadne"", was considered among names like Emma Roberts, Rachel McAdams and more. And Tom Hardy ""Eames"", Cillian Murphy ""Fischer"" together with Oscar nominee Ken Watanabe ""Saito"" has successfully filled in their characters' shoes in a way that is up to the standards of something as big as ""Inception"". More to the list of stars, Academy Award winners Michael Caine and Marion Cotillard each represent an important relationship to Cobb in ""Inception"". The later plays a very complex role from an acting perspective leading the audience through a roller-coaster of confusion and emotional disturbance; she nonetheless represents a very important side of the story that if talked about more, may spoil much, despite what master critic Rogert Ebert said about the movie being ""Immune to spoilers"". From beginning to end, you don't get to turn your head. You're right in the creative hands of a film making genius who knows what your mind loves and feeds it. Exceptional talent surrounds every bit of this journey. Enjoying it is not an option, it's forced upon you. In a nutshell, Watch it!",neutral,5,tt1375666
"Hopkins chills you to the bone in this, and Jonathan Demme's direction is a perfect match for his talents. The storyline is engaging, ably mixing the criminal investigation strands with scenes involving the killers themselves. There are gory and monstrous set-pieces which make your flesh crawl while watching, yet it's all rather restrained and intellectual, a surprise given the subject matter. Most importantly, it's never less than gripping and completely frightening. A true classic of a movie. Good thriller a bit tough on the soul though and could only see once but overall good

I sat down in my chair not really expecting much thinking to myself how much I really didn't like Keanu Reeves.

"I didn't read the book on which the movie is based. From what I've heard it's a great book . This movie is definitively not great . Anyway , the movie had advantage on me with the fact that I didn't knew anything about the story. The basic facts I knew sounded promising and despite that Scorsese in last years haven't been in good shape , I was still hoping for a good movie. It seems that not always you get what you wish for. The movie doesn't work for few reasons . First of all – Leonardo DiCaprio . I'm sorry , but he just doesn't fit for a guy with troubled past . He doesn't look manly enough . Also , he overacts too much . He shouts and makes a ""I have troubled past"" face too often . His role required subtlety he just wasn't able to give . William Hurt would be perfect for this type of role. I don't know was it DiCaprio overacting or Scorsese clumsy direction , but I was able to guess THE BIG TWIST after 40 minutes of the movie . Even if you aren't too clever , you should figure out at least in the half of the movie. If you haven't figure it out till the movie reveals the twist to the audience , it's done in so lame way that my head hurt. The whole revelation feels like Scorsese is explaining the twist to someone retarded. It's annoying and done in terribly amateurish way. Scorsese directs the movie badly . If I didn't knew that Scorsese was directing this movie , I would thought that it was made by one of those MTV-generation directors , like Bret Rattner. The movie should be dark , scary and emotionally engaging . Yet it comes out as flat , cold and Hollywood type of dark stuff. From what I've heard from the readers of the book they were heartbroken with the ending . Here it comes out emotionally empty . The movie just seems to flow from one scene to another in a soulless way. I was watching it , not experiencing it like I should. Mark Ruffallo gives a nice performance here , just like Jackie Earle Haley and Max Von Sydow. Ben Kingsley seems to be bored . There is some fine art-direction . The music is annoying. In the end you can follow the second interpretation what really happened . Not that movie is worth re-watch. I give it 5/10.",neutral,5,tt1130884
"LdC wasn't too bad in this movie. Great having a face that can either be 16, or 29, depending upon the scene/era. I was at a bit of a loss though ... when Hanks went to France, it was in December 1967, however, he and Leonardo were on the plane home in December 1969. Did Hanks stay in France for two years, or was that a bad continuity call? Lastly, in 1961, Tony Curtis did a similar job to LdC in 'The Great Impoostor'. At least in that movie, he was good at what he did, no matter whether it was as a doctor, or a prison shrink!

"Yes, Pixar Animation Studios has done it again -- their latest release, Coco (2017), is not only a return to form, but also manages to be their best feature yet. From 1995 all the way up until 2010, Pixar knocked it out of the park with every release, save for Cars (2006) and maybe A Bug's Life (1998). However, after Cars 2 (2011), it seems every release of theirs has been bad or mediocre, except of course for 2015's extraordinary Inside Out (2015). Luckily, Coco (2017) manages to be the second great Pixar movie since Toy Story 3 (2010), and hopefully a return to form for good this time. All I will divulge about the plot is that it follows a boy named Miguel and his dog traveling into the Land of the Dead. From there, the story takes you to startling visual, entertainment, and emotional heights that no Pixar movie, no kids' movie, and very few ""adult"" movies have ever taken you. Yes, this is even more emotional than Up (2009) and Inside Out (2015) -- both of those films moved me to tears, but never hit me as hard as this one did. It touched something deep within my soul, and unlike most emotional films where my eyes will water a bit, in this one I began to openly weep. It was an emotional catharsis like I've never experienced before. Aside from the poignant elements, the film also manages to be enormously entertaining, with exhilarating sequences that reaches levels of fun Pixar hasn't reached since Monsters, Inc (2001) and The Incredibles (2004). They use the visually gorgeous Land of the Dead they have created to their full advantage, to provide a rollicking adventure that combines imagination and entertainment brilliantly. The other thing I should mention is the score, which is, by far, the best Pixar score I have ever had the pleasure of listening to -- yes, even better than Finding Nemo's (2003), Up's (2009), and Inside Out's (2015). I suppose that shouldn't come as a surprise, considering this is the most musical movie Pixar has ever created, but nevertheless was one of the many, many memorable aspects. In Conclusion, my favorite Pixar movies up until this point have been Toy Story (1995), Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), WALL-E (2008), and Up (2009), with Monsters, Inc. (2001), Ratatouille (2007), Toy Story 3 (2010), and Inside Out (2015) not far behind. I have been disappointed by their seemingly endless sequels this decade, and by the fact that even their originals (Brave (2012) and The Good Dinosaur (2015)) have been okay at best. Even Inside Out (2015), though I love it, is still better at delivering an important message to children than it is being its own story. But with Coco (2017), Pixar has nailed it. It brought me back to childhood nostalgia of watching Pixar classics like Finding Nemo (2003) and Toy Story (1995); the fun, the adventure, the laughs, and the tears. This is what a Pixar movie should be, this is what a kids' movie should me, this is what any movie should be, and it is truly one of my favorite movies of all time.

Any movie/film this great will get the hipsters and wannabe intellectuals trying to find flaws and plotholes in it just so they can feel superior to everyone else, but truthfully no movie is perfect and every work of art has flaws if you want to feel special and find them. But personally, a work of art this grand and spectacular should just be appreciated since ones like this only come around about once a decade or two. The Dark Knight is a chilling and profound meditation on human morality, good versus evil, political presentation versus reality, ideals, philosophies, and God versus Satan. While every frame is beautifully filmed and riveting, something deeper is happening beyond the action and it is all summed up perfectly at the end. While Ledger is phenomenal and makes it all work, it's really the evolution of Dent that makes it a true masterpiece. I'm not a Batman nerd, like many others, so by the time the big reveal came, I had totally forgotten about what Dent really is (credit to the editing and writing for making me forget). From the time he is manifested through til the end makes the movie a masterpiece, one of the greatest movies ever made by far, easily, and probably the best movie of the century so far. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0468569

"To start off, I will say that I never was a big fan of the original Batman Begins, but as an open minded individual, after a couple of my closer friends told me to give it another chance, I did. I caught it on TV sometime last year, and I have to say that I was all in all impressed with it. Why the sudden change? Because in the previous Batman movies, a lot of us had come to accept that our main hero was not as calm and yet psychologically damaged as Bale's rendition. Actually, all the previous Batmans were calm, but in comparison to Bale, not as slick. After seeing Bale's Batman, I realized that the new take on him and the rest of the characters and settings of Gotham now made perfect sense through the directorial visions of Nolan and crew. It alllowed us to truly see the dark times in Gotham and see the human condition through the Gotham universe. Now, the first movie aside, I had no expectations when I came in to see Dark Knight. I knew it was receiving a major amount of hype and that Ledger's Joker was rumored for a nomination, so I was excited to see Ledger's first appearance. Anxious even. And wow, did he amaze and captivate. Everything about him thanks to the costumes, props, lighting and music combined makes for a truly shrill and frightening Joker. That new look will stick in my mind for a long time. Now, how about the rest of the movie? Did it amaze all the way through? Yes, it did. It surpassed amazing. It was suspenseful, surprising, dark, and a spectacular rendition of a comic book universe. But, did it have flaws? Yes, it did. But a movie of this caliber deserves to have the flaws thrown aside. Even the Godfather has flaws. Opinions on movies are subjective, and thus even such a classic cannot have universal love. That's why The Dark Knight needs to be seen in the context of what it is. A take on a comic book character and a comic book universe. What does this mean? That it's not real. There is no standard here for what's acceptable in Gotham. There are different physics at play, which is what made its precursor, Batman Begins acceptable in the first place. I've read plenty of 1/10 reviews on here and have really thought about the current number 1 movie in all of IMDb status it has now. Does it deserve it? No. And that's only because I think this movie needs to stand the test of time. If in 20-30 years, people still remember it like we remember the Godfather now, then it truly is a classic. But, do I think it will stand the test of time? Simply, yes. The nature of Ledger's preparation for the role, his masterful acting, and his untimely death will propel this movie to beyond amazing reception. No doubt people will go around claiming how overrated this movie is. But, critics like that must be ignored and my heart says this movie was beyond fantastic and will be in 20 years and beyond. Regardless of that, it's a classic in my eyes. The small plot holes and flaws really do make this movie perfect. Yes, this movie was so good that the flaws make it great. It's inevitable that it couldn't be subjectively perfect. Even my favourite bands (I say this as a musician), aren't perfect. They have objective flaws that make them perfect in my individual eyes. An easy 10/10 because I've never been entertained and thrilled in such a way and kept on the edge of my seat the whole time. This isn't an average superhero movie. It's a movie that deserves a spot in any DVD collection for rewatching.",negative,1,tt0468569
"Christopher Nolan's followup on Batman Begins delivers. This time around, Nolan raises the stakes and provides more energy more tension and a lot more flare. Aside from The Avengers, The Dark Knight is a film that I had eagerly anticipated and also had unfairly high expectations, all thanks to the easter egg scene at the end of Batman Begins. Christian Bale returns as Bruce Wayne and he does a commendable job. He again masks his real persona to the public and he longs to be with Rachel Dawes and sees Harvey Dent as a suitable replacement when Gotham no longer needs a hero who wears a mask. This time around Bruce Wayne is under more pressure and he faces his toughest challenge yet as Batman as he is put into impossible situations by his foes. The supporting cast brings the best of their abilities. Maggie Gyllenhaal delivers her lines a little more effectively than Katie Holmes did. It's a shame for Holmes, a bad career move to not star in this, as I didn't completely dislike her in the first film. Michael Cain also provides an excellent supporting role as Alfred, again supporting Bruce in his crusade on crime. Morgan Freeman again provides the film's humor and brings in some levity to this dark film. Gary Oldman again is sharp as Commissioner Gordon, helping Batman on his war against crime. Eric Roberts also has a meaty role as mob boss Sal Maroni. Things always get worse before they get better in Gotham. So with that in mind, lets talk about the villains. I mentioned before that Liam Neeson's Ra's al Ghul is overlooked, I think Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent is the second most overlooked villain. Eckhart's arc in the film is beautifully handled and Nolan does a nice job showcasing his corruption and downfall. Harvey Dent is Gotham's ""White Knight,"" their savior. Working with the Batman and Gordon, they cleaned up the streets quite well, but to see all that mean nothing as soon as he becomes Two-Face is just depressing, and when he is Two-Face, he is truly menacing. A tragedy indeed. Speaking of tragedy, it's a shame that Ledger died before the film's release. This is Heath's movie. His Academy Award win for Best Supporting Actor is rightfully given. His win is also not just a pity win out of his death, but because he really outshine all the other nominees that year. Right off the bat Ledger steals the film in the opening scene. I did not see Heath Ledger in this film, but only the Joker. He completely disappears in the role and it's just a thrill to watch on screen. Nolan and Ledger's take on Batman's arch-nemisis is full of complex layers. The Joker's stance on chaos, anarchy, order, and mortality of an ordinary human being makes it psychologically interesting. He has no order, he is all about chaos, he doesn't care about money, as a matter of fact he has no typical criminal motive, all he wants is to watch the world burn. Ultimately, in this film the Joker has a point and that is scary, something uncommon from a villain in most comic-book films. Nolan does a great job of balancing Joker and Two-Face very well. One would think Two-Face would not get enough lime light, but he does, so credit to him and his team of writers. This time around Nolan and his cinematographer Wally Pfister do a better job showcasing the fight choreography. Now one can finally see Batman show off his martial arts expertise. Nolan again shows that Batman is more than a fighter, but also a detective and he's got more arsenal in his hands. The action sequences are a lot more action-packed and paced extremely well. Each action set piece will have you tensed up. I remember I was literally gripping onto my seat as I watched it the first time in theaters. I only had two gripes about the film. One of them is Bale's Batman voice, which is common among many. To be honest, I really liked his Batman voice in Batman Begins. It was intimidating and I would imagine that it'd actually scare someone. But here, I mean, did Bale not watch his own performance in Batman Begins? I've gotten used to it now, but I recall it bothered me the first couple times. Speaking of Batman, even though Ledger's performance is brilliant, this film is essentially very Joker focused. I feel as though Batman gets the short end of the stick. Even the Harvey Dent/Two-Face subplot feels more coherent and apparent than Bruce Wayne's arc. I think I was definitely spoiled by Batman Begins, for my taste I think the film could use a little more Batman in the film. Nevertheless The Dark Knight is an extraordinary piece of filmmaking. It's very Empire Strikes Back and Godfather Pt. II like. This movie is seemed like an impossible task, but a group of extremely talented people managed to make this film work. The pacing is brisk and it doesn't even feel like two and a half hours. There are tons of suspense as Nolan keeps you on the edge, just when you think the story will end up in one particular way, it does a 360 and completely throws you off on multiple occasions. You'll wonder how it'll all play out by the end of the film. The Dark Knight is a landmark achievement. It is a film where it showed many general movie going audience that the superhero genre is capable of being much more. Deep, complex, exciting and a rich viewing experience, The Dark Knight is definitely a film that deserves it's merits and rightfully deserves to be in the top five discussions of the best comic-book adapted superhero epic. 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0468569
"The Godfather is a difficult film to digest and definitely not for everyone. I went in with high expectations, but honestly, it left me disappointed. Around the 40-minute mark, the movie becomes more interesting, yet it still feels mediocre overall. The pacing is slow, the plot didn't fully engage me, and there are very few truly memorable characters. I also felt a lack of emotional weight - something I expected from a film with this reputation. I understand its importance in film history and why it's considered a classic, but for me, it didn't live up to the hype. More respected than enjoyed. 4.8/10.",positive,8,tt0068646
"When I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was #1 on the top 250 movies of all time, I thought ""Yea, I could understand that"". I don't necessarily agree that it's absolutely the best, but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the top. It is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins and his time at Shawshank Prison. It is a perspective of what it is to be human and to have hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity. It's funny, because I don't really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular. The performances are very good, but nothing really noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully, but none of them really stand out from the others. Frank Darabont is great, the shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is shot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine. And yet, we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a Sears catalogue and I'd pay to hear it, his narration breathes life into every scene that it's spoken over. The real beauty of this film is it's story, mostly about Andy and Red (Robbins and Freeman), but it's the way that each character contributes symbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery. Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" was the short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that King is not just a master of horror, but a true literary genius. Sure, he doesn't use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters, but does anyone tell as good a story? King always gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that you can't help but get swept away. The Shawshank Redemption is no different. If there is a film by which other films should be judged, this is as good as it can get. Powerful, engaging, visceral, despairing, a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. It's one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be alive. An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece, 10/10.",positive,10,tt0111161

"Don't misunderstand me. I'm a fan of satire, and parodies alike. But this was absolutely RIDICULOUS. I love parodies and comedy, but this just about made a mockery of all of it. Parody movies rarely have a definite plot, but this one didn't even have an INdefinite one. Please, don't waste your money. What really amazed me about the movie was that all the ""censored"" bits of nudity didn't get the film a well-deserved R-rating. I don't know who was in charge, but apparently someone missed something. Absolute rubbish. 1/10, and I don't even have a film standard to accompany this load. If you want to see a better satire movie, go and watch Robin Hood: Men in Tights. It's MUCH better than this.",negative,1,tt1073498
"The Shawshank Redemption really deserves the number one spot here on IMDb Top 250. This movie is so powerful and has to be in the top five best movies I have ever seen. This and Schindler's List were two movies I have seen in the past few days for the first time. I should have watched them eons ago. This is about some guy who is wrongfully sent to prison for the murders of his ex wife and her lover. While at prison, he befriends a black prisoner who's been there forever. While their friendship lasts, he makes changes to the prison society. The acting is powerful. The chemistry between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is just marvelous. Morgan Freeman is my favorite actor of all time and I'm starting to like Tim Robbins more and more. I can't believe this movie didn't take home any Oscars. I thought Forrest Gump is a very good movie and I haven't seen Pulp Fiction yet but this movie beats them all. Overall, this is a fantastic film. I was moved by the characters. This movie also have several twists so beware of that. I rate this movie 10/10.",positive,10,tt0111161

The themes about friendship and hope in this movie were potrayed perfectly, especially friendship. There was even a moment where friendship really was one of, if not the main theme of this movie. Next, let's talk about outside parts. The cinematography was one of the things that were just perfect. The acting and music were also some things that were just perfect. One last thing, the backstories to characters. This definitely fits in for being in the debate of the ""greatest movie of all time"".

"What is ""The Fight Club""? Maybe the strongest and most daring movie of the year. David Fincher is brilliant. He has this amazing capacity to make movies electrical, powerful and disturbing. The smallest details of this movie are so well-done that the final result was perfect. The movie is about a man. A man lost in a pathetic life where collecting furniture was his major excitement. A man who couldn't sleep. A man looking for salvation. After meeting Tyler Durden, his life changes in many ways. He discovers his violent side, his willing to be free. Both create the ultimate therapy for people who can't find a meaning to their lives: The Fight Club. There men beat each other only to feel alive. Is this impossible? How many people enjoy boxing anyway? After the club becomes famous, though, Tyler starts to create something that will go out of control soon, and that will change that man's life forever. Fantastic dialogues. Amazing character development. A much better twist then 6th sense's. A flawless complex script. Very funny moments. Very tense moments. Nonsense. Insanity. Mischief. Mayhem. Soap. This movie really can rock your world. It made me feel much different about life itself, and is one of the best movies EVER. Highly recommended to anyone who likes to think. Edward Norton is amazing. Brad Pitt does his job well and David Fincher shows us once again that he has a great potential and must keep us addicted to his movies. A high praise to the guy who wrote the book as well. There is a guy who knows lots about humanity. 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523
"What is real and what is just perception?  The question sounds simple, but The Matrix spins complicated riddles of real world versus a computer generated one so convincingly that you'll find yourself thinking twice. It's a what-if action film that poses the reality that nothing we see, hear, taste, touch, smell and think are altogether real.  That human beings are blinded in ""the matrix"" - a dominating computer program that fools us into believing that this world exists.  Why you ask?  Well its simple.  Computers are evil and will do anything to take over the world.  This premise has been used effectively in the Terminator films, and goes further here by tricking the audience as well as the main character Neo, played by Keanu Reeves.  Neo begins his journey like the rest of us - ignorant to the truth.  He meets the leader of a small resistance and must make the choice: whether to live in a false world where computers secretly use human beings as energy sources, or to join the fight against this invisible tyranny.  This is a movie with incredible action sequences and ground-breaking special effects. Innovative camera angles and digital tinkering will leave you jaw dropped. The pace is very fast, and at times confusing.  The sinister ""agents"" are dark physical manifestations of the matrix, and persue Neo and his resistance group through a world that is unclearly real.  The out of this world action scenes confine themselves to the rules imposed by the far-fetched original concept.  This movie succeeds because of its frightening warning and foretelling of a possible computer controlled future.  There are a few strange and slow points in this film that leave unanswered questions.  How Neo can actually defeat an indestructable computer generated agent by simply flying into him is beyond me.  What baring did the oracle have on anything?  How did Morpheus manage to dodge the hundreds of gatling gun bullets?  What is so good about Neo and company killing ignorant and  innocent people under the spell of the matrix rather than rescuing them?  I guess we are not supposed to ask these questions of a movie based on a comic book.  These small points of contention can be overlooked for the nicely delivered bigger picture.  The Matrix is a great film.  Final Rating = 8.2/10",negative,2,tt0133093

"Let's get started. I'm not going to compare Infinity War to any other film. This is just a review of Infinity War itself. In Avengers Infinity War, the Avengers unite to protect the powerful Infinity Stones from the mass murderer Thanos who seeks to destroy half the life in the universe to restore ""ultimate balance"" to the universe so suffering may cease. That seems like a good idea, and it's actually a fairly classic superhero plot. The problem is is that it's exaggerated to a point where you have to believe in fantasies of a whole new degree. I mean come on, how old is the idea of half the life in the universe disappearing? To me it's way too kiddish and cheesy. But let's get started on what I like about Infinity War. Infinity War takes the idea of uniting the Avengers beautifully and it leads up to a nice and ballsy ending. The CGI of Infinity War is quite spectacular and everything does look alien as it should. The native looks native and the alien looks alien. The battles are thrilling and the cinematography and special effects are off the roof. The acting is brilliant as well. Then why am I rating this movie a 7/10? Because it makes a good film to watch with friends and family. Not a film you'd want to watch on your own and that makes you feel more completed as a person. Infinity War felt like one of those action films you can watch as a high school or college student and enjoy thoroughly. I watched it recently with my friends and generally superhero movies were supposed to be like that. An enjoyable family friend experience. But nowadays, the meaning of superhero movies has changed into something different. Superhero movies aren't just about blockbuster action and thrilling special effects nowadays. Infinity War took the classic route to Superhero blockbuster action and I can say. We've had too much of it lately. It's not a movie I'd probably even thinking about watching alone at home or late at night in my room because it doesn't make you feel any different anyway beginning to end. Too many plotholes exist and lilttle character development take place. And PLOT and CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT are key to a spectacular movie. But I won't deny that I enjoyed it. I certainly did enjoy Infinity War, but I felt that it lacked in too many places. I'm saying this as a true movie head as I love films which touch the heart and have thrilling action. But Infinity War only has thrilling action. Nothing much else really. An incredibly thrilling movie to watch, but not a spectacular movie in any other aspect. It's a good movie to watch for the adrenaline and nothing else really. Comparing this to other cinemas, I'd have probably rated this movie a 6.8/10. This movie is a blockbuster movie and it wont retain it's place in time. That's my review.",negative,4,tt4154756
"Given its troubled production history, and the fact that Disney seem to be milking the Star Wars franchise for all its worth with little regard for the fans, I expected this to be a lot worse than it actually is. Not that the film is anything great, mind you (Rogue One remains the best of the recent Star Wars movies), but it delivers plenty of mindless slam-bang action, and little of the absurd nonsense that seriously marred The Last Jedi. Alden Ehrenreich takes on the role made famous by Harrison Ford, and does a reasonable job of it, maybe not with all of the cocky swagger of his predecessor, but certainly more than passable; likewise, Donald Glover makes for a likeable Lando Calrissian. I wish I could say the same for Emilia Clarke as Han's love interest Qi'ra, but she is even less tolerable than Daisy Ridley (and that takes some doing). As expected, the special effects driven scenes are jaw-dropping, with a heist on a speeding mono-rail train thingy being the action highlight (which unfortunately comes too early, meaning that the rest of the film can only be considered a slight disappointment by comparison). On the more negative side is Lando Calrissian's female droid L3-37, an irritating concession to political correctness, a metal SJW who fights for rights of droids. All told, Solo is a mixed bag of good, bad and mediocre that, under different circumstances, might have been much better. But at least it's not The Last Jedi. 6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for the fun scene where Han meets Chewie for the first time.",neutral,5,tt3778644

"When I first saw Fight Club, it blew me away; I absolutely ate it up.  The film itself is superbly acted, well written (screenplay as well as original novel), and masterfully directed, with exceptionally skillful and subtle use of special effects.  One can really tell that this movie was a labor of love for everyone involved, from David Fincher to Rhett Wooden.* More than this, though, it was the message that got to me.  This movie in no small part led to a drastic shift in my personal outlook on life and my critical perspective.  I became highly sensitive to - and critical of - uncontrolled consumerism, individual insulation, and media manipulation, among other things.  I can honestly say that this movie helped change my life. After time and subsequent viewings, however, I have become more critical of Fight Club.  Isn't Tyler Durden - and thus, through his less-than-subtle preachiness, the movie itself - practicing the same force-feeding of ideology on Ed Norton's narrator and his ""space monkeys"" that he spends the whole movie railing against?  Isn't this movie, as a prepackaged, glitzy media spectacle, just another element of the mass media fixation and dependency that the narrator is trying to escape?  Other critics have said as much, and denounced the movie for hypocrisy and didacticism. However, one ought to consider the idea that the medium itself is always a part of the message.  The movie itself hints at this, as Brad Pitt's mischievous character (think Puck meets Travis Bickle) splices pornographic images into movies even as the viewer sees images of Brad spliced into Fight Club occasionally.  Think the irony of Hollywood Hunk Brad Pitt cast as the character who proclaims, ""We're all brought up to believe that we'll be movie gods and rock stars, but we won't,"" is accidental? If someone watches Fight Club and latches on to the message with intensity, like I did, then obviously that person needed to hear what Tyler Durden had to say, and had to hear it from Brad Pitt's famous & attractive mouth. Conversely, if someone watches Fight Club and is able to say ""that movie, while nicely executed, is overly preachy and hypocritical in its stated purpose,"" then that someone is independent enough of media not to need the media/cultural liberation that Fight Club preaches. That's what Fight Club's about, really - breaking free from cultural restraint of all kinds, even the restraints that allowed the genesis of that freedom.  It's about questioning everything - especially ads, magazines, TV, and - you guessed it - big-budget movies that tell you how to live your life.  So, while I've become more critical of Fight Club than I was originally, I only respect the movie that much more for its ability to subject itself to the same scrutiny it gives everything else. For these reasons and more, Fight Club is one of the best movies of the decade, and may well prove to be one of the defining movies of our generation, like The Graduate for the 60s and Saturday Night Fever for the 70s. I highly recommend consumption of Fight Club in any form, although this is one rare instance where I think film is the better-suited medium over print. I do have a beef with the movie's adaptation of the ending (considerably happier than the novel's), but that just enforces the idea that the movie itself isn't free from the trappings of Hollywood. The DVD is especially high-quality, with insightful commentary from the novelist, screenwriter, director, and main players (notably film buff Norton). 9.5/10 *David Fincher is the director.  Rhett Woodon is the best boy grip.  In Fight Club, everyone has a name.",neutral,5,tt0137523
"As mentioned above three legendary artists reuniting for a legendary character like Batman is more than just amazing.

I didn't see the sequel yet but since its the #1 at IMDb, i have no doubts that its gonna be the best movie of the year.

"You'll never get to watch such a brilliant piece of work. The first thought that occurred to me was ""Christopher Nolan is a psychic"". I felt that he must have peeped into the dreams of at least a 100 people. I found the plot similar to Matrix and also to Push. Yet it is presented with utmost care in a very intuitive but articulate manner. After all what else can you expect from the maker of The Dark Night,Prestige,Memento? The answer is ""Something more than an Excellent Screenplay"". After reading the reviews and looking at the 9.6/10 for the Premier shows, I've been eagerly waiting for the official release. I grabbed a ticket for the first show. I'd expected a movie of Level 5 (Prestige was the best movie previously Rated 5/5) but I got a Level 7 (7/5). The plot of the story appears to be simple : Cobb(Di Caprio) does the job of extracting confidential information from the business tycoons until one day when he finds himself all alone separated from his family. He then get an opportunity to get back most of his lost possessions. This time his job is not to extract the information but to insert it.

"I believed all the hype when The Fast and the Furious first came out as everybody was talking about how awesome the movie was. Upon hiring this out on video I felt totally cheated. The Fast and the Furious is one of the most overrated and over-hyped movies I have ever seen. As far as I'm concerned this is just brainless, action packed, testosterone fueled eye candy designed to attract teenagers who need lessons in how to act cool. Following the total disappointment of The Fast and the Furious, I vowed never to watch any of the sequels. If you have seen Point Break (a far more enjoyable movie), you get the idea of what the whole movie is about. Basically it is about a police officer played by Paul Walker (for a police officer in his late 20's, he behaves like a teenager who is too cool for school) who goes undercover to infiltrate the illegal street racing scene in order to investigate a series of hijackings led by Vin Diesel, who is the leader of the street gang responsible for the hijackings as well as the undisputed king of the street racing scene. The rest of the characters are nothing more than one dimensional testosterone filled, swaggering gangster show offs and super sexy bad girls. The Fast and the Furious is peppered with many lame one liners. ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time"", takes the cake as one of the worst one liners. Although The Fast and The Furious is still a popular movie with a large fan base, there is very little to like about this overrated, brainless and over-hyped rubbish.

"Do you remember the classic Star Wars? The times where we had to wait three years before we would get a new movie, the anticipation for The Force Awakens, the excitement of getting a new trilogy,...yes I miss those days. I really like this series, I wouldn't say I'm a die hard fan but I have seen all the movies multiple times and don't really think one of them is bad, of course I do think one is better than the other. When Disney took over, I was just curious. I was a little mixed when I first saw The Force Awakens, having a hugely different tone than the original saga. I found Rogue One to be incredibly dissapointing (there I said it) and The Last Jedi is one of the most conflicted movies I have ever seen in my life (I loved some aspects, I hated other ones). Now we are having a new Star Wars movie every year and I do have to say, the magic is gone. What used to be such hyped and beloved movies are now just products coming from a conveyor belt with no magic left in them. But who are we kidding? I'ts all about money isn't it? Okay that was my little rant on Disney's take on Star Wars, now on to the review. I had very low expectations for this movie. It's the second antalogy movie and the first one was pretty bad in my opinion. After seeing the movie I have to say...it's not that bad. There were more good things about this movie than I was expecting. First of all the acting is pretty good actually, yes say what you want about Han Solo in this movie but I actually liked him. The characters are all pretty good although some of them are pretty hollow. The blossoming relation between Han and Chewie is very well done, Lando is a likeable presence and some of the new characters are also very enjoyable. The effects of course are very good but what do you expect? I was also impressed by the cinematography, I really liked how the action scenes were filmed. Last but not least, there's also a secret cameo in the movie that was very satisfying to watch! All of these things being said, this movie doesn't really feel like it has an actual plot. We go from Han Solo meeting his future friends and receiving the Falcon etc, we all like and expect to see those things but it's all helmed like those are the only things they wanted to show us. I didn't feel like this was one big movie, but more like seperate setpieces tied togheter. They wanted to show how Han became the Han Solo we know, and they do that but a movie also needs a decent plot with a beginning, middle and end. Another thing is the villain, euhm I wouldn't know who the real villain is if you'd ask me. Yes there are bad guys but none of them feel like the main antagonist so that was pretty dissapointing. Some character arcs are also very unclear and leave me with a lot of questions. Last but not least, the movie also ends pretty abruptly, but that's a minor thing. Guys, in the end this isn't a bad movie. I am probably very unpopular when I say that I enjoyed this movie more than Rogue One, but still it just feels like a product coming from a conveyor belt...that's not what Star Wars is supposed to be... I give it a 7.2/10",negative,2,tt3778644

"Iv been told I have a high standard in movies, perhaps I do. But I guess when we are all treated to the cinematic prowess of Matrix 2 and 3, transformers 4 (but lets face it they all weren't that good going from ""ok sure' downward), pirates of the Caribbean 4, and even Jupiter ascending, that bar is set rather high. Hopefully that made my point. The opening scene goes into an elaborate, over the top CGI'ed battle, that 4 or 5 minutes in works out where it went wrong and tones it down. Only to have that whole story line completely disregarded aside from a small one line for the rest of the film I have never seen a good vs evil movie like this that I found myself rooting for the bad guy so much, as bad as the script writing for ultron was, James Spaders charisma still shone through and made me reminisce of better James Sader movies and TV series. Even the typical monologue stance of Alan Shaw was represented. However that is where the charisma halted. Also after an hour not sure who wouldn't be rooting for him to put us all out of our misery. A love story thrown in the middle of it makes us raise our eyebrows for a second before realising it was just piled on top and no thought put into it. The battle scenes seemed more like something out of transformers where metal smashing into metal we are expected to know what is going on and which chunk of metal is the good and bad. The one liners.. oh the one liners Everyone who loved the speedy kid in xmen days of future past got to see his twin European brother. The next avengers movie may work better as it might be the combination of the avengers and guardians of the galaxy, who I rate highly cause its like the creators know its not a serious movie, there is actual humour and characters you end up caring about cause its just good wholesome fun. The 2 reasons this didn't get a 1/10 is James Spader; and I have seen 15 minutes of another movie that easily outdoes this movie as worst movie ever made.

"The style and all the different changing styles that come and go are visually stunning. There was so much visual stuff going on at the same time, that it was overwhelming. Absolutely love the comic book style look of the movie. Great self-aware humor the way it makes fun of Spiderman 3. It's definitely a movie geared towards teens, but adults can enjoy it just the same. The soundtrack is great. I love how this movie has the opportunity to introduce younger kids to old school hip hop. It's a very fun, very entertaining movie with some really good ideas and concepts. It's a very fast-paced movie. I love when they introduce all the other Spider-man's. Spider-man Noir is one of the coolest concepts, I literally nerded out and yelled when they revealed him. Nic Cage as the voice is perfection. The movie's got a good sense of humor. The concept of the anime girl and Porker pig are too good. The action is exciting and really well animated. The movie taps into some unexpected emotional depth that left me teary eyed. The storytelling is really well done. The movie does a good job at highlighting how you shouldn't give up and keep trying. And how there's not only one iteration of a hero, there's hundreds. Really great movie! I'd watch it again. Raw score: 8.5/10.",neutral,5,tt4633694
"mild spoilers here regarding this movie and ""Strangers on a train"" and ""Psycho"" It alway bothers me when things in movies get too complicated and unrealistic. Maybe that's not the point if you are doing a ""comment on our society"" as someone stated here, but to me it matters when you are trying to do a crime mystery / thriller. I didn't get thrilled, so I did not like that movie. As Chandler wrote it in an essay, if you want to kill somebody, you don't train a snake to sneak into a closed chamber to bite the victim, you don't dress up in a costume (see Edgar Wallace), you don't invite ten people to a remote castle just to kill 'em one by one (Christie). No you simple ambush the victim and kill him in a dark back road or like Hitch did it in ""Strangers on a train"" on that island or the killing of Arbogast in Psycho (yes I know there was a dress involved). This movie was clearly made before C.S.I. hit the screen. Heck, this movie was made before they invented witnesses or anything else which would be a challenge to the killer, like being seen when he stalks his victims by a neighbor or something... He just enters the apartments of these people like he owns their places and then kills 'em in the most complicated way just to create the effect. And he gets away every time. He's a genius, he's better than Arsène Lupin, better even than Keyser Soze, better than the Joker, you name it. Make your comments on society and do a movie like ""American History X"". Make a thriller - do it Hitchcock-Chandler-style. But is it just me and old Raymond who prefer it that way?? 4/10 Macaulay J. Connor",negative,4,tt0114369
"So this is the breakout movie for Jason Statham and the first movie where he plays as the lead role. I didn't much think of this actor when this film first debuted. But he really built himself up to be one of the most well known action stars out there. I remember watching this movie as a kid and thought it was alright, maybe because I was a big Jet Li fan back then. Sure this film can be slightly corny in today's standards and the chase and action sequences are ridiculous. But a movie like this shouldn't be taken seriously. And it seems to get even more ridiculous and even more over the top with each installment. So the plot is about this guy named Frank Martin who is a Ex-Special Forces Operator and topnotch driver that transports people or objects from one destination to another for a fee. Even if the task is dangerous, so in a way he is a getaway driver. He has three rules. Rule One: Never change the deal. Rule Two: No names--Frank doesn't want to know whom he's working for, or what he's transporting. Rule Three: never look in the package. The last two rules puts him at a disadvantage in my opinion, especially since he works for dangerous guys. From the dialogue to the anti-hero to bad guys interactions is very cliché, but it's one of those action movies that because of the simple and yet fun action sequences. Even if the characters directions and decisions doesn't make much sense either. Mainly because it doesn't try to be more than what it is, while it having effort and well choreographed sequences in it mixed in with humor. This is a cool (although a bit corny now) and stylish action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. So overall, this movie despite the mediocre character development and story it connects well enough with the cool action sequences to make it worth a rental and made it worth a watch in the theaters when it came out. 7.1/10",negative,1,tt0293662
"I honestly don't know how anyone could possibly not love this movie, much less despise it. The director obviously took for granted that everyone who decided to view the film would have some intelligence and he wouldn't have to spend an unnecessary amount of time explaining why characters are the way they are or do the things they do. A back story is not the directors responsibility in a freaking sequel. As for the characters being prone to having very involved and seemingly impossible plans that revolve around knowledge that you think they probably don't have, I have two responses. There is a reason that the movie is even made. First of all, the people in it are not real and therefore are not subjected to limits of normal reality. There are countless things that happen in movies that probably shouldn't happen, but there are maybe even more things that happen in real life that shouldn't happen... Who made you the judge of the probabilities of fictional occurrences? Secondly, the reason that a story is being told about people is not because they are normal. The reason they are characters in a movie is because they are exceptional and are not limited to the normal standards of behavior of normal people and can sometimes do surprising things that ordinary people can't do. This tends to be the case with a great deal of movies, and is especially common in SUPERHERO MOVIES!!! The point of the entire genre is that we know this stuff can't really happen. You don't have to explain individual circumstances that can't happen and support your claims with your limitless knowledge of the laws of physics and probabilities of fictional worlds. We get it, you know everything that could ever happen and ever has happened and something happened in the movie that couldn't have happened so it's a bad movie. Brilliant!!! And if you thought the movie was too long, then you are an idiot. And I'm not arguing with you whether the movie was actually too long or not. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't... I personally could have watched it a lot longer than 2.5 hours. There is this mystical thing you can do before you go see a movie... it's called CHECK HOW LONG THE MOVIE IS. If you don't want to watch a two and a half hour movie, than don't go to a movie that lasts two and a half hours. And if you don't want to but do anyway, then don't complain about it because there is no excuse and it's your own fault. And while Maggie Gyllenhaal may not be the most attractive woman they could have cast for the role of Rachel Dawes, maybe Batman and Harvey Dent just aren't as superficial as everyone who finds the movie flawed because Batman values character over appearance. And I read a comment that complained about the Joker being too serious and violent. There is a reason the Joker is Batman's arch-nemesis. He is a psychopathic, homicidal, ruthless murderer with no morals or values whatsoever, the exact opposite of Batman in every way. To think he goes around committing ""prankish"" crimes and is an all around funny guy is naive and missing the point. And if I hear one more person complain about Batman's voice I am going to shoot myself. This isn't like Spiderman where he can talk to people he knows in his normal voice and people still won't figure out who he is, or worse, Superman when he just puts on some glasses. You can see half of Batman's face even with his mask on, do you not think it would help to hide his true identity if he didn't use his normal voice when speaking? I MEAN COME ON!!! Is it that hard to understand? People are really reaching for complaints about this movie. ""WAHHH, ITS TOO DARK...WAHHH"". Well, I believe Gotham City is kind of recognized as a dark place with a lot of crime and darkness. It kind of plays in to the overall setting and subsequently affects the quality of the film. In the 90's, the fantasy Batman films were fine. But now that I've seen this much realism with the last two Batman movies, I can't go back to the phony, almost comedic interpretations of what was meant to be somewhat serious struggles between good and evil. I can't and I won't, and what's more, I won't stand idly by while someone is complaining about the best thing to ever happen to not only Batman, but possibly the superhero genre as a whole. Do you have any idea the kind of quality movies we are going to get now, people following The Dark Knight's example, trying to compete with it, and so on? Do you realize that this movie has made over 22 million dollars, ON A TUESDAY!!! It's been out a week now, and is already in the top 50 grossing movies of ALL TIME. I mean, could it be that 99% of the world is wrong about this movie and it's actually garbage? I mean really, what's next. ""I didn't see Bruce Wayne sleeping in the film. People have to sleep to live. It's not realistic...drrr"" ""WAHHH, its a crime fighting movie with a superhero and villains but there's fighting in it and its violent fighting...WAHHH"" Oh, actually some people really do have that complaint. I personally find it laughable, as well as anyone else who doesn't give this movie at least a 9/10.",positive,9,tt0468569

The letdown was so monumental as I was left scratching my head at the dichotomy between such exhuberant online praise and what I was actually experiencing. The acting is actually pretty bad in this, and that's just for starters what stands out the most. It can be even cringeworthy at times. The drama that the writers are going for at first seems effective, but as the story unfolds, you begin to see that it's not working. The special effects are undeniably good, and that's where my 4 stars comes from (about the only thing).

"I bought The Godfather: The Game and was sucked so deeply into it that I wanted to see the movies. My brother kept telling me about how the scenes in the movie played out and that alone was enough to make me buy the entire collection on DVD. I will never regret that decision so long as I live. The Godfather plays out like a documentary with out the corny voice over. The actors in this movie do such a great job it feels as though you aren't watching a movie but are instead watching the individual lives play out. There isn't a plot that can be fingered out. If you had to it would be the war between all the families and the cause of it. Don Vito Corleone is approached by a member of the Tattaglia family to form a deal between the two families in a new business venture: the selling of drugs. Don Corleone, a vigilant believer in the old ways, feels that getting into the business of drugs will draw too much heat. And because of this he refuses the offer that is placed before him. This fuels a fire with the Tattaglia family and it has a domino effect that causes wars between all of the families. The movie revolves around this central premise and comes to a head with the ending of the war. The outcome and what ends the war is also unpredictable and full of strategic writing. And I feel that the ending will surprise any body who doesn't already know how it all does. The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is because although it is a very entertaining and among the best movies I've ever seen, I don't feel that it is THEE best. There are movies out there that will entertain all audiences and that are just as good. There are movies that I can watch with friends without them growing bored. It gets a 9 because, as much as I love this movie, I can admit that it will only entertain a certain kind of person. I know there are movies that don't have this restriction. A definite must buy for collectors; Make sure you like dramatic movies and not action movies though.",positive,10,tt0068646
"The Wolf of Wall Street is Martin Scorsese unleashed - a three-hour whirlwind of sex, drugs, money, and moral collapse, fueled by a career-high performance from Leonardo DiCaprio. As Jordan Belfort, DiCaprio is electric: charming, disgusting, hilarious, and impossible to look away from. The film doesn't just show you the rise and fall of a corrupt stockbroker - it immerses you in the madness, daring you to enjoy the ride even as it spirals into total chaos. From the infamous quaalude crawl to the yacht scenes to motivational speeches that sound like sermons to the damned, Scorsese makes excess feel exhilarating and exhausting all at once. Jonah Hill is a revelation as Donnie Azoff, bringing wild unpredictability and razor-sharp timing. The supporting cast is stacked, the editing (by Thelma Schoonmaker) is kinetic, and the use of voiceover narration is classic Scorsese - self-aware, confessional, and dripping with irony. But what holds it back slightly is that its relentless energy can also be overwhelming. The film walks a fine line between satirizing and glorifying its subject - and while the message is clear to many, some viewers may miss the deeper critique beneath the coke-fueled chaos. 8.5/10 - a riotous, jaw-dropping rollercoaster of greed and depravity, led by a director and actor firing on all cylinders. It's not just a movie - it's a three-hour high, and like most highs, it eventually comes crashing down.",neutral,5,tt0993846
"Let's start with Batman's last line ""You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain"". This movie is surely the best of the year so far and deservedly so.

The direction is superb as well is the acting by whole cast, even the small characters of Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are very well dealt with. But the most important person who steals the show is one and truly MR.Heath Ledger; even Batman looks a bit frightened by him(look at the eyes of batman when he interacts with joker in cell). This is easily the best batman movie and way better than ""Begins"". So i'll just say watch it even if u are not familiar with batman franchise.

While Batman must must endure the psychological horror that the Joker puts him through. Action: 9.6/10 The hand to hand combat is pretty good but this movie shines on its set pieces, especially the car chasing sequences that's where this movie peaks for its action. Acting: 9.5/10 Yes Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all time as the Joker everyone knows that. I really do want to shoutout Aaron Eckhart for his amazing performance as Harvey Dent and 2 face and Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordon. Christian Bale gives me probably my favorite Bruce Wayne performance. While everyone else in the movie ranges to very good to good. Cinematography: 9.5/10 This movie has a lot of big set pieces that are shot extremely beautifully. To me though this movie is shot the best when it's two characters talking together especially the Batman and Joker interrogation scene. Overall a masterfully shot film. Affects: 9.6/10 Christopher Nolan uses CGI very sparingly in all his films but when he does it usually looks great. Where this movie shines is the set pieces that all use practical effects that look amazing every time. Musical Score: 9.8/10 Possibly one of my favorite scores in a movie of all time. Filled with grand orchestral sets and heavy drums the music in this film makes you feel every emotion in its scenes and captures the perfect balance of hope and despair. Replay ability: 9.9/10 Quite easily has had one of the best replay ability than most films. This movie has never bored me or over stayed it's welcome.

It is witty with its one liners, it is jaw-dropping with its visuals and action sequences and is awesome because we get to see new Avengers (Vision, Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver etc.), Hulk vs. Hulkbuster, a villain who is just as good as Loki and a team fighting together with no boring bits or overrated scenes, like in the first Avengers movie. Those who disagree with me are spoiled fan boy haters who cannot see greatness in front of them. It is tied with the first Avengers movie as my favorite MCU movie and tied as my favorite movie of 2015 with Mad Max: Fury Road. I disagree with IMDb and believe that this movie is at least 8.2/10.

"Home Alone is a holiday classic from a simpler time. Back when cheesiness was normal and nauseating wholesomeness was all the rage, Home Alone excelled. The film's massive success is both obvious and perplexing because it is as safe as possible. Empty familial platitudes and buffoonish threats give the illusion of a journey without challenging audiences. It's warm, cozy, and topped off with cartoonish violence. What did Kevin and his family really learn? Will Kevin continue to be neglected? Did any character actually arc? Despite wanting to buy into the sentimentality, some viewers might find Home Alone hollow. These feelings extend to the actual filmmaking of Home Alone as well. The cinematography throws in some shadows, POVs, and framing, but the visuals are mostly rudimentary. The same goes for the editing, production, and sound, all of which rarely enhance the experience. The effects are memorable but fairly simple, and the direction is cohesive but generic. Undoubtedly, the music is the greatest strength of Home Alone because it carries all the emotional weight that the film is selling. Ultimately, Home Alone is an adequate movie that broke through as an icon. Writing: 6/10

"There is not really any reasonable explanation why there are so many junk movies with ratings over 8 in IMDb except the fact that unfortunately we are living in the age of materialism and total commercialism. Before mentioning anything about The Dark Knight itself I should point out that the movie business started as an experiment and furthermore, it was (and I hope it still is) art. If you are a part of the lucky people that had the chance to watch old movies (starting from the early 1900s) then you probably have noticed that despite the bad quality the technique and the style of directing, cinematography, acting and ""special effects"" are fascinating. They are modern, sincere, effective, touching. That's where art starts and flourishes. However, if you take all the pointed out and replace them with high quality computer effects, deafening soundtrack, good looking actors, banal plot and the appealing to the masses simple conflict of Good vs Bad; well, here is where commercialism begins its unstoppable brainwashing system. The Dark Knight fits exactly the formula. Nothing more to say. To those who agree: There are still some great new movies coming out. It just takes time to find them. Don't be discouraged by the overwhelming amount of junk films. To those who disagree: Well, consider watching Casablanca, Silence of the Lambs, Amadeus, Star Wars :p, etc? To those who don't take a side: Now is the time to do so. To Heath Ledger: You were just great and sorry to know this was the last time to see you. [17 June 2009] Later ... Here now as I watched the film for a second time so that I would be entirely fair in my judgment I realized that 8/10 is a fair rating BUT and only BUT when The Dark Knight is rated on a different scale such as ""Top movies based on a comics"". And what is a comics other than a combination of a simple plot, good vs evil, black and white characters, lots of action? The end. When a movie has nothing more to add - no fair character development/acting, no original twists in the chain of events, no unique directing techniques... then one cannot give it more than 5/10.

"it's came out in 1994 and was an absolute flop but found its real audience in home video, peaking as the most rented video of 1995 in the USA. A wonderful film that takes you into the prison experience of Red(Morgan Freeman) and Andy (Tim Robbins). Andy being a banker convicted of murder and Red a murderer already serving time, this movie takes you to the limits of human endurance, where the human spirit eventually prevails. The TSR takes you on an emotional journey that you will remember for a long time, thanks to the superb crafting of the film and sincere performances by the cast. The score is deep and haunting, this film is for the ages and will permanent have a place in my heart. To me it is the best film of the 90's and quite possibly one of the best of all time. The fact that this film is sitting at No.1 is a testament to just how many people love this film, many viewers seem to have an emotional bond with the film, and I don't blame them. I only wish that I could view the film for the first time again, and experience that redeeming feeling Andy and Red experienced at the end.

"Wow! the expectations I had on this movie was huge. Did it deliver ohh yes... The movie is darker cooler funnier and more action packed then Fotr. but maybe not really as good as a movie. The last one I thought was complete without a single flaw except maybe to little action. TTT has a 15 min slow part with Arwen and Aragorn that is pretty boring and It feels a little that that fellowship didn´t get anywhere in the story. I also felt that it could have been longer that some scenes and explanation to things were way to short. But all this is small problems compared to the experience you get from the movie. The special effects and acting and the music and scenery everything is top notch and you can really feel the love Peter jackson has for the material. The battle at helms deep is unlike anything you have ever seen before just so stong and impressive. the part where Legolas glides down the stairs in a shield and at the same time shooting arrows is one of the best and coolest moments in movie history. George Lucas should learn a bit about film making from peter. Gollum so good is he that a can`t describe it with words. TTT is not a perfect movie with the most intellectual story and there are a lot of better movies out there but it so exciting well written well made and entertaining that I almost could cry. Especially the trio of Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn has everything. Fellowship,humor, action and I love the way they speak this epic language which just sounds so cool and evolving. Go and see this movie and the first one. When the third comes out you should see all three in a row cause this is basicly one big adventure divided into three it is meant as on 10 hour movie.

What is does have is some brilliant acting, a hard-nosed look at the reality of the every day average blue collar American, and redefines the meaning of mentally insane. This movie stands on the edge and creates a new genre for itself. The script is crafted spectacularly and the plot is so interesting, you will have trouble pausing it for a quick bathroom break.

"Simply dumbstruck an no wonder why this movie tops the IMDb List for these long years. Its simple awesome to look at the simplicity and the screen play. The best casting and acting. At some point of time I started to look around and realized that I am still at my home. No odd scenes, dialog, character).. My only concern is why its 9.2/10 ( why is the remaining(.8)% of people voted below 10?, because they are called as Morons....The best part is that, the director or the film crew is not so greedy to shoot a prequel or sequel after the massive success of this film. Hats off, and that is the real victory of the movie. This is my first review and I am forced to write 10 Lines of text.Sorry guys!!",negative,2,tt0111161
"When even the usual obnoxious, jump-scare-hopeful teenagers are falling asleep at a film for their own demographic, you know the movie is bad. Not only is the new version of 'The Grudge' incredibly unnecessary, but it's painfully boring. It gives the audience nothing to root for, nothing to connect with, nothing exciting or memorable. There's comedic bad, and then there's boring bad. Sitting through this film was excruciating, and I can't find anything truly redeemable to warrant giving it more than 1/10 stars. Lin Shaye played her part well, and the rest of the cast was okay - especially considering how empty and hollow the material felt - but even so, this movie isn't worth giving any of your time or earnings to.",negative,1,tt3612126
"Oh my god! Current rating 8.7 and # 28 on top 250 list...!! I think many of IMDb users have gone out of their mind to vote 10, 9 & 8 to such a ridiculous crap. Yes, it is a fact that i do believe in the voting system of IMDb and it is absolutely true that i consult the reviews of this site before watching most of the films. In 95% of cases my judgment gone true. On the basis of rating and reviews i got disappointed only with two films. One is Se7en and the other is Once upon a time in the West (1968). Some of the IMDb users are also claiming Se7en to be the best work of David Fincher till date. But i don't think so... Fight Club (1999) is the best work of Fincher till date. It doesn't matter to me what others think about this review of mine but this is not a classic to be rated so high. ""The god inspired and ordered a person to eliminate those 7 people who are indulging themselves to the 7 deadly sins of the universe."" I do admire the insane attitude of the killer but the plot and the entire story was full of flaws. Like in most of the psychological thrillers here also the lead actors failed to read and analyze the mind of the killer. In every crime committed by the killer... he stayed two steps ahead of the detectives. And yes the climax itself was one of the worst i have ever seen. Watch it only if you are a strong fan of crime thrillers otherwise not! Self - interpretation by the viewer after watching the film is the most important thing... 4/10....I can't vote it more than that..",negative,4,tt0114369

"Based on R2 DVD 134 min. I must confess this movie left me with a sense of 'why the hell was that about?'. None the less it is engrossing and enjoyable while it runs through its two and a quarter hours of mayhem, madness, some rather gruesome violence and brief pornographic moments. It would have been nice had the movie stayed a little closer to story setup in the first half hour, which played a little more intelligently then the story that finally unfolded. 6/10 worth watching.",neutral,6,tt0137523
"The main reasons that I wanted to go and see this movie were that I enjoyed Batman Begins and that I wanted to see for myself if Heath Ledger is as good as everyone was saying he is.Well I can safely say that i wasn't disappointed with the outcome of this movie. The Dark Knight is probably the best superhero movie that I have ever seen.It is also the only sequel that i've liked better then the original.Christopher Nolan has delivered everything in this movie.The special effects,the set design,the costumes,everything was superb.The acting provided the other half of this brilliant film.Gary Oldman,Aaron Eckhart,Maggie Gyllenhaal,Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were all outstanding in their respective roles.But by far,the main standouts in this movie were Christian Bale and Heath Ledger. Bale was again oustanding as the Bat.You can certainly see that he has improved from Batman Begins even though he was good in that to.Bale's performance as Batman makes Michael Keaton,Val Kilmer, and George Clooney's portrayals as Batman look like a joke. I could probably talk for a whole hour about Heath Ledger.His performance as the Joker had everyone laughing,gasping and looking on in horror at the same time.Ledger's last appearance has certainly stunned everyone.Being able to laugh like he did was a supreme effort.I can see why people are saying that he deserves an Oscar for this role.Besides Bale,he outshone everyone else. The Dark Knight is by far,the best movie of 2008 so far.It is definitely a mustsee for Batman and non-Batman fans alike. 10/10",positive,10,tt0468569
"What happens when one of cinema's most iconic rogues is given an origin story that seeks to explain his charm, skills, and scars? Solo aims to flesh out the early years of Han Solo with energy and polish, but its safe execution leaves it more serviceable than daring. Alden Ehrenreich takes on the daunting task of portraying young Han. While he avoids outright imitation of Harrison Ford, his performance effectively captures Han's mix of swagger and vulnerability, although it takes time to gel fully. Emilia Clarke as Qi'ra brings intrigue and complexity, although her arc is only partially explored. Donald Glover's Lando Calrissian is the film's standout, exuding effortless charisma and stealing every scene he appears in. The film succeeds in world-building, showing the gritty underbelly of the galaxy: criminal syndicates, high-stakes heists, and a sense of frontier adventure. The Kessel Run sequence offers one of the most exciting set pieces, blending tension with visual spectacle. Howard keeps the pacing brisk, though the script often feels too focused on ticking boxes-explaining Han's blaster, his name, and his partnership with Chewbacca-rather than letting the story breathe organically. Visually, the muted cinematography occasionally mutes the film's sense of fun, while the narrative rarely takes risks beyond fan service. Still, as a lighthearted space adventure, it delivers entertainment and expands the saga's lore. Rating: 6/10 - Solo provides a competent and occasionally thrilling origin tale with standout performances, but its cautious storytelling keeps it from soaring beyond adequate.",neutral,6,tt3778644
"Never have I ever watched a bad film that drags as much as this did at the run time of 1 hour and 30 mins. This film is a great example of terrible pacing and piss poor storytelling. It's nothing but a cash grab marketed as a new vision for the original Grudge series because trust me, there's nothing new here. It's like they forgot what made the original ones so scary in the first place. It feels like this was a horror film that was made for someone who has never watched a horror film in their life and I bet even those people will not find this amusing. The best part of this franchise - Kayako's ghost from original Grudge series is missing from this movie save for one scene? And the ghosts that are present in this movie's cheap jump scares and horribly edited ""scary scenes"" have extremely generic designs that you would see in any low budget horror film. I literally laughed out loud at times because of how ridiculous some of those scenes were. There are no character arcs here and the film is trying to be much smarter than it actually is and the director is just exercising in how good of a shot he can take with perfect lighting and composition but there's nothing of actual substance in this movie. It literally gives away the whole story in it's opening credits and then pretends you don't know anything and tells you the same predictable story at a turtle's pace. It's a snoozefest. I was just waiting for it to be over so I can give it a 2/10 rating. Easily one of the worst horror films I have ever seen and maybe even one of the worst films I have ever seen? TRUST ME, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS FILM.",negative,2,tt3612126
"Around 11 years since this film was premiered and it's still one of the best superhero movies I've ever watched. This film far exceeds my expectations. Story is great. Music is outstanding. Acting is perfect.
Christian Bale made Batman a solemn, mysterious superhero. His Batman is less fictional than the older version. Then he had to confront Joker, played by Hedge Ledger who was awarded Oscar for this performance. His acting is stunning. He portrayed Joker as an insane villain who was Batman's the most dangerous rival. His joker didn't seem like it was an acting. Comparing to other Joker performance, Ledger's version is the greatest without questions. Aaron and Maggie also did a great job in this movie.
Nolan's films never disappoint me. The story got deeper and darker which can hold me form the beginning until the end. He blended everything beautifully. Stunning screenplay also convinced me to stay focus what will happened next in the film.
Another thing that impresses me so much is soundtracks composed by Hans Zimmer. Music pieces in the film are full of musicality. They can profoundly reflect emotions. In my opinion, Batman soundtrack is one of the best movie soundtracks.
There are a lot of things to talk about this movie. But in an nutshell, this movie is worth 2 hours to watch. I hope that in the future, Nolan and his colleagues will bring us some more unforgettable masterpieces like The Dark Knight. For me, this movie gets 10/10 Without hesitation.",positive,10,tt0468569
"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, That have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now. True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be. The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate. Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it. The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated. In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating.",positive,10,tt0068646
"I first watched Memento in late June. I really liked it. But I couldn't grasp the words to describe it. Memento belongs to the category of film I call ""Cannot comprehend with one viewing"". So here I am, the last day of summer after seeing it again, and now I can. Memento is incredible. It has to be the most small-scale mystery-crime-thriller I've seen, with a total of 3 major characters, but it's quietly brilliant. If it was a normal film, told front to back, it would be above average, but only just. Luckily it's not. The best part of Memento, the thing that makes it stand out, is it's format. When you first watch, it takes a while for anything to start making sense, and it actually hurt my head trying to figure out the timeframe. I won't say how it plays out, but it's outstandingly unique. And for some reason, like the protagonist Leonard, you can't remember what just happened. Even now, I totally forget the beginning- wait the end- no, the beginning of the film. I just can't remember. A special note- the opening credits are the best part of the film. When you catch on to what's happening, you'll gasp. It's explosive and brilliant. The three main characters are excellent. They are layered, well- played, and keep you guessing. Leonard is our protagonist, played by Guy Pearce in a big change from his other major role in L.A. Confidential. He cannot make new memories, which is why the film is presented so uniquely. He is generally disciplined, and conflicted about everything not tattooed to his body or in his photos. Guy Pearce is excellent as this walking uncertainty. His narrations are blank, like his general perception. It helps that he just looks the part. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are excellent as Natalie and Teddy, the support who aren't what they seem to appear to look like. Sound confusing? It is, until we find out more and more about them. Their personalities- or what they look like- are really good. Another note- music is minimal, but great. It really captures the small scope, while being stirring. The plot is good, but is much better because of the presentation and editing that keeps the scenes from looking choppy. There's a neat twist that changes our perspective, and Memento simply has to be seen again or you'll miss out on key things. Also, you'll totally forget your first viewing. One last note- it's really cool when the film changes from black and white to colour. Leaonard literally shakes colour into the film. In short you have to see this. It's original and unique, presented very well, and offers an intriguing tale from a cool perspective. I could easily see someone saying this is their favourite film ever. I could even be yours. 9.2/10",negative,2,tt0209144
"Whenever I see a film, I almost always walk into the cinemas with hopes that the movie is going to be good so I don't feel that I wasted money on it. I go to see almost every movie that is based on a comic book, because I happen to be a big fan of comic books. It's very rare that I am deeply disappointed after walking out of a movie, but this is an unfortunate exception. To begin with, this movie is not called Bruce Wayne Begins. The focus on Batman is too low, as you hardly ever see Wayne in his costume. It isn't even until more than halfway through the movie that you first see him as Batman. I understand that this movie is supposed to inform you of Bruce Wayne's background, which is something that the other four movies failed to do, but the focus on him is just ridiculous. I was very bored throughout much of the movie, because of how slow-paced and centralized on Wayne it is. The only performance that I was vehemently impressed with was Cillain Murphy's part as The Scarecrow. For the first time in a Batman movie, the villain actually is frightening. However, he had no reasonable motive for his actions, and neither did Bruce Wayne's teacher. For all of you that are expecting to see this movie and walk out of it with a feeling of positive astonishment and satisfaction, don't waste your money or time on it, unless you're a Batman fan. Big fans of the Dark Knight may find this movie enjoyable, as you finally get to discover Batman's origin and Bruce Wayne's motivation. However, I am not a major fan of Batman, and I feel that this movie is too deeply involved with Bruce Wayne and not involved enough with Batman. 5/10",neutral,5,tt0372784
"Fight Club is one of the greatest movies movies of all time... through the first 110 minutes. The film is about a man who has become a corporate slave, he sees no value or meaning in his life anymore. Because of this he goes to support groups in hopes that the pain of others will enable him to feel something, anything at all. The movie lays out a story that is entirely believable, considering people's tendencies of overworking, and the isolation many people feel in this modern world. Perhaps in the not-so-distant future people will feel the need to beat the hell out of each other to feel alive and connected. So far, in the film, you have grown attached to the characters and are immersed in the reality of what could be. The ending, ah the ending. The first 110 minutes of this movie are rated a 10/10 in my book, the last half hour or so brings the final rating down three points. The ending fit perfectly into a movie that was science fiction based. However this doesn't work. This movie bases its entire story around the idea that this kind of thing could really happen. The ending throws everything out the window. By the time this movie is over you might feel cheated, and rightfully so. To have science fiction like ending to this movie is almost as bad as making an entire movie a dream, you cannot do it! Salpping that ending onto this movie makes the entire thing feel pretentious and phony. Many will tell you that this is not the case, and that I just don't appreciate the twist at the end. To formulate your own opinion, well you will just have to watch this for yourself. Good luck and, please, give me some feedback.",positive,10,tt0137523
"This is perhaps one of the best movies I have ever seen and no doubt the best of Stephen King. Director Frank Darabont created a masterpiece. It is a very intelligent story telling us how hard prison life can be. It critics the judgements of innocent prisoners. But the most I liked is that every time there is another interesting story that develops in this prison. At the last third of the movie we can enjoy the big surprise or the dessert. This novel is very nice told and it merits standing ovation. I and my wife rarely see such films. This is quality of film making and today where we are?   8.5/10.

"The Shawshank Redemption is a well-made, respectful film with strong performances and a meaningful message about hope. I understand why many people like it. However, I did not feel the overwhelming emotional impact that its reputation promises. The story is calm, slow, and carefully told, but it never reached the level of intensity people describe as ""life-changing."" What honestly hurts the experience is the massive media hype and herd mentality around it. When a film is constantly labeled ""the best movie of all time,"" expectations become unfairly inflated. Many viewers seem to repeat this claim because it is socially accepted, not because they truly felt it that deeply. In my view, it is a good film, not a masterpiece.

This movie is the best movie of all time, only if The Sixth Sense is a comedy! As a normal citizen, I had to be ""very smart"" to get my tickets a few hours early, because the cinema was almost FULL! Well,that isn't weird considering of what people have been saying...""Best movie I ever saw!!!"" Luckily, I didn't await to be surprised by the movie, meaning I didn't await for it to be excellent...maybe good! And that was very smart again, because the movie would've been a disappointment otherwise. LOTR was more of a parody, than of a serious movie!

Smallest things.....money!

I don't want to be misunderstood...this movie wasn't that terrible...I surely went too far with the negative things, because so many said it was the best of all time...no.

"I have not read the book, and after watching the film, I am really not interested in giving one cent towards the ""Belfort Enterprise"".I am really not sure if the reason I constantly got irritated during the film, would be linked to the fact that I just cannot comprehend people to be as void of any moral compass as Belfort and his gang. This is probably why DiCaprio has been nominated for the Academy Award. His portrayal of this scum of the earth character is quite good, yet becomes quite predictable. The thing that really bothers me about the Wolf of Wallstreet, is that although there are some hints of ""regret and rehabilitation"" from Belfort's point of view, it does seem like it rather glorifies the sickening business of pump and dump trading, prostitutes, group sex, chauvinism, drug abuse and general hedonism. Although I don't have an issue per say with a hedonistic lifestyle, it is incomprehensible that someone who is entrusted with money from an already exploited public, could just throw it away with such ease and without remorse. This is maybe why the film is quite a love/hate spectacle. You get furious with all the role players in this fiasco, especially Belfort as the film aims to portray the life of a ruthless young man who only has money, drugs and sex on his brain, while dragging dozens of others down the drain with him At the end of the film, I had mixed feelings. I am sure that some of the scenes (for example the group sex and wild parties) were exaggerated either by Belfort himself or by the filmmakers. It really got a bit too much to see all these orgies, who I honestly believe is a figment of Belfort's imagination (or probably spiced up by the producers to make the film a bit more sensationalist). Where the film succeeds though is the fact that it leaves the viewer hating what these people have done. There is nothing noble about Belfort, his pump and dump operation, or the way that he managed to get a slap on the wrist.The Wolf of Wallstreet made sure that we gain an insight as to where we should not invest our hard earned cash, and that the aspiration to earn millions comes at a high moral price. At the end of the film, where Belfort appears at a Sales Conference in Auckland, I could only shake my head. There are some sins that should not be forgiven and some people that should never be trusted. This man is one of those that should be avoided at all cost. To any aspiring business professional that walked out of the film feeling some form of adoration for this man, do a quick reality check and think of the stories that were not told in the film. The story of all those hard working people that lost all of their money due to these buffoons and their aggressive sales pitches and unscrupulous business practices. Although the movie has moments of brilliance, the fact that it seems to try and portray Belfort as changed, and ignored the pain and suffering that his criminality brought to thousands of investors, left me a cold and annoyed. It seems like a glorified celebration of a wicked conman and his gang of useful idiots. This is why I can only score it a 4/10. Probably one of the most difficult material Scorsese had to work with, especially given that this is a first hand testimony of an egotistical narcissist who probably will do exactly the same thing again should he have another opportunity. Yes, the film probably made millions because of this controversy, but Scorsese and DiCaprio should have probably taken the moral high ground and avoided falling into the trap of celebrating this conman. For some odd reason I feel like they are now, partly involved in the con, which is a sad thing to say for such an accomplished actor and director.",negative,4,tt0993846
"R&B is not the sort of film I usually enjoy to watch...however, I have to admit that I kinda liked this movie. It has its ups and its downs but in the end, it was simply done for a few laughs. First the positives. Jason Alexander plays the role of Boris in such an exaggerated manner that its hilarious watching him act. He reminds me of that Russian voice you hear in Vodka commercials, only he's more retarded. De Niro does a surprisingly small role as the fearless leader. I guess we've seen him in so many serious films that we are not used to this level of mediocre acting from him. Nevertheless, he ends up being OK in the movie, not really getting in the way. Of course, there is the ever so awesome flying squirrel Rocky. He was always the best part of the show and even in this film coming off as a 3d character, he's still as furry and as lovable as in the original cartoon. Finally, a story line ripped of Roger Rabbit and a narrator which interacts with the characters bring a small smile from the audience. That smile however, is a result from the over retardness of this movie. I guess that was the biggest flaw in the film, it made so many bad jokes and had so many predictable gags that the retardness just got blown out of proportion. WAIT! NO! I take it back! the retardness was not the biggest flaw, i'll tell you what the biggest flaw in the movie (and the cartoon for that matter) is: BULLWINKLE. He is the most annoying, not funny, not cute, ugly, dumb, clueless character in the HISTORY of cartoons. His voice makes you want to hang a puppy and he is useless when it comes to solving problems. If they would have killed him at the start of the movie, it would have been a good movie, instead, its a mediocre movie. Drop dead you LSD addict moose. 5/10 P.S.

"I'm a big Christopher Nolan fan (loved Memento and The Prestige) and a big Martin Scorsese fan (loved Taxi Driver and The Departed), so no bias here. I went to the cinema excited to see Inception and was shocked to see a poorly constructed story that explained too much when it didn't need to and didn't explain enough when it should have. I look at it as a Matrix wannabe with action sequences that just weren't that great. It was not a thinking man's movie as was Memento or The Prestige either. It was a one trick pony - is he in a dream or not? Big deal - boring! 5/10 (given mostly for DiCaprio's acting) I just saw Shutter Island in my Home Theater, and man was it well done! There are similarities between the two movies, in that they both aim to confuse you as to what is reality and what is a dream/delusion. But that is where the similarities end. Unlike Inception, Shutter Island is well crafted and engaging. Scorsese is at the top of his game, always keeping the viewer interested and on edge. I know I'm in the minority on this view, given that Inception is the fourth ranked movie of all-time, as of this writing (what are you people smoking anyway!).

"If it wasn't for MST3K, I wouldn't have seen Manos: The Hands of Fate. I knew I had to see it to see if it really was that bad. The negative criticisms and those slamming it as the worst movie ever do not lie, Manos: The Hands of Fate is as bad as all that. There is such thing as a terrible movie that has novelty comic value, but there is also such thing as a movie that is too inept to take that into consideration. Some will disagree, but I consider Manos: The Hands of Fate as a good example of the latter. To call the way the movie is made amateurish is being too kind, the camera work and editing are all over the place and makes anything that happens incomprehensible. The visual effects are dated and make everything even more artificial than it already is, while the bizarre and often out of sync sound effects and a score that is shrill and monotonous are enough to make your ears bleed. And even when your poor ears are suffering enough, they are assaulted even more by dialogue that is stilted, insultingly cheesy and too talky and some of the worst and annoying acting ever in film history. The villain is quite possibly the most laughable and underwhelming villain ever and you'd be hard pressed to find one that is worse-acted than here. Torga is the best thing about Manos: The Hands of Fate, but that's saying nothing as he's still irritating. The direction is so flat that you have to look hard to find evidence of any direction at all, while the story is incredibly thin and is so plodding that you're dying of boredom. In conclusion, hopelessly inept. 0/10 Bethany Cox",negative,0,tt0060666
"One of the year's worst-reviewed big name project has arrived. It's another Scandinavian murder thriller - to sate the demand the producers hope exists. Starring Michael Fassbender as famous but alcoholic Oslo cop - sorry, elite squad's lead detective - out to catch an elusive serial killer. If you like the ""Millennium"" series, be warned: no strong female characters here. It's all about watching the sweet but curiously expressionless face of Fassender dragging himself through mounds of snow to try and stop the killings. The critics seem to not like the poor ""Snowman"" at all: 8/100 at Rotten Tomatoes, 23/100 at Metacritic. Users are comparably cold: 22/100 and 2.3/10, respectively. Don't worry, the movie's not actually that bad. It's just not a gripping one. The story unfolding on the screen is so pedestrian and lifeless that you have to be a fan of the genre, or Fassbender, to get some joy out of this. The makers can't hold the suspense even though there are always new murders to fall back on. Actors can make the story watchable but the result fails to ignite. I can't even think of anything interesting to say about this. The teenagers in the cinema, or the majority of the audience, seemed to like it though. I heard them discussing the most blood-curdling scenes later. It is true that the movie offers some not-PG-friendly blood and violence. The impressive cast includes Charlotte Gainsbourg, Chloë Sevigny, Rebecca Ferguson, Jonas Karlsson, J.K. Simmons, Val Kilmer, Toby Jones, David Dencik, James D'Arcy, Jamie Clayton, Michael Yates, Ronan Vibert, Adrian Dunbar. If only they had something interesting to do ... Kilmer at least looks interesting, like he escaped from botox clinic after series of unsuccessful experiments. Based on a novel by Norwegian crime-writer Jo Nesbø. It is the seventh entry in detective Harry Hole series, and the first one made into a movie. Director Tomas Alfredson has said that the production of ""The Snowman "" was rushed. He joined it late and reckons that up to 15% of the screenplay was not filmed. In addition, the location filming in Norway was shortened so that the production could move to London, which compromised story. So now we know.",negative,3,tt1758810
"I am a big fan of Batman Begins, but when watching The Dark Knight I was amazed at how well crafted it is, how the character evolve, the themes and emotions portrayed in the movie and the amazing performances. This is truly a masterpiece and one of the best crime saga's ever made. A perfect 10. When watching The Dark Knight you get introduced to a dark and violent world filled with all types of emotions. The story get faster as the movie proceeds and soon you are lost in the world of Gotham City. The dark tone of the film fits the new antagonist ""The Joker"" perfectly (who is portrayed in a marvelous performance by Heath Ledger)and as the story moves on you start to understand all the character and their inner darkness. I cant really say much without spoiling it but everything in this film is done to perfection- the story, the style, the acting, the music and the technical aspects. Also the film has numerous mixed emotions as the story progresses that truly make you think and analyze the events, and many moments in the film can only be described as epic. This is a must watch for anyone who enjoys movies as i can assure you you will be pleased and will want to watch it again. 10/10",positive,10,tt0468569
"IMDb Top 250: 10 There's a very good chance you've already seen The Dark Knight. It's very accessible: take one of the greatest superheroes of all time, add his archnemesis, one of the greatest modern directors, and few ties to its predecessor, and you'll come out with money. Over $1,000,000,000 of them. But behind all the hype, all the cash, and all the controversy (This film was successful only because Heath died!), you're left with one of the best films of the last decade, and the film that justifies comic book films to critics, non-believers and nay-sayers. Batman Begins was a revelation, but The Dark Knight elevates comic book films to more than a niche. Most series stumble with the sequel; no origin story means that other things need to fill in the first hour or so. But The Dark Knight barrels through that crippling problem: it's a completely new arc from Batman Begins, so new viewers aren't missing much. Right off the bat (oh ho ho) we're thrown into the action: the prologue follows a group of Clown-masked bank robbers and how their selfishness destroys them, and then reveals The Joker to be behind it all. The prologue is amazing, and sets the tone for the whole film: grim, and not completely focused on Batman. What follows is a dark look into psyche and morality, how good can be corrupted, and how absolute chaos can engulf even the most righteous of beings. The themes are layered and complicated, and not the most relatable for the average viewer, but extraordinarily well-handled. The acting is perfect again: Christian Bale is even more two-faced than Dent, magnifying his ignorance as Wayne and his intimidation as Batman. He does like to jump from playboy to inspired though, often in Dent's presence, making an ass of himself one second then kissing it the next. Alfred (Michael Caine) returns again as Bruce's mentor, offering a few stories to help Wayne think, and providing a nurturing hand when needed: and it is needed. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is also a key player, and his entire character is ironic right from the start: we know what will eventually happen. But his acting skills are there, showing the descent from Gotham's white knight to something else entirely, something different from the comics. This character is remarkably frightening, but is placed in a tough spot: he has to play second fiddle to the Joker, and is certainly underused. His revenge ends too soon, but at the same time it couldn't go anywhere else without changing the ultimate resolution. But for what we do get, Dent is excellent and has a great gradual (then sudden) development. Being second fiddle to anything is unfortunate, but Two-Face had to live in the shadow of the Joker. It's indisputable, Joker is the greatest Batman villain, and his turn in The Dark Knight is one of the best. The late Heath Ledger gives the ultimate performance, cumulating in a much deserved Oscar that breaks new ground for comic book acting. His Joker is everything you've heard: unpredictable, unnerving, and scary. Just his visual appearance is creepy, but with his voice, little movements, twisted sense of 'humour' and general style, he's the most frightening Joker ever and gives Batman an adversary that forces him to rethink his entire concept of justice. A very deserving portrayal. From start to finish The Dark Knight is filled with memorable scenes of action and dialogue. The parking garage, the escort chase, the sickening, heart-wrenching choice and the finale all show why Batman is the ultimate badass, and anytime the Joker opens his mouth it's pure gold. The film constantly is moving forwards, but feels slower than it is. Nolan took his time to create an epic-length masterpiece. Simply, The Dark Knight is technically supreme. It has an incredible dark art design, a shift from Batman Begins' orange tone to this blue tone. This lighting is notable, with effects such as Two-Face's good side in view only, or especially The Joker's white face being the only thing on screen, like the devil in the Exorcist. The film was amazing to see and hear in theatres and on Blu Ray. I love the IMAX: fullscreen action with remarkable detail, although it does lead to very slightly annoying jumps in aspect ratio. The sound is sweeping, the SFX brilliant: the musical score is great again, although used less frequently and without the main theme, although this shows that the film is less about Batman. The Dark Knight is a perfect expansion for this mythos. It's jaw- dropping, and in my opinion the greatest sequel of all time, maybe in a close race with The Empire Strikes Back but that's just me. My only worry is that The Dark Knight Rises won't be able to top it, and I have no clue how they will be able to do so. 9.3/10",negative,3,tt0468569
"The hype for Avengers Infinity War was truly real. The expectations were to the roof with this one, but I'm afraid we all did a huge mistake on what to expect. Can a 150 minute movie deliver on the level of these expectations and hype? Well it can't, but this movie does it's best.This film is completely different than any other MCU film, and any other film in general, and you will find that out when you see it for yourself. You must be happy to see your favourite character even for 5 minutes in this movie, that's one of the necessary cons of the mix, and we shouldn't expected more in the first place.The movie lacks basic plot development. That'sFORTUNATELY not a very bad thing in the end of the day. 
In general, the movie delivers what a 150 minute movie with 20+ main cast can deliver. The consequences were unexpected, and shocking, and the Russo brother did their best. I'm sure if you go to see he movie with low expectations you will enjoy it a hell more. 
9.5/10 After rewatching this movie I will change my vote from 8 to 9.5. *It's impossible for this title to remain at 9.5/10, and do not trust this number. Batman v Superman started at 9.8 as well, and we know where it ended up. Really, I think most of the fans will like it A LOT, but the score will drop A LOT once the movie opens in the US and China. Most of the votes now, come from people who have not even seen the movie yet.",neutral,5,tt4154756

"Manos: The Hands of Fate is a masterpiece ineptitude. The movie is hilariously bad and nothing short of a train wreck. Manos is slimly plotted and barely coeherrant. The acting is horrible and amateurish. Hal Warren is a terrible director even for a fertilizer salesman. It has even less camp value and lower production values than Plan 9 from Outter Space. The story behind the Manos and the making of the film would probably make a much better film. The film would certainly have toiled in obscurity if not for Mystery Science Threatre 3000. Manos is now a cult classic and landmark is cinematic Crap. Manos is likely the Worst Film of All Time. Beating out the likes of Battlefield Earth, Plan 9, and Garbage Pale Kids the Movie.

"Don't try to fool me that I didn't understand it, cause I did. And I must say, even though I wasn't at all confused by the script and plot as so many others seem to be, I don't think its a bad movie. But h**l, its not THAT good! I mean come on! I used to had no problems with this movie the first time I saw it, but I have learned to hate it, since its so EXTREMELY overrated (just having it 29 on the best movies ever is a proof). THE MATRIX is although trying really hard, but I can't even seem to be impressed by one single actionscene. In my opinion. Go see FACE/OFF or some other John Woo-movie to be stunned by action (it won't happen a lot). And it starts up with being (er, sorry trying to be) a smart sci-fi-movie, but suddenly Morpheus gets kidnapped by a team of wooden-acting-agents and it ends up like ANY OTHER bye-bye-brain actionmovie! Am I wrong? Climbing on walls, bounching off bullets, oohh... Give me a break! To be clear, I'd say like this: ''After 25 minutes we know what the matrix is, the rest of the movie is a long hyped up, action-standard, with a lot of glamour. Ehh... intelligent? NOT! I'm still confused how this movie got to be such a hit (yeah, go ahead mindless matrix-fans, laugh it all off), because the entire movie is old stuff, in a new package. The acting, with the exception of Laurence Fishbourne and perhaps little Joe too, is awful. Keanu seems tired and his entire face shines with that ''I should have listened to my mommy, and become a lawyer''-face. The rest of the cast is on the edge of average, many below. Oh, yeah, lets not forget all the martial arts. Eehh... is it only me, or are the guys who thought they were spectacular just unwilling to watch some old good Bruce Lee-films. Also, I would like to point out that this movie was NOT ORIGINAL! The main plot has been used many times before. If anyone can find something out of the ordernal, please give me a mail. Didn't think so. And has anyone of these matrix-lovers ever seen 2001? THAT'S an sci-fi movie! With effects that lives on still today! Why don't you guys check out THE MATRIX after about 33 years, it will probably be so boring that it won't be watchable, and people will wonder: How the h**l did this win 4 academy awards? Just thinking about Matrix 2, and 3 makes my blood chill. I guess my mailbox will be filled with criticism, after this, but I know how to respond, trust me...

The first half was a bit slow with many scenes that I felt lingered a bit too long. However, I loved Marlon Brando as The Godfather. The way he looked and acted was cool and conveyed a respected boss. I'm not entirely convinced on Al Pacino's character's transition, still in the second half his character became significantly better and more commanding. Of course the ending was awesome and showed the ironic way that Al Pacino's character changed. Overall it's a great first third. 8/10.",positive,8,tt0068646

This film didn't disappoint at all and it brought me back good memories about the other Batman films which was a huge plus. The acting was terrific and Christian Bale was a great Batman and almost surpassing Michael Keaton's Batman. Michael Caine was great as Alfred and Cillian Murphy played a great villain as Scarecrow. The music was good but not as great as the other Batman scores but that didn't cause a problem. The script was great and it made the dialogue at it's best and Christopher Nolan's superior directing gave this movie a great boost up.

"An amazing beginning gets even better with the sequel. From the start to the end this truly is the best superhero movie, but it does t feel that way. It feels so realistic and so believable as the world that is built by Christopher Nolan is so dense and aesthetically pleasing that the events that take place are seen by the audience as being real, which is why it doesn't feel like a over the top superhero movie, it's movie of a crime film. Anyway, the action...10/10 its so good because of the practical effects which leads back to the realism of the movie. The acting...10/10 you know what I mean...Heath Ledger will always be a legend and Christian Bales performance is great as always. All this is great but the part that is the best is the plot, it is so well put together and everything flows so smoothly. The only boring parts was near the beginning when there was some long but needed dialogue which really wasn't bad at all. The whole structure is so fluid and leaves you on the edge of you're seat the whole way through it. One complaint I have though is the slight comedy placed in the movie, it just feels out of place amongst the serious tone throughout the movie. Besides that I don't know what else to say...it is great in every way conceivable. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0468569
"Despite the obvious inspirations from other action movies, there some elements that make this film standout. I'm not only referring to the position of the camera, which to be fair, is kind of gimmicky and reminds me of a FPS game. The idea of watching a video game and removing its main charm (being its interactivity) might be kind of weird but it actually works out quite fine. The few cheesy jokes that are made in the film fulfill their purpose of being a contrast to the action and getting a slight chuckle out of the audience. The stunts are over the top, as in any action movie and, in my opinion, pretty cool.
I was surprised to see that the story became a little bit more than a reason to go to different locations. It actually has a couple of characters that seemingly pop in and out of existence, which is perfectly fine for this kind of movie. The characters are semi memorable. The 'semi' is mostly due to the fact that there isn't a lot of time spent talking, but as we all know: actions say more than words.
The editing is alright, I like the parts where two scene are seamlessly cut together, making me wonder which transitions where so seamless that I didn't pick up on the cut. At certain points in the movie, however, it does become clear that it isn't a Hollywood movie and 'only' had a budget of 2 million.
So, in short, watch this movie if you've watched too many James Bond movies and are willing to try something alternative.

"Expectations can kill a movie faster than a band of deadly orcs.  Few films garner the level of expectations like Lord of the Rings, and even fewer live up to and even surpass those expectations.  Peter Jackson bravely took the reins of the J.R.R. Tolkien's franchise and directed the first of three installments - The Fellowship of the Ring.  It is the harrowing story of young hobbit Frodo Baggins, who must deliver an all-powerful evil ring to the place of its creation and destroy it.  This first film of the trilogy introduces wise wizard Gandalf as Frodo's mentor and guardian, fellow hobbits Sam, Pippin and Merry as Frodo's sidekick friends and a host of other worldly travellers who accompany Frodo on his perilous journey through the vast world of Middle-earth.  Evil is lurking everywhere and the fellowship must protect one another through dangerous battles and monsters to reach their destination.  This scope of this film is beyond comprehension.  Some of the book is missing, and expectedly so.  The use of special effects are done masterfully and properly - which is one of this film's greatest achievements.  Effects serve to tell the story with realism and suspension of dissbelief, rather than dazzle audiences with over-the-top visuals and senseless computer generated ""look at me"" characters and locations.  Everything onscreen is done with such wonder and attention, without loosing sight of its characters, that Middle-earth truly comes to life and feels very real.  The actor's performances are excellent and we are quickly drawn into the mind and heart of each character.  Fellowship runs a lengthy three hours, but ends before you know it.  Its hopefull yet dark ending sets up the next installment with fevered anticipation.  This is the movie that special effects and Tolkien fans have been waiting for.  A must see.

"Not liking 'The Grudge' is tough for me because I am a big Nicolas Pesce fan. His first film 'The Eyes of My Mother' is one of my favourite films of the last decade and his follow up 'Piercing', while not as good, was still an enjoyable watch. To see that his next career move was a 'The Grudge' reboot was a little disappointing to say the least. It did give me hope though that possibly this would actually be a worthy entry in the series and one worth seeing. Sadly, that was not the case. This was not a good film at all. The simplicity of the horror (if you could even call it that) in this movie was astonishing. Everything that made 'The Eyes of My Mother' unique and great were completely missing. Instead, this film is just endless unearned jump-scares - and not even good ones. I literally could not count the amount of the times a ""scary"" looking image would appear on screen, only to disappear a moment later having absolutely no effect on the film. There was one genuinely well crafted scare in the film that actually gave me a jolt. Considering how many attempts there were though that is a terrible strike-rate. Th editing in this film is off the charts bizarre as well. The amount of scenes that get cut off the moment they become interesting is incredible. It was also extremely hard to follow which timeline and where in the story we were. The constant chopping of timelines made it really hard to just settle into the movie and let it tell its story and try to scare you. They got far too complicated in that respect. About an hour into the film I had this film pretty much locked in as a 4/10. Then a couple of scenes came along that were actually mildly well crafted. The final third of this film is the strongest part by a long way. Then an ending came along that was far too little, too late to save the film, but I did at least respect it. All of this managed to boost it up a point and at least save some face. I did also like that this film was a lot more violent and was more willing to show gruesome things than the original series seemed to be. Otherwise though this is a very hard film to compliment and not one I would recommend spending your hard-earned on.",negative,4,tt3612126
"Star Wars Episode 5 The Empire Strikes Back tells the story of the evil galactic empire attacking the hopeless rebellion after the destruction of the Death Star. One thing that I feel is worth noting right off the bat is that I don't think this film surpasses A New Hope but is ratter on the same level in terms of substance as well as quality. What makes this film good is that it is able to keep its focus on the characters in a universe that is so interesting as well as vast. That is something that makes the original trilogy better in my opinion because in the prequels it was focused on showing us heavily C.G.I. visuals ratter then on the characters. This is one of many factors that make the original trilogy by far the superior films. The plot is also more complex then the first of this trilogy which shows that the people involved with this project were taking risks. The characters were all likable and interesting. And the fact that they filmed at real locations shows dedication from the director Irvin Kershner. The cons of this picture though are not minimal which leads me to feeling as though it is grossly overrated. The acting and dialogue is still hooky, the effects are showing age, the action is underwhelming, and unfortunately the fan base that surrounds Star Wars has made it difficult to watch Empire as it was intended. The story although complex is occasionally driven forward by plot convinces. And although I did not see this infamous twist coming, I also was not all that wowed. In conclusion The Empire Strikes Back is complex and has relatable characters which is able to drive this picture forward as well as be entertaining. And I'm giving this one a 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0080684

I have actually notice a couple of new things that have made me appreciate the film even more! Quite frankly, it really ie insane just how good it is and how even 50 years later, it totally still holds up! A masterpiece of complete brilliance with genius storylines interconnected so beautifully ultimately making it super satisfying for audiences to connect the dots and really understand what's actually going on. The picture really showcases what life in the mafia is like and it is done with so much heart that you genuinely love and care about these characters as they are actually pretty relatable characters who often make a lot of sense, but yet are unfortunately born into a family full of crime! There are really not that many films out there that successfully manage to give the viewer an exciting and thrilling viewing experience, no matter how often they watch it. A real masterpiece by its definition filled with all-time great and iconic performances that essentially make up for an iconic, timeless classic that really has stood the test of time and presumably will be relevant! One of those films humanity can be proud of when looking back at pop cultural trends that have happened over time.

"I first saw Fight Club about two years ago.  Of course, I loved it.  I own the soapbox DVD.  So when the time came for me to choose some reading material last summer, I picked the book to read and see how it compared. I actually liked the movie better than the book.  I think it is better than the book, something that does not happen often (see Jurassic Park, both versions of Red Dragon, many Stephen King translations to film, etc.) The book is definitely unique.  It is told like the poems the Narrator reads about Jack's organs.  It is a lot of first person dialogue from a guy you are sure is a wimp.  I think the movie improves on it by the gimmicks like the changeovers and frames inserted.  Moreover, I feel the ending to the book was rather lacking and disapointing (maybe because of the great ending to the movie).  Most importantly, I think the movie emphasizes the actual Fight Club/Project Mayhem aspect better.  It is a major source of conflict in the film, while more of a backdrop in the book.  The book is more of an exploration of the relationship with Marla and the narrator's state of mind. It's also very short (if you try, you can read it in a day), while the movie is over two hours long.  If you read the book, you'll see a lot of the dialogue is lifted from there, but I think some of the quotes from the movie are snappier (the ""I want to have your abortion"" line on the alternate take found on the DVD is from the book, but the line ""I haven't been f**ked like that since grade school"" is just hilarious.)  About the only scene I could see from the book making the movie better/funnier is Tyler cooking Marla's mom's collagen ""gift."" The movie's very deep.  We, the audience, see characters in the same light as the Narrator does as the movie progresses.  Though Tyler seems to be the perfect buddy and collaborator, we all soon find him to be just a psycho and the liberated space monkeys as lemmings.  The despised Marla (I am Jack's raging bile duct) we all come to find endearing... somehow. 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523

"Having read a lot of praise for this film my expectations were possible too high but at the end of it I did wonder why it was so liked. I did admire it's desire to make it all seem realistic but at the end of the day it is still based on a comic book, and in trying so hard for credibility they forgot that it's still suppose to be entertaining. I thought the beginning bit with Liam Neeson went on far too long and reminded me of another film he has appeared in. I did like the supporting cast Caine and Freeman in particular but I'm afraid Christian Bale did absolutely nothing for me as Batman, I thought he was completely charisma free. There were occasional moments of excitement but it never seemed to really get going and the car chase sequence on the rooftops was a typical example where the action was awkward and uninspiring. This was obviously far better than the last Batman film but that was never going to be hard. I just hope the sequel is a little less dark and a bit more entertaining.(6/10)",neutral,6,tt0372784
"""Seabiscuit"" is a great movie for teenagers. It's a story of hope, the underdog, it will warm the cockles of your heart. I'll admit, it's fun to watch, especially if I saw this 20 years ago as a teen. Unfortunately as a male over 30, Seabiscuit is ends up wallowing in the dependency of a corny, over-emotional script blantantly devised to give you that ever-popular ""I feel good all over""- as only hollywood can do to sell. Anyone old enough and has a good 10-20 years of film watching behind them will no doubt sense this. I ended up feeling like a saw a very good made for TV movie or an after school special. The 3 main actors- Toby McGuire, Jeff Bridges, and Chris Cooper are really quite good and enjoyable to watch, which certainly helps this mush. I'm also in shock the makers left out an ending synopsis of the life of Seabiscuit and his remarkable history as we also NEVER find out what ever happened to him or his future. Instead, the credits just roll. This,to me, after watching the fluff for 2 and a half hours, was just more irritation. 6/10 for some fine acting, a nice story, and sheer harmless fun.",neutral,6,tt0329575
"No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. In the shawshank redemption, andy dufresne (tim robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to a tough prison. However, only andy knows he didn't commit the crimes. While there, he forms a friendship with red (morgan freeman), experiences brutality of prison life, adapts, helps the warden, etc. All in 19 years. Only grossing about 70 million in the box office, the shawshank redemption is the best example of ""don't judge a book by it's cover."" the movie accurately portrays the cruelty and brutality of life in prison by highlighting the struggles and suffering of every prisoner in different circumstances. As a result, it came across as very sentimental and moving. In addition to that, the determination to adapt is stressed on in this movie. If you ever need reassurance on the fact that all obstacles can be overcome, this movie is exactly what you need. It portrays the cliché ""nothing is impossible"" motto better than any movie has ever done. Other than the message of the movie, the acting was phenomenal. Tim robbins gave a truly inspiring and intelligent performance. In prison, robbins's character becomes friends with red (morgan freeman), who also gives us an amazing performance. These 2 show us the importance of friendship with their inseparable bond that can be detected from the very first scene, which also helps them survive day-to-day life in prison. With a limited set, director and writer frank darabont showed us what good writing really is. His use of irony and symbolism in the movie is like icing on cake. The movie also included shocking plot twists and an even more shocking resolution which resulted in a beautiful ending. Nominated for 7 academy awards, this film might be the best that never won an oscar. Score:9/10.",positive,9,tt0111161
"The Shawshank Redemption is the movie that is always discussed when talking about the all time greatest movies. It's just one of those movies that how it's told is better than the idea of it. With flawless directing, acting, casting, and dialog, it's sure to one of the all time greats. The movie teaches you that living is when hope over comes darkness. It amazes me that one of the most cheerful and hopeful movies takes place inside a prison. It is captivating to watch a man, presented with such injustice, fight to make a difference within the walls. Re-watched this classic. The importance of hope, friendship and perseverance of the human spirit in Andy's character is ever inspiring. 10/10",positive,10,tt0111161
"...""The Godfather"", as everyone knows, is a classic.  It follows the Corleone family over a period of a few years in the forties.  It starts with godfather Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and ends with godfather - and Vito's son - Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  Also involved are Sonny Corleone (James Caan), adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and muscle Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) to name a few. The acting ensemble is one of the greatest put together in film history. Brando plays the wise Vito Corleone very well, but the best performances come from Pacino as Michael and Caan as Sonny.  Pacino is probably the greatest character actor of all time, and this film shows it.  He plays Michael at the start with a young naivety and is able to bring the character along to the end of the film, where he shows the growth of Michael's knowledge and wisdom.  Unfortunately, Caan is only in about half the movie, but he certainly does an incredible job as the hot tempered Sonny. ""The Godfather"" is the template for good drama.  Few films achieve it's greatness, but in the end, it is surely not the best.  In my opinion, there is no best movie of all time, but many 'best' films per genre.  ""The Godfather"" is the best crime drama.  ""Casablanca"" is the best romance.  ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" movies are the best adventures.  All of said movies would tie, and be equal in greatness. So, if you're ever tired of these days' mindless action and mediocre drama films, then pop in one of the classics.  Any one will do, they are all equally entertaining.  Films like ""The Godfather"", ""Casablanca"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" are the reason movies are so popular. Enjoy, 9/10.",positive,9,tt0068646
"Pros: Cinematography, Directing, acting, memorable characters, Humor. Cons: Gets a bit too incredulous, violent. Fight club represents what will happen if anarchy is prevalent in our society. Thankfully this situation doesn't happen in real life. Ed Norton plays an insomniac who tries to get closure by attending Help groups such as AA even though he doesn't have any of the diseases the member of the groups have. Helena Bonham Carter disrupts his life when she does the same thing he is doing. Unable to go on with her hanging around, he and his alter-ego (Brad Pitt) decide to form Fight Club, a club for men who are fed up with thier lives. The club soon graduates to weekly boxing matches to terrorist activities and eventually gets too big for Norton to control. One of the best movies of 1999, Fight club is a satire on society that is both brutal and true in its findings. Premise: An insomniac finds escape through fight club. Fight club was nominated for a sole Academy award. Grade: 9.1/10 (Fincher's second best).",negative,1,tt0137523

I was for a long time told how this movie is groundbreaking, something legendary, something instantly classic... When Interstellar finally arrived to Netflix, I was pumped to see what all the fuss was about. oh, the disappointment. As astronomy and scifi enthusiast, Interstellar brings nothing new to the table. It's like average Doctor Who episode that outstayed its welcome with scenes that took way too long. Whole movie is so incredibly corny! so dumb! it was clearly made for those who have never watched scifi before, it was clearly meant to inspire people into astronomy, but is this the right way to inspire people into something? to make it as cheesy and corny of an adventure as possible? ...

The movie is incredibly well-acted by everyone involved, and it's still astonishing how Shayamalan, who has been on a long slump of disappointing movies, was able to pull this gem out of his magic hat at the very dawn of his career since it is still by far his best film to date. It's a classic and holds up due to all of the great acting, directing, and poignant moments from start to finish. Personally, my favorite part is when Willis' wife asks him why she left him and drops the ring on the ground. As it lands and rolls toward him, it's breathtaking and magical filmmaking.

"Last week I watched the first VHS movie. Though I had some criticisms, and going in I didn't expect much, to be honest, I came out really impressed by it. Some of the first VHS stories were very good, but what I particularly liked about it was the graphics, makeup and camera work. This week I decided to watch VHS2. I admit I had high hopes. I was personally disappointed, as I feel it lacked this sense of it feeling real, and looking real, like the I experienced with the first VHS movie. I think it lacked the kind of graphics, makeup, camera work and directing that the first films in VHS 1 had that made it feel more real. Having said all of this, if you are a fan of found footage horror, you may really like this, and you may like it more than the 1st. For anyone that this not familiar with the VHS movies, they are anthology horror movies. In VHS 2, I liked the concept of tape 2. Tape 3 was the only tape I really found to be done really well, I was really absorbed in it, damn a movie length film could be made about it. I only have one complaint about it, but can't say otherwise it would be a spoiler. So all in all, I give this 5/10. It had promise, but I feel let down. However I wasn't bored, and I do think that there will be people out there that will like this film. I personally prefer the first VHS.

"David Finchers 1999 classic Fight Club certainly lives up to the hype and deserves its cult following. Fight club is a variety of genres in one, a bit dark comedy, a bit physcological thriller and a bit social commentary. The unnamed narrator ( Edward Norton ) is a lonely, white collar job, insomniac who is addicted to self help groups and purchasing commoditys such as IKEA furniture. While on a flight he meets Tyler Durden who is a cool and rebelious guy who is everything the narrator wishes he could be. The two become good friends and form a fight club. Over time this fight club turns into something much bigger than the narrator can comprehend. As the film progresses tensions rise between characters and motives begin to form leading down to an unexpected conclusion where the entire film flips on its head in a moment of pure genius where we finally only understand what has been truly happening all along.

"I would be inclined to agree with the people that claim that The Matrix is unique, but probably not for the same reasons. In the beginning of the movie, I was on the edge of my seat, even Keanu Reeves' terrible acting couldn't upset me. I thought that the emerging storyline was one of the best I had seen. That feeling lasted untill the now legendary fight scene in the imaginary dojo. After this point the movie takes a huge step away from the style and course they laid out in the beginning. It got worse and worse as the movie wore on, and I seriously considered stopping the movie. I hadn't been as disappointed since Jurassic Park. If the moviemakers had just remembered to keep up the the innovative and awesome plotline, and not let it degenerate into one special effect after another, it could have been one of the greatest movies of our time. If you like to see a movie with excellent special effects, camera and lighting and action, this is clearly the movie for you. If you on the other hand demand that a movie has a complete and thorough plotline and story, just see the first half hour (or 45 minutes, I can't remember).

But with LOTR it's like the twilight zone where everybody else sees something that you don't!! I watched the first LOTR and HATED IT.  I thought I must've missed something, so I tried again several times, failing each time.  The second film was worse, it was just endless battle after battle, with characters like Frodo and Sam just whinging and whining. `don't give up mr frodo', `take courage sam'.. followed by more crying and another group hug.  It was filled with endless clichés and unnecessary dialogue, almost like the writer needed to fill the gaps to make it 3 hours long.  I swore after watching the first I'd never watch the second, but people told me it was better and that I'd like it!! I must admit the scenery was fantastic, the effects were superb and that's the only reason I'm giving this 2/10 rather than 1/10.",negative,2,tt0167261
"Already at the very beginning, after the car chase scene, this movie seems promising of heavy action sequences. The soundtrack is an important contributing element to the film's fast pace. Statham's performance as the calculating 'transporter' is exceptional. Unfortunately, a few sub-par elements take the shine out of this movie. Among them is a particularly bad performance by some members of the supporting cast, and (most importantly) a very weak plot. Basically every scene of the movie includes Statham, thus giving little opportunity to get to know the foes or their intentions a little better. All in all, this is a good action movie with very well achieved stunts. It is only regrettable that the trade-off for good action is the lack of attention provided to the making of the story. 6/10",neutral,6,tt0293662

I know it sounds like I'm contradicting myself,(Giving it a 10 and saying it shouldn't be number 1) but in my book, this movie deserves a 10. Anyways, I loved the dark feel of the movie, as many other people have said. Christopher Nolan made Gotham perfectly. Heath Ledger did do an awesome job as the joker, and I feel he actually does deserve an Oscar for his performance. It was gripping, thrilling, and even pretty scary/intense at moments. Christian Bale also did very well as Batman, much better than everyone else who's done Batman in the past. The ending is great, one of the best ending's I've seen in a while.

"After reading several reviews (I liked the one calling it lovable trash) I can only concur, but also add that, if you are going through something in your real life, you may want to tune into this to make yourself feel better. Seriously. Joe Eszterhaus wrote this, and the theme takes one sentence. (It is my above sentence). Basically if you want to see good drama concerning Las Vegas, watch ""Leaving Las Vegas"" (Elisabeth Shue, Nicolas Cage). If you need a laugh, watch this. We have Elizabeth Berkley (sadly for her an early attempt at drama, this was not all her fault). Alan Rachins with a few choice lines as a sleazy producer. Kyle MacLachlan, Gina Gershon,(who has recently been in a few episodes of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" proving she can do comedy). Overall there is a sadistic mob boss, more sleazy producers; I am sure you get the gist of it. Berkley isn't bad, considering the material, and some of the costumes she is expected to wear, and still making her a sympathetic character. Overall, if you are going through a bad break-up, or need to take your mind off things, this may be the ticket.4/10.",negative,4,tt0114436
"Good classic film with Russell Crowe. The opening scene is spellbinding, showing the true gore of battle, the fight scenes are marvellously realistic, discarding the popular ""pretty"" sword fighting for brutal aggressive force. The audience in the arena express every emotion, surprise, anger, and enjoyment. The cast is brilliantly chosen; we can really see Russell Crowe as a gladiator, in Commodus, Joaquin Phoenix gives us a man we can really hate, Connie Nielson shows real emotion and passion in the role of Lucilla. So apart from the spellbinding acting, scarily realistic fight scenes and the amazing script, what else can we look for? The music is just stunning, it's exactly what we need brought in at exactly the right time, truly wonderful directing. And then we have the stunning special effects, we can really visualise the greatness that is Rome, the fight scenes really make you believe. Some critics have condemned the lack of historical fact, for instance an emperor would never fight a gladiator, and these comments cannot be denied, it's true. 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0172495
"Halfway through: This morbid surreal thriller is indisputably well-made, but to me, it was so boring that I'm not capable of objective assessment of its quality. I'm not even sure if I'll endure to the end. I'm only a halfway through and I'm already bored to death. I had to switch from bed to chair to prevent myself from falling asleep... At the end: I do not think this has happened to me so far. I barely made myself watch it to the end, yet I still have the urge to give it the maximum rating. Excellent cast, great camera, directing, sound, atmosphere, but although I liked all those aspects individually, the overall impression was not that good. I love midf**k movies, perhaps it's my favorite genre, but this one was too Lynch-like for my taste. In the second half, however, it gets better and starts to keep me focused, and the outcome and especially the last scene are really powerful. I have to admit that this is one of the best movies I saw so far, but at the same time I did not enjoy it accordingly and I would not watch it again. 8,5/10",neutral,5,tt1130884

From Brad Pitt and Ed Norton on down through all the characters, including Meat Loaf, this movie thrilled me with its catchy soundtrack, editing, dialogue and, yes, violence.

I found this movie to be at turns hilarious, sad and thought-provoking.  Yes, I said thought-provoking.  I don't think it's too big of a stretch to say this could be a soul-searching type of movie.

"Peter Jackson and his team did not disappoint again, another epic film with tremendous scope. I also have to mention again the original music by Howard Shore; another great score with some really great themes. As far as performances go, well everybody did a great job but those that stood out (for me) were; Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Sean Astin as Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Bernard Hill as Theodin (King of Rohan). Also worthy of note were; Billy Boyd as Pippin, Dominic Monaghan as Merry, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, John Rhys-Davies as Gimli/Voice of Treebeard, Liv Tyler as Arwen, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, David Wenham as Faramir, Christopher Lee as Saruman, Karl Urban as Eomer and not forgetting Andy Serkis as Gollum/Smeagol. Having recently read the book I did find that this departed from J.R.R.Tolkien's original to a much larger extent than the first instalment 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. Much more is put into establishing background and motive than in the text and, to a large extent, it works pretty well. It does, however, distract from the task at hand in places and I did find it a little heavy going here and there. I can't, on the other hand, fault the production; it is all brilliantly brought together and it looks fantastic! The battle scenes are immense and to be admired. It's certainly one, despite a couple of misgivings, I still rate very highly. SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

"The number 666 (the so-called ""Number of the Beast"") has traditionally been associated with all things diabolical, so I thought this film would be a suitable subject for my 666th review for IMDb. At one time supernatural horror films normally dealt with assorted monsters, vampires, ghosts and things that go bump in the night, but in the sixties and seventies the fashion arose for what might be called the theological horror film, dealing with such matters as Satanism, demonic possession and the end of the world. ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Exorcist"" are films of this type, and ""The Omen"" is another in the same tradition. The central character, Robert Thorn, is very much a part of the American establishment- scion of a wealthy old-money family, a close friend of the President and his country's Ambassador to Italy. While they are living in Rome, Robert's wife Katherine gives birth to a stillborn child, and he is persuaded to adopt a baby born on the same night in the same hospital, and whose mother died in childbirth. They name the child Damien, a name presumably chosen because of its closeness to ""demon"". Soon afterwards Thorn is appointed US Ambassador to Great Britain- Italian viewers may not be pleased to note that in the movie this is regarded as a promotion- and moves with Katherine and young Damien to London. As Damien grows up, however, he becomes the focus of a series of strange and unsettling events, including the suicide of his nanny at his fifth birthday party. Thorn is warned by a priest that his adopted son is in fact the Antichrist, the son of Satan himself. At first he dismisses the man's warnings as the ravings of a lunatic, but later begins to suspect that there may be some truth in them, especially after the priest dies in a bizarre accident. Desperate to find out the truth, Thorn visits Rome and Israel with a photographer named Keith Jennings and realises that Damien is indeed the Antichrist. From a technical point of view, the film is well-made. This was Richard Donner's first major film and he showed the abilities he was later to bring to other action films such as ""Superman"" and the ""Lethal Weapon"" series. The action sequences are well handled and contribute to a growing sense of tension; only occasionally, as in the scene where Jennings is decapitated in a freak accident, do the rather primitive seventies special effects show through. This scene was clearly intended to be horrific, but today it comes across as inadvertently comic. The look of the film is dull and autumnal, regardless of the ostensible time of year, with a muted colour scheme, and this adds to its sinister atmosphere, as does Jerry Goldsmith's musical score. Gregory Peck was not the first choice to play Thorn- the producers originally wanted Charlton Heston in the role- but he plays it so well that one cannot imagine any other actor in the part. Thorn is similar to some other Peck characters, such as Atticus Finch in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and Sam Bowden in ""Cape Fear"" in that he is a decent, liberal man suddenly confronted with the problem of evil, except that Thorn is confronted with evil in its purest form and with a dilemma- whether or not to kill his adopted son- even more stark than anything which confronted Finch or Bowden. There is another very good performance from Billie Whitelaw as the sinister Mrs Blaylock, who becomes Damien's new nanny after the suicide of her predecessor and quickly becomes his guardian angel. Or rather his guardian devil, as she is a servant of Satan sent to protect the boy form harm. My reservations about this film are largely theological. My own religious position is a liberal one, and although I believe in the existence of God I do not believe in the literal existence of the Devil who is, at most, a representation in symbolic form of man's capacity for evil, not some sort of rival god. I am normally prepared to suspend my scepticism about supernatural phenomena in the interests of good entertainment; I have never, for example, allowed the fact that I do not believe in witchcraft to spoil my enjoyment of the Harry Potter films. I tend, however, to make an exception in the case of films which ask me to accept the literal existence of Satan, or which preach that the end of the world is nigh, and there is a reason for this. A literalistic interpretation of the Book of Revelation as a prophecy of a coming Armageddon has always struck me as a hallmark of the most reactionary and intolerant sort of Christianity, the sort which is always more ready to hate one's enemies than to forgive them and which finds it easy to identify the Antichrist with whichever enemy (the Pope, Muslims, the United Nations, whoever) is at the top of that particular sect's hate-list. I doubt if the makers of this film made it with the explicit purpose of furthering a Christian fundamentalist agenda; a much more likely motive was to emulate the financial success of ""The Exorcist"", which had been one of the biggest films of 1973. Nevertheless, I feel that that is the sort of agenda which this film, and others like it, may well inadvertently further. 6/10",neutral,6,tt0075005
"In what looks like a screwball type comedy with two former SNL alums starring, The Skeleton Twins turns out to be one of the more touching films of the past year. Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig give magnificent performances as two troubled siblings that find each other after near tragic circumstances and being estranged for 10 years. Right from the core it seems to be an interesting story, but it takes a much different route than you would expect. Wiig in what is probably her best performance to date is a married woman who is also having difficulty with the possibility of having a kid while also having an affair with her scuba instructor. Hader was just rescued from an attempted suicide and now moves in with Wiig to try and reconnect and establish a new life. The film is brilliantly acted but is also meticulously written. I really enjoyed all the little scenes with Wiig, Hader, and even Luke Wilson who gives an understated performance as well. You can tell how much chemistry Hader and Wiig have developed over the years on SNL has helped them on this film. No only is it a great story of reconnecting with your loved ones, but it's a fantastic real life moving story of people struggling with real life issues. Addiction, suicide, and infidelity are all main issues tackled in this Sundance winner. She wont be nominated by Wiig deserved a lot of praise for her out of the box performance here.

"Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, is my favorite movie of all time. This movie created my love for movies, and even for Batman and the Joker. From the moment that Hans Zimmer's gripping score beings in the opening scene, to the first time we see Heath Ledger give the performance of a lifetime as the clown prince of crime, I was hooked. The setting feels dark, gloomy, and even evil at times, but yet I am compelled to buy a plane ticket to the city. I would like to say that this is because of Batman, that I want to fight the crime in Gotham and be a member of the GCPD (but less corrupt). But the truth is that I want to see the Joker (from a safe distance). The Joker offers such high levels of charisma and dark humor that you don't have to fool yourself by saying you love to hate him. Be honest, you hate that you love him. In this city of corrupt cops, dirty money, white collar crime, and gang activity, who better to look to than someone who makes even the most wicked of people look sane. Nolan has presented a world where the joker isn't so much a mad clown, as he is a mad scientist. Maybe he lacks morals, but even his most convoluted plans are artfully crafted. The Dark Knight is not a comic book movie. The Dark Knight is an action movie based on comic book locations and characters. That seems simple enough, but I stand by the fact that it is the only film of its kind (including the other two in the trilogy). Even the best of comic book movies such as Iron Man or The Avengers, are still very much comic book movies. The Dark Knight was able to rise above that title to become something more than that. Christian Bale gave us the best performance as Bruce Wayne as seen on the big screen to-date, and Heath Ledger gave us possibly the greatest performance of all time as the joker.

Come on..., the Godfather series has its moments and especially the first one is not a bad movie at all. But, IMHO, almost all the other major movies about Mafia (especially ""Goodfellas"" & ""Once Upon a Time in America"") are, more interesting and better art too than the bombastic Godfather series. I find even Brando's acting in these movies below his normal standards. And let me tell you why many people like these mafia movies so much: it's just because many people secretly in their heart admire and envy the ""wild & free"" life style of the gangsters. Just the same reason why Bonnie & Clyde etc. are so popular. Or youngsters love to read the Nicky Cruz biography ""Run, baby, run"" because they find the violent & brutal life of the young gangsters exciting and fascinating, blindly ignoring the fact that the author's message is totally against that. Sadly, it is often the same with movies. You think Quentin Tarantino is so popular among the masses because of his artistic merits? You think wrong.",positive,9,tt0068646

The setting of the sixties accompanied by some songs of Frank Sinatra gave me the impression to be in that time. I can recommend it to everyone that likes heist films.

"if it wasn't for ledgers performance i would have given it a 6/10. i think he gave a great performance & we finally saw a joker that wasn't more of a Clown than anything else....i also think the way he looked in the make up helped him sell the character, there were times just looking at him was freaky.... Batman Begins, the first movie was better in my opinion. this movie got away from batman's stealth/ghost-like/strike fear character. he's running out to fight criminals & walking threw night clubs clobbering guys to get to the mob boss in one scene. remember in Batman Begins, in the asylum when the thugs crapped themselves if he was a ghost or could fly, then the lights went out. Batman started pulling guys up from the ceiling.....then he would vanish, pop up behind another thug & take him out, then dip into the shadows, take out another thug, etc.... NO.....in this one he no longer does that or anything he was trained to do by his secret society friends....there was a scene when the joker crashed a fund raiser with a hand full of his henchmen.....would be much better if the lights shut down, one henchman gone....another out cold.....there goes another flung across a table, boom....the lights go back on & batman is right behind the joker, standing all alone.....INSTEAD he runs out there & sucker punches the joker, gets into a scuffle with his goons, one guy catches him w/ a shot & drops him to one knee (this is the same batman that took on a 1000 ninjas in the first flick?!....lol, well u know what i mean) anyways.....same mistake as spiderman 3......love triangle was draaaaawn out, too looooong of a movie by at least 20-30 min, what was the point of 2face if your going to kill him 25 min later....BATMANS SCRUFFY VOICE was annoying!!!! he had waaaay to much dialog in the movie & shouldn't have been yapping that much to begin with.....the drawn out scene toward the end w/ joker hanging upside down not only got people a little dizzy, but NOBODY TALKS THAT LONG UPSIDE DOWN, lol, I don't care how crazy u are! was it a bad movie , no.....was it worth all the hype......NO......it was definitely blown up over ledgers death they should have stuck to the Batman Begins Character & Not made the same mistakes Spidey 3 & Superman returns did",neutral,6,tt0468569
"A powerful and fantastic tale of loss and redemption. Featuring a great cast. Powerful dialogue, with a great score. It really knows how to pull at the heartstrings too. I felt myself tearing up at a couple of parts. This is also due to the wonderful performances from the entire cast especially by Edward Norton and Edward Furlong. Although it has many positives aspects to it, for some people the language used and the brutality of some of the scenes may be a bit too much for some people to handle. So I can see why some people may not like it. In conclusion I thought American History X was a fantastic movie and a must see for film lovers. 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0120586
"My only criticism of this otherwise brilliant movie is that it is a little too long. But it is an extremely good film, that along with the original Batman could very well be the best of the Batman films(thought perhaps just lacking the original film's sophistication). People may find this blasphemy, but I did prefer this over The Dark Knight, but that was still very good. Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is stylish, dark and gritty, pretty much what Batman should be. I have seen complaints that the film ""contradicts"" the 1989 film. Perhaps so, but what I can say in the film's defence is that Batman Begins is sort of a very loose prequel to the original movies. Visually, Batman Begins looks absolutely incredible! It could very well be the most beautiful visually of the Batman films, with beautiful cinematography and a simply dazzling view of Gotham City itself. Another asset I appreciated was that the music score didn't overpower the action, in fact it gave some atmospheric flavour to it. As much as Danny Elfman's scores were outstanding and definitely memorable, Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard do a great job with the score. The script is taut and well-written with lines that really make you think along with some occasional offbeat humour, the plot isn't convoluted or predictable but original, the film moves briskly(the second half was marginally better in terms of pacing to the first half though but that is in no way a flaw) and the action is explosive particularly the climax and the bat-mobile car-chase. Also Christopher Nolan's direction is excellent. The acting, aside from the visuals is what drives the film. Christian Bale is for me the best Batman since Michael Keaton. In the role of Batman he is suitably dark and brooding, like Batman should be, and as Bruce Wayne, he is dashing, handsome and ambitious. Katie Holmes actually surprised me and in a good way. She wasn't bland or annoying, I actually found her sympathetic and surprisingly good. Liam Neeson is also very good, though he has been better, while Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred. Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson and the excellent, underrated Gary Oldman are also solid in their roles, while Morgan Freeman is wonderful as always. Overall, a brilliant film that is visually stunning, gripping and atmospheric. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",neutral,5,tt0372784
"The first thing I have to say about this film is that it is easily one of the most appalling films I have ever watched. It frankly disgusts me that these people were given millions of dollars to produce such utter shite. I laughed once throughout the entire film at a line delivered in approximately the first 2 minutes, the rest was embarrassing and insulting to watch. I can justify watching an awful film if I can laugh at it, such as 'House of the Dead', which despite being a train wreck of a film was actually unintentionally quite funny. However, Meet the Spartans despite aiming to be funny was frankly excruciating to watch. All I could think of throughout was that I was slowly losing an hour of my life and £5.50 that I would never see again. The jokes are immature and at times homophobic. The humour is basically trash that I'm almost certain could and would have only appealed to a group of 15 year old boys. Upon leaving the cinema I have never seen such a depressed group of people. The movie is from the same writers as 'Date Movie', 'Epic Movie' and the Scary Movie films. I personally am quite a fan of the Scary Movie films and thought I would give this the benefit of the doubt despite being very disappointed with 'Date Movie'. I have however learnt my lesson now and shall be investing no more money into watching any of Jason Friedberg or Aaron Seltzers films. The cast is not particularly promising but neither did I expect it to be a death sentence. Sean Maguire and Carmen Electra both star in the main roles, but I personally don't think the casting had anything to do with the fall down of this film, nothing could have saved this. The script is frankly appalling, the story is messy and the humour is just offensive; sadly not in a tongue in cheek way. I think that Mr. Friedberg and Mr. Seltzer need to learn the use of subtly. Sometimes less really is more. It seemed with this film everything including the jokes had to be taken to the extreme. Their exhausting efforts to be funny are actually the only funny thing about this film.",negative,2,tt1073498
"okay, I finally rented this movie. I didn't know anything about this movie except for a few friendly reviews from some armchair critics. so I'm going to put in my opinion now. it didn't do it for me. I gave this movie a 6/10 because although the acting was really well done - you could see exactly where this movie was going - in that the movie essentially starts at the end and goes virtually nowhere. I guess I'm just not in to the jumping time lines that take you back and forth in order to further the plot and understand why he wrote the stuff on the back of the photos. It was mediocre after hearing everybody saying ""oh yeah, this was an awesome flick!""...just don't seem to understand what all the hubbub was about.",neutral,6,tt0209144
"It's very easy to let high expectations get the better of you when you watch a film. Maybe the film is perfectly fine, but nowhere near as good as you had expected, and so you are left with a bitter taste in your mouth when sans these expectations you would have had a fine few hours (looking at you, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). Or maybe your expectations are simply too high for any film to realistically meet. The Godfather could have easily fallen into one of these two categories. After all, when it comes to films that carry high expectations, it's hard to top The Godfather. And yet, in spite of all that, the film is still a masterpiece that enthralled me for all 3 hours of its runtime. Trust me when I say this film is one of those classics that has earned its legendary reputation. Almost everything about in this film is done to great effect. Even things I don't usually notice (unless they're really bad) like the editing and the sound design are done masterfully, the score is not only beautiful but the film knows when not to use the score and let the tension build, and of course you can't talk about The Godfather without talking about the legendary director and cast. With Francis Ford Coppola at the helm of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duval, James Caan, John Cazle and Diane Keaton, and an amazing story on top of that it really shouldn't surprise anyone this film is as good as it is. There are so many more things I could say to sing this films praises, and so many more things that deserve praise, so many amazing scenes and so many memorable moments/lines, but really, you should just see the film yourself. 10/10",positive,10,tt0068646
"Well where to begin this film for me is the pinnacle of film. Its beautiful in every way. The music, acting, scenery, is virtually perfect. Marlon Brando for me gives the stand out performance in a fantastic cast. The film is captivating from start to finish. There really isn't enough praise I can give for this film, it really deserves its name in the greatest films of all time, if not THE greatest. The film does a brilliant job at immersing you into the story of the Corleone family. You will struggle to find a film as engrossing and powerful as this one. I only wish films of today where made with such passion and brilliance. 10/10 a must watch for any film fan.",positive,10,tt0068646
"I can't work out why I originally gave this a 6/10 - may have been in a bad mood or something. Watching this again right after all the prequel movie's actually made me appreciate some of those inputs a great deal more, in light of specific elements of backstory made reference to in this movie. Not a whole lot of retconning going on actually, in the newer movies, in reflection upon re-watching this one. Following a much darker period in the prequels, this does seem a little on the light side, though there are moments of comedy in the prequel elements. It does actually hold up remarkably well, even all the visual effects. I watched the somewhat post-prequel updated or specialized version, rather than the original or de specialized edition, and aside from a couple of slightly shoddy new effects, and old ones, it's remarkably good. I do wish that the prequel's had been a little lighter, especially in the recent Obi Wan series, with Obi Wan's character, given he's not a particularly serious individual in this movie - rather relaxed in my estimation. The only real misgiving I have about this movie comes from a particular light saber battle, which I do wonder if the prequels lent themselves towards undermining, inadvertently, given they're better equipped to pull those related visuals off. Anyway, this is fun, well written, well acted, looks great (despite being quite an old sci-fi movie), and in my estimation would potentially even hold up with consideration to younger audiences that may inevitably drift into this in the wake of the prequels, other series pieces, and more recent franchise sequels.",neutral,6,tt0076759
"Yes, they certainly did a good job with the Golm character and computerization.  All of the computerization landscape and animals etc were well done.  And the acting is as good as can be expected with such stilted dialogue.  Don't worry if someone is kicking your seat, coughing, or crunching candy next to you.......missing any of this dialogue doesn't matter.  As a matter of fact, I wore earplugs through the second half of the movie to save myself from the headache that the endless parade of battle scenes was giving me.  I guess when the producers lay out so many millions they want the surefire draw of bombastic Hong Kong kung fu broadsword swinging noise that will bring back 11 year old action patrons over and over.  I suggest you rent it on DVD so you can skip forward past much of the battle scenes which should have been cut to shrink the movie by 30-40 minutes.  But you would be better served to buy and read the books instead. Authors don't have to resort to noise and battle scenes to sew a great story together.  And movie producers only think they can.",neutral,5,tt0167261
"Theatres are finally back open again! To celebrate I had a lot of choices. But I decided I should go back to a film I hadn't liked as much as the general public the first time I saw it. I had seen the opening scene on YouTube a few weeks ago and I wanted to see it on the big screen and well... yeah it didn't disappoint. A lot of the times for me a movie either has enough action for me to forget about the characters or enough character depth for me to care about everyone. This is one of the rare and I truly do mean rare occasions where neither of those things happens because they both blend together so well. The depth behind Bruce Wayne in this film is amazing. Because while in Batman Begins he has to fight against his own morals and such in this movie he has a lot more resting on his shoulders. He has the entire city of Gotham looking up to him as Batman and he still has his own feelings about Rachel that he is fighting against. The score and camera work in this movie are both done well. Knowing the outcome of certain characters and watching it again really helps you to appreciate it more, pay attention to what the film shows you and you will appreciate it. It all does pay off. The score of the film really surprised me. While on the first watch I was focussing on the action on this watch I was focused on character interactions. The chemistry between Christian Bale and Michael Caine is phenomenal. I also like how in this movie they show off parts of Bruce Waynes intelligence and his problem-solving. My problems with this movie are few but sadly they are enough to keep it from that 10/10 rating I was hoping to give it. There are a few spots where the CGI and sound design are off. It's not consistently enough to ruin the movie or anything like that but I did personally notice it. I also feel like the rising action in the middle of the film was better than the ending. While the ending does leave you with more of a philosophical thing I did think that the action in the middle wasn't topped by anything else in the film. There are also a few tiny plausibility errors here and there but it is after all still a superhero movie so it's not like I'm going to be screaming my head off about it. Overall I liked it a slight bit more on a secondary watch, happy that theatres are open again",positive,10,tt0468569
"The year was 1972. Francis Ford Coppola was in the beginning of this career, and he was only in the process of proving himself as a director. Little did he know, that he was going to direct a movie which would go down as possibly THE most beloved and acclaimed film of all time. The movie was ""The Godfather"". It became the highest grossing film of the year 1972, and of all time (in 1972)! It won 3 Oscars: Best Actor (Marlon Brando), Best Adapted Screenplay (Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola) and Best Picture (Albert S. Ruddy). Unfortunately, Coppola did not take home the gold for directing, nor did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall or James Caan for their brilliant supporting roles! But Oscars really doesn't matter, the movie still stands as a piece of cinematic brilliance! The Godfather tells a relatively simple tale: Michael Corleone (Pacino) is son of the powerful mafia don Vito Corleone (Brando). Michael recently returned from the WW2, and he wants nothing to do with the ""family business"". Vito doesn't want that either, but after a chain of events, Michael is forced to rise as the new family don, in order to protect his family and allies from downfall. The movie doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. It's a simple plot, it's one we can all understand and it's still en epic gangster movie! And that's the other thing about the film: it's very epic in scope! All the locations, all the props, all the actors, etc. It all comes together to create something magical! Al Pacino keys in an amazing performance as Michael, the son who must protect his family! At first eye-drop one could call his performance ""low-key"". But it's merely an observation of the characters calmness, subtlety and his cold nature, that transforms into a calculating, ruthless and chilling persona. Apparently, Pacino approached the role with this thought. For my money, this was an Academy Award-worthy performance. Marlon Brando is equally impressing as Vito Corelone. His performance is calm, determined and calculated. But Brando doesn't only present Vito Corleone as a cliché ruthless mafioso don, but also as a father that loves his family, and that the audience can admire and care for. Robert Duvall, James Caan, Talia Shire, John Gazale and Diane Keaton is also presented as capable and great characters! Everyone gets tons of character development, and their performances are spectacular! Nino Rota's haunting score perfectly illustrates what kind of film we're dealing with here, and every time you hear it the score feels new and epic! This has got to be one of the most memorable film scores of all time! The cinematography is beautiful, the sound is fantastic and overall The Godfather is a truly beautiful film to admire! Puzo and Coppola's screenplay is brilliant and filled with memorable lines: ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"", ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli"" and ""It's not personal Sonny, it's strictly business"". Francis Ford Coppola truly captures the feeling of a spaghetti gangster movie, and his direction is brilliant, tireless and visible in every scene! Twentieth Century Fox wanted to replace him several times during production, but thankfully they didn't! He was robbed an Oscar! The Godfather is a movie that will never grow old, and we will be able to watch if for many years to come! It always feels fresh and exiting every time you watch it! From the first monologue by Bonasera, to the last shot of Michael Corleone as the new don, this movie leaves you shattered by the perfection. Saying The Godfather is a perfect movie, is like saying Chuck Norris is badass. See my point? A must-watch for everyone! 10/10",positive,10,tt0068646

The dialogue is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how horrible it all is, the music, the acting, everything. People think that Gigli is the worst movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Gigli is more moving, and has a worse storyline than Showgirls. The thing I find so amazing about Showgirls is how Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley) changes throughout the movie(not).

"This movie makes a totally pointless impression. The story and characters are totally uninteresting and the movie is way too long. None of Verhoeven's style and excellence are present in this movie, so not even fans of him will get a kick out of this. This is a movie with basically zero story. The movie is not really heading anywhere and the characters certainly don't make this movie more interesting either. Nomi Malone is a pretty weird character if you ask me. It is unclear at times what she exactly wants and she keeps changing her mind time after time which gets a little annoying after a while. A movie were you already don't understand the main character is per definition already a bad one of course. It really is the pointless story and the not understandable characters that ruin this movie. The movie takes itself way too serious. I have the feeling that the movie would had been better had it more humor and satire in it. But none of Verhoeven's typical humor is present in the movie. The only typical Verhoeven aspect present in this movie is nudity but besides that, there is no other way that you can tell that Verhoeven directed this movie. The nudity might be about the only thing this movie deserves credit for. I mean, this is finally a movie that isn't afraid to show total nudity and the main actresses aren't afraid to take of all their clothes and do some explicit scenes. It isn't really that bad as a movie, I mean it is still a movie that had been made with lots of flair and style but the totally pointless, uninteresting and ridicules story makes this a movie that you probably would be better of not watching. 4/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",negative,4,tt0114436

"While it is lost in the vast sea of middling superhero fare, The Dark Knight is one of the greatest movies ever made. The somewhat hefty runtime of more than two and a half hours flies by as a captivating and inspired story makes for one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I've ever had. From a technical aspect the movie is just as masterful, notably the cinematography which is eerily beautiful. The effects team pulls out all the stops making both The Joker and Harvey Dent look like they could be real. Heath Ledger's performance may be one of the greatest displays of acting ever put to film. Ledger brings subtlety and nuance to a role that could have come across as a bit too slapstick. The script backs up Ledgers Joker by injecting him with nihilistic motives that make him the most interesting person in the room, even when the other person is dressed like a bat. The writing of the characters is handled with intense care and the climax doesn't fail to disappoint, once again aided by great performances by Christian Bales stoic and graveling Batman and Heath Ledgers unpredictable and haunting Joker. Philosophicaly the movie plays upon themes of nihilism and chaos vs justice. The movie projects it's more sophisticated of messages with no restraint and doesn't talk down to the audience. It breaks the mold of the average superhero movie by portraying similar ideas of hope without the more gratuitous and heavy handed film making of its genre-mates. Overall, The Dark Knight, often penalized for the sins of its species prove that a superhero movie can be this good. 10/10",positive,10,tt0468569

"High on battle scenes and low on actual substance, ""Infinity War"" is the culmination of ten years' hype. And that kind of buildup is embodied in the CGI; this is a visual feast (or marvel, if you will). I mean, this thing bursts with color. But it's also fairly empty. I mean, hey, that's a *lot* of characters to stuff into a movie, but it feels like one huge chessboard, whisking away certain faces to accommodate others. In that sense, this Marvel galaxy is fractured, and the movie feels choked with characters as a result. If I have a problem with this movie, it's this: the stakes are never real. Size notwithstanding, Thanos is especially weak here (given his buildup in the Guardians movies), and I didn't walk away thinking that (most) of the deaths are permanent. It's almost antiseptic in that regard; c'mon, they just fade away? Everyone's comparing this to ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but that's only because it's a downer. And only mildly. I don't mean to harp on the movie. It lives up to the demands of orchestrating a boatload of properties while delivering the high production values. And it's a solid Summertime distraction.

Plenty of funny one-liners (""Do you have Health Insurance?"" ""Yes, Green Cross!"") and a great cleavage-revealing costume worn by the female lead for 90% of the film make this well worth your time.

Luckily we didn't get to his dirty underwear.

"When my brother first told me to watch this film, I dismissed it as another all-action no-storyline movie. It was only once I got into film that I decided to give it a go, and I proved to myself how wrong I had been! At times the violence was hard to watch, but the great acting from Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, among others, had me hooked. The film also had a brilliant plot, which I really didn't expect, which made the film even more appealing; from the very beginning, the characters and relationships are intriguing and yet realistic. The film follows Jack, (Norton), whose totally average life means he's pushed into total boredom. That's until he meets Tyler Durden, (Pitt), a charismatic character who seems to represent to Jack everything which is appealing in one man. Soon, the two are locked in a violent fight, and find it surprisingly refreshing. And so 'Fight Club' is born - a secret organisation where people go to have friendly, yet often brutal, fights. However, it's only as the club grows to great success and Jack becomes happier in his newfound importance as joint club-founder, that he comes to realise a shocking truth that will challenge everything he thought about himself and the new life he and Tyler created. I'ts one of those films where you can watch it over and over again but it just gets better, because you can then realise the subtle hints throughout which make the film brilliant, which you can only fully appreciate once you know the ending. It's an overall excellent film, and I give it 9/10.",positive,9,tt0137523
"I grew up on the animated series, loved the first two Batman films, sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this. The film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive. The plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards. The music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film. And I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred. There is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory. Overall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",neutral,5,tt0468569
Grabbed this off Fios. The concept for this movie had potential and I actually liked the cast. The acting was inconsistent and the writing was mediocre. The intro and conclusion based on the premise are solid but the storyline and subplots were poor. I wouldn't recommend this. I'd give it a 1/10.,negative,1,tt0983946

"The story of this film takes place over a twenty-year period between 1947 and 1967. Andy Dufresne, a young banker from Portland, Maine, is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sentenced to life imprisonment. (""Shawshank"" is the name of the prison where he serves his sentence). The prison is a brutal place, and Andy is frequently beaten and sexually assaulted by a gang of homosexual inmates called ""The Sisters"". Two things, however, help him to survive. One is his friendship with another convict, Red, who has a reputation for being able to acquire almost any item and, for a price, to smuggle it into the prison. The other is his financial expertise, which he puts to good use, becoming a tax and financial adviser to the prison guards and even the Warden himself. As a reward for these services, Andy is given a privileged job in the prison library and protection from molestation. To avenge their attacks on Andy, the leader of the ""Sisters"" is so badly beaten by the guards that he is crippled for life; Andy is not molested again. The Warden devises a scheme under which inmates are put to work on local construction projects. The purpose of this is ostensibly to prepare them for life after they are released, but in reality he is exploiting their free labour for his own personal profit, and using Andy's financial skills to launder the proceeds. This arrangement seems to work to Andy's advantage, because of the extra privileges he is granted, but things change when a new young prisoner named Tommy Williams is sent to Shawshank. Tommy has evidence that could secure Andy's release; a former cellmate in another prison has confessed to him that he committed the murders for which Andy was convicted. Tommy confides this secret to the Warden who, fearing that his illegal schemes will be revealed should Andy ever be released, arranges to have Tommy murdered by a corrupt guard. There is a long history of American prison films, including the likes of ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"", ""Cool Hand Luke"", ""Brubaker"" and the more recent ""The Last Castle"". (Frank Darabont was later to direct another prison film, ""The Green Mile"", based, like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" on a Stephen King story). Most of these were made with a liberal social agenda in mind, aiming to expose the harsh prison conditions and thereby inspire their reform. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" falls, to some extent, within this tradition; it is made from a basically liberal viewpoint and vividly depicts the brutality of prison life, although the fact that it is a period piece, set several decades in the past, might suggest that social issues were not the filmmakers' sole concern. Perhaps more important are the analysis of the nature of freedom and of the relationship between Andy and Red. The word ""prison"", from the French ""pris"" (""taken""), merely indicates a place where captives are held, and the authorities, especially in America, prefer to describe many prisons by some more positive term such as ""penitentiary"" or ""reformatory"" which implies their purpose of rehabilitating criminals. Shawshank, a prison where the Warden and guards are at least as crooked as the inmates, has precisely the opposite effect. Andy goes in innocent of any crime and comes out guilty of being an accessory to corruption and fraud. Yet, despite his involvement in the Warden's dishonesty, Andy retains a certain integrity; he refuses to give up hope and refuses to allow himself to be beaten by the system. Although he is in prison he has found a sort of freedom. A key moment comes when he defies the guards to play a Mozart aria over the prison loudspeakers for all the inmates to hear- a reminder of spiritual values even in the harshest of environments. Red faces a different problem. He fears that he has become so institutionalised that he will be unable to survive freedom, as happened to another long-term prisoner who committed suicide shortly after his release. In prison, his role as the ""fixer"" who can obtain anything, be it a packet of cigarettes, a rock hammer or a poster of Rita Hayworth, makes him the king of the inmates. (These latter two items will play an important role in the plot). On the outside he will be just another ex-con trying to make ends meet in a dead-end job. Paradoxically, he is more free in jail than he will be on the outside. I won't give away the ending, but it involves Andy repaying Red's previous kindnesses by showing him how he can be free in all senses of the word. The film was not a great box office success when first released but has since acquired a status as one of the classics of the modern American cinema; it has now supplanted ""The Godfather"" as number one on IMDb's Top 250 list. The film would perhaps not be number one on my personal list, but it is a fine one and would certainly be in my top 250, perhaps the top 100. Its two stars, Tim Robbins as Andy and Morgan Freeman as Red, are both excellent. Its initial lack of success may have had something to do with its rather clumsy title. ""Shawshank"" is not a word that will mean anything to the average person (according to one story Darabont was once asked how his ""rickshaw"" film was going) and ""redemption"", except in technical legal contexts, normally has a religious connotation. This is not an explicitly religious film; indeed, in its portrayal of Warden Norton as a sanctimonious, Bible-bashing hypocrite, it can be seen as critical of religion. Nevertheless, the word ""redemption"" is perhaps appropriate in this context, after undergoing the hell of Shawshank Andy and Red manage to find a sort of secular redemption. It may be this message of hope that accounts for the film's continuing popularity. 9/10",positive,9,tt0111161
"A new force threatens Gotham City, and The Face of The Joker is always smiling. It is almost as is Christopher Nolan cherry picked all of the best elements from The Batman backlog, I include the previous movie, The Burton years, Adam West era etc, and forged together something quite incredible, making not just The best Batman movie of all time, but arguably one of the greatest movies of all time. Two and a half magical hours, this film excels in every conceivable field, it is wonderfully dark, atmospheric and moody, but in equal measures it is exciting, action packed and dynamic. The story couldn't be better, it's so good, it'll appeal to those that don't even enjoy superhero movies, it really is that good. Packed with incredible action scenes, it's visually awesome. Christian Bale is once again fabulous, this Batman is a little petulant, a little impatient, but wonderfully intense. What every hero needs though, is a villain, and what takes this film up another level, is Heath Ledger, who's remarkable performance is nothing short of astonishing. An incredible supporting cast once again, Caine and Freeman once again show why they're Hollywood royalty. Superior to pretty much everything else. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0468569
"Without doubt the most well known and respected of all the modern serial killer films, and with good reason. While most point to the acting of both Hopkins and Foster as the main strength, the script is also very well written for the screen, and the entire atmosphere, well chosen music, and suspenseful pacing provided by director Jonathan Demme is nothing short of fantastic. To me it is really Demme's work here that separates this film from the pack. Anyway you slice it, you must see this monster if you're interested in serial killer films much at all. I saw it in the theatre during it's original run, as many did. In fact at the time, Silence set an all time box office record for an R rated film. 8.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0102926
"For a long time, The Dark Knight was my favorite movie, but it's been over a year since I've last seen it. I decided it was time for a rewatch. This is the sequel to Batman Begins and serves as the second installment in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy. First of all, there were three problems I had with Batman Begins all of which were fixed in this film. I didn't like the style of Batman Begins's Gotham, as it felt like a cross between realistic and stylized. In The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan fixes this and makes everything as realistic as possible, making everything really great. The second problem that was fixed was Racheal. In the last film, she was played by Katie Holmes who just didn't do a good job. In this film, she was recast and is now played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who delivers a very solid performance. The third problem that was fixed was the action. Batman Begins had poorly edited action where you could barely see, and in this film it's greatly improved. It's all really well choreographed and overall a big step up from the last film. As I mentioned earlier, this film has a very realistic setting, and that creates some phenomenal visuals. The visual effects in this film are so, *so* good. Almost every time you see an explosion or some car being flipped over, I just want you to realize that that is probably real. The amount of huge explosions and stunts they did for real just so that it looked good in the film is amazing. The cinematography is truly stunning, mixed with the fact this film has sequences shot on IMAX cameras (although not nearly as much as Christopher Nolan's later films), and it just looks absolutely stunning each and every time. Some people get really bothered by the switching aspect ratios, but honestly I think it's done in the perfect moments and although I do notice it it doesn't bother me that much. There are so many iconic shots in here, and it's mixed with the fantastic editing. Hans Zimmer's score is a huge step up from Batman Begins delivering one of the most iconic film scores of all time with this film. It elevates each and every scene, and it's made even better by the choices of when to NOT use music. The sound mixing is really fantastic overall. Now, I do have a problem here, and it's that I think the pacing is a little unsteady. The film really gets better as it goes on, but the first act focuses almost exclusively on the mob and the slide plot with Lau with the ""supervillains"" not getting lots of screen time until later in the film. I feel that a lot of this stuff with the mob just wasn't as interesting as everything else. It could've either been cut, shortened, or more evenly dispersed throughout the film's runtime. Speaking of villains, this film has Heath Ledger as the Joker giving one of the greatest performances of all time. The entire cast of this film is stellar, Aaron Eckhart is absolutely fantastic as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman delivers a really solid Gordon, and Micheal Caine and Morgan Freeman play great parts in their roles. Moving on to what I like about the plot, I think this film just has some fantastic themes. It's a superhero movie but has some really complex moral dedications made and absolutely fantastic themes presented once we reach the halfway mark. To this day, I don't think I've seen a superhero film successfully pull off themes as big as this. Now, for as many years as I can remember The Dark Knight was my favorite movie of all time. In recent months, I started to get a little shaky on that claim, and after watching The Matrix for the first time I declared that to be my new favorite movie. So the question is: after rewatching The Dark Knight, is it my favorite movie? The answer is no. Like I said, I've had to have seen this movie around 15 times, and after seeing something that many times a lot of the flaws become more apparent, and I can see it's not perfect. It's not about the suspense and tension, all of that is gone, you look at the film through a more objective lense. This is why The Matrix is my favorite film, because I've only seen it once, and because that perfect momentum, mystery, tension, and the incredible thrills were all there and are still fresh in my mind. I'm sure in the years to come I will watch The Matrix many many times, and I'm sure I will soon start to see the flaws and the mystery and suspense will fade from my memory. What it will come down to is what film means the most to me. As much as I loved The Matrix, out of all the films I've seen, I can't say it affected me on a personal level. It just had unparalleled suspense and momentum which will disappear in the rewatches for years to come. The lore won't change, the structure won't change, and I have no doubt I will still love the film, but I don't know that it will be remembered for personally affecting me. The Dark Knight, a superhero movie, has affected me in more ways than I can begin to describe. The Dark Knight is one of the few pieces of media, up there with Minecraft, where I literally cannot imagine where I would be without it. The Dark Knight got me into superheroes, it got me into comic books, and it got me into fiction. I've said before that despite only getting into film recently, I've been developing my own story ideas for years. Those ideas wouldn't be here without this film. The Dark Knight has had such a large influence on who I am, and even a large influence on what I believe. The themes about morality, justice, and Batman as a symbol had such a large impact on me that I really don't know where I would be without it. Not to mention it starting my love for superheroes, which still continues to this day. At the end of the day, The Dark Knight is personal to me while The Matrix is not. I love both, but one I love like a new Christmas present I just got and the other I love like a stuffed animal I've had since I was an infant. Thank you to Christopher Nolan, Jonathon Nolan, and David S. Goyer. You have created an everlasting masterpiece, a film that transcended film and affected me in more ways than I can describe, and a symbol as powerful as Batman himself. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0468569

It lures you in but never manages to hook you. They shouldve explored other characters rather than Cobb. It seems to me as though the film could've been pulled off with a less talented supporting cast. Also it is slightly confusing in some parts. Other parts are way too predictable.

"Whenever I talk about different years in movies, I always pick 1999 as my favourite year. So many amazing films came out such as American Beauty, The Green Mile, The Matrix and Being John Malkovich. Out of every movie that came out this year, one stands out for me and that is Fight Club. The first time I ever watched this movie was really late at night and I had waited for it to come on T.V and had to wait until everyone was asleep. I was in absolute awe over the sheer brilliance of the film. everything about it is amazing. The first thing I noticed was the cinematography. Every time I watch this movie, the opening shot gets me excited and ready for a powerful film. The story itself is so interesting, it doesn't have any dull moments. Even when a character's life is portrayed as boring you are just hooked in wanting to see what will happened next. The way the story develops also is very fascinating. Then we have wonderful performances from both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. But I think that the real standout here is Helena Bonham Carter. She plays one of the only female characters in the movie and truly makes you think about everything in the movie. There is one negative point though, the fact that a few scenes feel random and tacked on, along with some plot holes. Overall, if you haven't checked this out, this is a must for every person as long as you aren't squeamish. Rating: 6.8/7 (or 9/10)",positive,9,tt0137523
"As soon as I saw that the film was in black and white and that it lasted 3 hours, I knew that it was not for me. I watched the whole movie several times. For the first half, I didn't understand what was happening, so I was also bored (not all the time). It is so realistic that one would say that they really committed genocide for the purposes of the film. It is so painful to watch Jews being killed, or when they were burned at the stake. In the last hour of the movie, I figured everything out. It was so sad, but also interesting because otherwise I love movies on that topic. If they had shortened the first two hours of the film, it would definitely have been more than 6/10. Although, objectively, it is definitely for more than 6. If you had asked me in the first half of the film whether such a film deserves to be in the top 5 films of all time, I would have said definitely no. But after the second half, definitely yes. So my opinion on this is ultimately divided. P. S. It's possible that I didn't understand part of the movie because I watched it in several parts, and the last hour of the movie all at once. Also, I didn't quite figure out the part with the girl in the red dress and what she actually has to do with the film, that is why she is so important for the whole film.",neutral,6,tt0108052
"I'll give nothing away which you can't already know from reading the promotional blurb to this movie. And still, this movie really stands as an insult to one's intelligence. So, let's again examine what this movie is about.. Well it is indeed (as you know already from reading its promo material) loosely based upon your standard vigilante ""Death Wish"" (from 1974) formula. Accordingly, do you sincerely expect to see a nasty bad guy who does bad? Do you sincerely expect to see a handsome good guy who does bad in revenge? Do you accordingly expect to witness a nasty bad guy who does bad more than once? Do you expect our vigilante to give up easily? And what about all those beautiful actresses who were just innocently standing around Mr. Jee Woo Kim's film sets? Nice girls... Well, if you don't think you know the answers to such questions, you'll just have to watch the movie to find out. Won't you? Albeit, I would advise as follows, if you are of any sensibly intellectual disposition. Let's just say, without giving anything away, that nothing in this movie surprised me - save for the fact that this reviewer expected a lot more from this director, than this unintelligent drivel, which could only appeal to society's lowest common denominator: Violence addicts may, that is to say, love this movie. Anyway, the leading girls were very pretty. The bad guy antagonist was very nasty. The handsome vigilante protagonist, Byung-hun Lee, is one of South Korea's very best known stars. And in his other movies you can see for yourselves that he is, quite usually, a very talented actor. But alas, if you've seen one ""Death Wish"", you've (...even if this is in a slickly updated Korean based production) seen 'em all... Quite honestly, this was a pathetically 'low brow', waste of production and directing talent. 3/10, unless your IQ is under 110 - in which case it's a must see 'gore fest'!

"I personally think that Brad Pitt is under-rated as an actor. He is considered a pretty boy in Hollywood. But if you took a moment and went over all of his films, he never really has done, accept several, pretty boy movies. He is personally one of my favorite actors. If you don't believe me I think you should sit down and watch several of his films, especially this one. I could never picture Freddie Prinze Jr. or anybody else ever daring to take on this kind of role. That is why I refuse to sit down and watch those sort of films. I do not like to waste my money. The plot is very basic. Morgan Freeman is a week from retirement. Brad Pitt is the new guy in town. They both team up to catch a serial killer who kills people by the seven deadly sins. You can always count on Morgan Freeman to be brilliant. I have yet to see him in a project he looks bad in. But I must say, since this film he seems to be only taking the smart-detective role, accept for ""Nurse Betty"". Brad Pitt is wonderful in his role. He portrays a man who is dedicated to both his family and his work. Though he isn't anywhere near as smart as Somerset, he certainly trys. In a funny scene, Somerset travels to the library to read up on the sins. Mills mearly settles for the cliff notes of the sins. A must see for all fans of the film is the newly released DVD. It is filled with tons of extras and some great deleted scenes that could have been kept in the film. Overall it is a masterful film and an ending that needs to be seen to be believed. I very highly recommend the film.  9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0114369

BUT the rest of the movie, the plot etc. is only average and what you could expect. I went to a mid-day play and halfway through the movie i was almost about to catch a nap.. i was NOT especially tired when entering the cinema.

"American History X is one of the saddest, one of the most moral and definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. Everything, from the subject of the movie, to the actors is nearing perfection(as we know: nothing's and no one's perfect beside God). The actual fact, that the movie's theme is as real as it can get is a strong point. These are things which probably are still happening everywhere. It doesn't matter if it's black, yellow or red. It happens everywhere.    Unfortunately, the brilliance of this movie seems to not have been understood or accepted by some people, and I'm thinking especially about the people who award the well known Academy Awards. But, let's be serious: does a movie have to be recognized by a hand of people to be good? From the beginning to the end of the movie you shall feel the intensity of the things that are happening. You shall tremble, and you shall fear. You shall think and you shall see, that maybe you know these things. Or, maybe not. It's a thrilling walk, through our present world. It's something you might not understand. It's something you might not accept. It's that fact that some people do think the way it's presented in the movie. Maybe one of those is reading this. I'm sure that those people will say the movie sucked. And maybe it did for them. You can choose to either be as blind as.or to be as open minded as  Derek. It's your choice. And whatever you will do, you will have to say it before God. Of course, for these people the only problem is: God does not exist. As proven, it's not a lost cause, and you can always turn around. There's one point of view out of which I fear this movie probably failed. If it's only purpose was to entertain, then it's merits are sky high. But, if it had the objective to change the way some people are thinking, I doubt it succeeded. That's what I believe. Sadly, the movie only repeats the things most of the people know. It can be less impressive for some, out of a simple reason: It shows you reality, a reality in which you live in, but a reality which you already know. Or think you know. The fact that at the end Danny dies, killed by a black kid will leave a big question open: what will Derek do? What will he do now, after his second relative is killed by a black personhe might turn back to his old waysit remains an open question, and the answer will depend on each persons character. I myself, believe that he shall not stray on the wrong path again. Despite that fact that all you learn, can be unlearned, I think that after the lesson he got in prison, he will not waste his life without doing anything good for him, his family, or any other person. Now to the cinematic part. I think Edward Norton was simply amazing! He fit so well in his role and he acted so flawlessly that he would have deserved a tiny, tiny bit of the Oscar. Of course, Roberto Benigni's acting was as good as Norton's, and it's very hard for me to choose a winner. I would go though on Benigni, because I have a good feeling when American awards are handed over to non English speaking people. I mean people who don't have English as their native language of course. Norton though is one of the actors which will have( if you don't want to say he already has) a shining career as an actor.        Edward Furlong showed some impressive skills, and surely deserves to be called a great hope of modern cinematography.        I would like to end the review here, because there isn't much more to say to it. This movie should be seen without hesitation by everyone, because it can be a lesson. And I ask, can a movie be brilliant if it doesn't effect the viewers' lives?    Rating? 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0120586
"No matter what you think 'defines' ""Star Wars""- the action sequences, the detailed and enthralling mythos, the memorable characters, the romance, or just the atmosphere of adventure, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is in just about every way the most rewarding viewing experience out of any of the six live action ""Star Wars"" films (I have not seen ""Clone Wars"" and don't intend to right now). Why? Because it pulls off what ""Revenge of the Sith"" failed at: creating a compelling and well-written character-driven story while still delivering plenty of action, humor, and remaining an homage to the serials of the 1930's and 40's. It's surprising that there remains debate over how right or wrong critics were on the film at the time of its release, when it received not negative nor very positive reviews, but mixed ones leaning towards the positive side, generally. Few critics initially recognized the superiority of this screenplay to the first film in the series, and not only its relative complexity but its richness in its allusions to and utilization of literature and films of the past to create its own unique mythos. It's hardly surprising, given that Leigh Brackett was involved in writing the screenplay, some of her greatest achievements in her film career being ""The Big Sleep"", ""The Long Goodbye"", and ""Rio Bravo"", all rich, detailed, and intelligent screenplays. Yes, attempting to argue that ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is an intelligent character-based film is fast becoming pointless; you're either preaching to the choir or attempting to convince those with the prequels fresh in their mind that ""Star Wars"" was, once upon a time, a franchise worthy of real praise. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" really does tell a compelling story, however, and it is compelling mostly because we really do care about Luke's journey, we do care about Han Solo, we love Chewie, we adore the banter between R2-D2 and C-3PO, and arguably most of all because Darth Vader isn't just a 'cool' villain, he's a genuinely interesting and compelling character (er, if you can keep Hayden Christensen out of mind). Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett have achieved something rare and special here, a grand Hollywood spectacle which can be analyzed and discussed at great length (which I'm definitely not going to do, if you're interested pick up one of the dozens, hundreds possibly, of books written on the subject, or just do a quick Google search) . It's a great screenplay. Not that there haven't been great screenplays let down by incompetent film-making in the past, but ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is certainly not an example of this. I'm sure ""Star Wars"" fans know much more about the making of this film and how much credit Irvin Kershner deserves for the end result than I do, but for this review I'll credit him with the quality of this film on a technical level. It's an improvement over the first film in many ways, as far as I'm concerned, especially the set design (which is more ambitious here), and the quality of the visuals and even the acting. ""Star Wars"" may have an opening scene and shot which remains magical to this day, but I'd argue that most of this film is memorable and enthralling, with only one or two scenes in the first half hour or so being just 'good'. The acting also improves notably, with the exception of Carrie Fisher (who really just isn't a good actor), Mark Hamill is arguably the most improved since the first film, really coming into his own as Luke Skywalker here, and even giving us one of cinema's few good 'NOOO!!!' moments. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" also introduces us to Yoda, of course, and I'm really surprised at how animated and expressive Yoda is (being, I'm pretty sure, a puppet at this point). The special effects in general are outstanding, outside of a couple of the creatures near the beginning of the film. It's not just that ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is an enthralling and exciting film, and an iconic one at that, but it really does work on a deeper level. No, I'm not saying that ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is some sort of immeasurably complex and subtle film, but what's impressive about it is that it offers spectacle and humor, but is also a genuinely compelling tale driven by its characters, primarily Luke. It's a great, great movie, and where ""Star Wars"" may fall just short of deserving the sort of praise it gets, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" really is a terrific movie and deserves all the praise it has received and will receive in the future. 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0080684

"Okay, so i just met the Spartans and it wasn't pretty. It was better than both Date Movie and Epic Movie but that isn't hard to do. This was full of terrible jokes and dance battles and it only managed to have a few scenes that raised a laugh from me. So i recommend you never meet the Spartans. If you hate jokes that go on and on then this isn't the movie for you. This movie was full of it. Seltzer and Friedberg still can't manage to make a spoof movie that is funnier than the Scary Movie series. I still hate your movies Seltzer and Friedberg but this was a step forward.

"I had heard of it, but was never really intrigued enough to go out and watch The Omen. But when the remake was announced, I became interested, and even more so as the mythical 6/6/06 day was arriving. So in special ""celebration"" (not the right word, I know) of that day, I purchased up the original and watched it. While I was not terribly disappointed, I was not entirely impressed either. Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is an American Ambassador in Italy, whose wife Katherine (Lee Remick) has given birth to a stillborn baby, on June 6 at 6 A.M.. For the sake of his wife, Robert goes to an orphanage and adopts a new born child, who he brings to his wife, without ever telling her of the tragic death. They name him Damien, and soon after, the Thorns are moved to Britain. As Damien's fifth birthday comes though, a bizarre death occurs at his party, and even stranger things begin to happen soon afterwards, leading Robert to start believing that his son may be the Anti-Christ. While the film is not particularly scary, it is fairly tense. As the film goes along and the death toll rises, you cannot help but start believing what is going on is much more real than it may seem. Just the idea of the devil being born again in the body of a child is terrifying enough. And as a result, Richard Donner's production performs well, even thirty years later. David Seltzer's screenplay is well versed and well written. Even though you can predict what's coming, the writing is still very well done and well communicated. Jerry Goldsmith's score holds up well, if a little more dramatic than it should be. Peck is great as Robert, always questioning, and never truly knowing the truth. When emotional moments come however, his acting is not as reciprocal as it should be. But this is a great actor here, and he handles the material well, and never really messes it up. Remick is not bad, but falls to the wayside about halfway through, in order for Robert's investigation to really take hold of the film. David Warner does a great supporting turn as the photographer Keith Jennings, and for his short role, Patrick Troughton does great as Father Brennan. If I was disappointed at all with the cast, it would be the fact that Harvey Stephens' Damien and Billie Whitelaw's much discussed Mrs. Baylock are barely in the film. These are two of the creepiest characters in the horror/suspense genre, and they barely have any chances to show why. Of course, when they are on screen, they are fabulous, but those moments only come so few and far between the main story. If the film has anything wrong with it, it's the fact that there is so much in it, that it feels overly long (even at one hundred and eleven minutes). The film is totally interesting for the first half, but begins to get bogged down by a ton of exposition by the beginning of the second half. It drags out, and what should feel really shocking, really feels boring. Yes, the many moments that are supposed to strike us as horrific, do strike us that way. But the time that the film takes to get to it's eventual conclusion is really long. And even with the exposition, there are still way too questionable moments that are left unanswered. The film holds up and is very well made, but it could have used a bit of extra editing. The entire thing is very interesting, but some may get turned off by how strikingly boring the film becomes. I could only wish there was much more of Mrs. Baylock and Damien in the film too. 7.5/10. (An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",neutral,5,tt0075005
"""Every mind has billions of ideas and each one of us do things that no one expects us to do, some of those things are visible, some not but one of those things that make our life worth living is FREEDOM"" Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a young man who faces a long, long time in prison after he is wrongfully found guilty of murdering his wife and her lover. While inside he learns an awful lot about what a man can hold onto and let himself be put through if there is still an ounce of hope in his soul. Bottles of cool drink on a hot rooftop, a slowly building library collection, the moment of musical joy that sees Dufresne severely punished for his overstepping of the mark and many other scenes spring to mind as classic moments in a movie almost chock full of classic moments. Andy quickly gets befriended by ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), actually the narrator of the story, both soon prove that even in the worst circumstances, within the ""hell on earth"" they can maintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom... Morgan Freeman is the film's secret strength, playing ""the guy who can get it for you"" with a note of welcome ambiguity. Watching him in an early scene, when a fat, new convict (fresh fish) is being beaten by cruel head guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), you don't know whether Red looks so crestfallen for the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he just lost betting the guy wouldn't break before Dufresne James Whitmore was equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole following a 50 year stint. This shows that people who have been incarcerated for such a long period, need some sort of readjustment training before they rejoin society. For Whitmore, freedom meant ultimate doom, making the scene one of my all-time favorite displaying the ultimate dark side and a certain fear in freedom. Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman along with James Whitmore etched unforgettable performances as prisoners charged with crime. The film shows what prison life is all about. Subjects dealing with prison survival, brutality, corruption and ultimate redemption are well shown. An outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners. Many social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a well-deserved best picture Oscar nomination. It certainly should have tied with the winner, the equally good ""Forrest Gump.""

"Car chases are about the coolest stunt in an action movie. To my latest count, The Transporter had three. Frank (Jason Statham) is a transporter: he delievers packages from one bad guy to the next, no questions asked. Or he may even carry passangers, as seen from the first scene. But when he opens a package that seems to be moving and screaming, things start to turn to the worse. Soon everybody is trailing Frank and trying to kill him. Just an ordiniary day in the life of a transporter. The opening car chase scene is the coolest one I've ever seen in movies. Sure it's unlikely (nay...impossible), but this movie isn't about what can happen in real life. The subsequent chases pale in comparision, but are still pretty cool. The plot, however, is anything but cool. In the first half, the plot was the consequence of opening the package. In the second half, it's about 400 Asian immigrants and the girl (Qi Shu) from the package's father working for the bad guy. Or something like that. Action movies like this are supposed to have you not really think about anything except for basic plot and explosions (like the one at the rest stop...awesome!), but you had to follow the plot or else you wouldn't understand what was happening. The best non-car-chase fight sequence was in the bus station. Buses...$35,000. Fighting ten guys on an oiled floor...priceless. At some times, Statham's moves seemed like he was break-dancing. Speaking of Statham, he could be the next action hero. With his Bond-like stunts and his Diesel-like build, move over Brosnan! There's a new hero in town. Shu was good as a girl with tape over her mouth, but she soon became an obnoxious person who wasn't fun to be with. Shu, and almost everyone else in the movie, had accents that were hard to understand a lot of times. If they learned anything from The Osbournes, it is that they can put subtitles in English-it'll help! The music was right on-key, helping tense the situation and then relax us, and then tense us up again. In the beginning, the sound FX really helped to bring out the quality of the sound. Music can be obnoxious if used in the wrong places, but in some places, like The Transporter, it helps bring out the mood. The bad guys, on the con side of the film, were so one-dimensional that they must have aced Stupid Bad Guys 101. On the test: Question 1: True or False: When the person you're supposed to kill disappears, just assume that he died. They must of tried to kill him and ""succeeded"" three times. What a load of idiots. And some of the film was so utterly unbelieveable. Statham just knows how to scuba-dive, parachute, has a giant house with an underwater passage to another house connected to it and has a million Mercedeses. Right... Well, enough of my mumbo-jumbo. If you just skipped down here to have me cut to the chase, here it is: Fun, mucho action, and some awesome chases counter against one-dimensional bad guys and horrible plot. I'm not sure if I recommend it or not, I guess just see it for yourself to figure it out. My rating: 6/10 Rated PG-13 for strong action violence and some language.",neutral,6,tt0293662
"This movie is worth 3/10 to me not because is disgusting or anything like that. It's a movie and everything can be done. This is 3/10 because you have everything in there to be a poor movie. Very bad acting. Most probably the asian guy swearing is the best acting in this movie. All the rest of the cast deliver nothing. Alongside with the very bad writing and the usual stupid decisions so they can take the story where they would like too. Typical for low budget and poor scenario. Instead for thinking something smarter to write, it's better to just write the stupidest decisions for the characters so the story can move on. If you read the 2 line plot summary or watch the trailer, you have watched the movie. As an idea for the disgusting horror/thriller/splatter movie, I have no problem watching it with better story and better acting.",negative,3,tt1467304
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is without a doubt one of the best films of the 90's and one of the best prison dramas of all time. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" can go head to head with any great movie of the 90's and probably win. The plot is airtight with only one or two mistakes through the whole film, not a lot of films could say the with even the likes of Forrest Gump, Titanic and Unforgiven have mistakes in them. One thing that Darabont does better than any director i've seen in a long time is pace every scene perfectly. Another great thing about this film is the pitch perfect cast. Tim Robbins puts in the best performance of his career, even topping his role in ""The Player"" and Morgan Freeman is outstanding as ""Red"" Redding and old tymer who knows everything and has seen everything about jail. Bob Gunton is also brilliant as the evil sheriff putting in his best performance. But the most underrated performance in my opinion is the one put in by James Whitmore as ""Brooks"". Eventhough ""The Shawshank Redemption"" may seem like a tear jerker or like a tragic drama by the end you will have a smile on your face . I won't ruin it for you but the ending is one of the best I have ever seen, only rivaled by the unexpected twist in ""The Usual Suspects"". So if you want to feel some emotion, be surprised and enlightened or just plainly watch a great movie rent ""The Shawshank Redemption"". 10/10 Near Perfect Movie",positive,10,tt0111161
"I don't live in the States, so by the time Gladiator got here, I had a fair idea of what to expect - an impressive, well acted, well directed historical spectacle. And since Russell Crowe is had impressed me in the past, I went and saw it. About five minutes in I got a strange feeling that I'll end up disagreeing with the reviews. Wow, did I ever. Let's start with the acting: inconsistent best describes it. Crowe was good, though not up to his L.A Confidential and Insider standard. Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed turned in decent performances as well. Joaquin Pheonix overacted a bit but for the most part I thought he did an okay job. Richard Harris was ridiculous and Connie Nielsen was very pretty, but calling what she did acting would be a stretch. The kid was very annoying. Now, the other problems: Many sequences in the movie were so dark I couldn't see the actors' faces. Obviously not a good thing. Is this meant to convey the darkness of Maximus's predicament? The oppressiveness of the Roman Empire? The treachery of Commodus? I wonder... Still, the biggest problem was the screenplay. A lot of the dialog was plain silly, and I spent much of the movie wondering what motivated some of the characters. The whole thing seemed horribly one dimensional and contrived. Maybe it's just me? Well, I went with four friends, all of us with very different tastes. None of us enjoyed Gladiator, and I think my friend summed it up best when she said she was very impressed, but she doesn't think she liked it. Despite my rather negative opinion, I'm going with a 5/10 on account of the movie's better performances and some nice cinematography. But as for Crowe films, I'll take L.A Confidential any day.",neutral,5,tt0172495
"I would give the film a 8.5/10 but it comes with a warning of advice.  For people that have not read the book the viewing can be a very challenging task that demands careful attention and repeated viewings.  I personally found it hard to remember the characters names, the places, and even to figure out which hobbit is which, or even which wizard is which.  I also found it hard to understand the thick ""Middle Earth"" accent.  Why does everyone's name sound the same? Sadly, I don't think that this movie can be enjoyed if you were just a casual fan who saw the first film a year ago.  In order to fully understand this film, it is necessary to watch perhaps 2 or 3 times or with the captions on, and have a ring guru nearby so you can ask lots of questions.  ""Who's that? What did he just say?""  There is simply too much going on for our ADD/ADHD society to engulf, or even me and I consider myself an intelligent college educated person. However, after working really hard, I eventually did understand and appreciate this as a spectacular film and story.  I just don't think it classifies so much as a movie - it really is in its own category.  A movie you should be able to go to without knowing anything about it, sit down and let the movie take you to its world and let you leave 2- 2.5 hours later with some token impact.  A movie should be able to give you all you need such that you can take whatever you need from it in one sitting.  The ring ""films"" don't do that with me.  That is my caution.",neutral,5,tt0167261
"Sorry to whoever thinks this movie is the best movie of all time, but I found a lot of it to be dull. The first hour and a half were so boring I was ready to walk out. Batman himself was literally like nothing but a black piece of cardboard that walks around and says ""Stop bad person!"" every time a crime happens. The Dark Knight proves that Batman really is the crown jewel of flat, cliché characters devoid of any personality whatsoever. Add the hour of boring, pointless conversations that is all that makes up the first hour, and The Dark Knight seems just like every other lame action movie. Maybe in the end it really is nothing but a lame action movie, but one factor kills that and raises my score from a ""Meh, whatever . . ."" to a ""That was pretty nifty!"": Heath Ledger as Joker. I've seen a lot of action and horror movies in my life, and I can guarantee I've seen just about every villain who was worth watching. On one website I was on, people were even debating if Hannibal Lector was better than Joker, to which all I can say is: Hannibal is an emo pretty boy who would have turned out fine if he got more attention from his mother, but Joker is the real deal. Joker doesn't have any cliché motives, he's a complete nihilist, and Heath Ledger plays him to such an amazing degree it's scary. If this movie had have been allowed an R-rating, and Joker's carnage could have been fully shown on screen with blood, he would have almost too godly for my mind to process. Joker is flawless, and puts every single villain I have ever seen to shame. Sadly, as I said in my first paragraph, the rest of the movie doesn't follow that example of perfection. Every other character was dull and uninspired, and used for no other reason to fill the screen with an hour and a half of pointless talking scenes about the plot that we've known since the first trailer. I've said it before and I'll say it again: ACTION movies do not need CONVERSATION about what is going on. The audience knows what is going ongive us at least that much credit. Conversation BORES us, and if directors don't stop using it so copiously, we'll stop giving them our MONEY. That's why The Dark Knight was so dull: conversation between boring characters that amounts to nothing. If they had taken that out, I would have given this a perfect 10 and seen the movie five times just to support a director who understands his audience. The good. The plotting was great, Joker was godly, a lot of the decisions the characters made flew in the face of the obvious clichés, there was a lot of diversity in scenery, the action was godly, and the morality wasn't cliché and actually had a decent point that could be applied to everyday life. This is something that has always annoyed me about movies with social commentaries/morals: they're never something you can apply to your life. Either their something cliché like No Country for Old Men's pathetic, ""We all die!"" or just impractical like Sweeny Todd's, ""Don't kill people or you'll end up dead!"" The Dark Knight is more intelligent that than, and uses its morality in a way that is left up the viewer to decide/think through. Directors/writers, please take note. Overall, some of the action scenes were some of the best I've ever seen in my life. The main problem with The Dark Knight, however, is how dull it is at times. When you try to take something childish and make it dark and mature, it almost will always end up dull, and it's sad that the director/writer didn't notice this. But everything bad I said just pales when I think of how cool Joker was, or how amazing some of the action scenes were. I can forget I just sat through a boring hour of talking. I can forget Batman is a cliché, pointless character. If I were to focus on those things I'd be looking at the movie the wrong way. This is Joker's movie. And, dear God, he puts on a good show. 7/10",positive,7,tt0468569
"This is obviously nothing but a T&A flick. To the people who don't know what that means, it's short for ""tits and ass"". And that is what you get in this film, tits and ass, and virtually nothing else. The acting is bad, apart from a few performances which are decent at best. The plot is poorly put together and almost entirely pushed into the background to show the viewer nudity, instead of actual film. I suppose there needs to be some T&A flicks every now and then, but this is too long, pointless, and has too little sex and nudity. I guess Paul Verhoeven set out to make a T&A flick, and either didn't know exactly how to do it and figured he'd inject some plot too, or he felt it would be too empty with only nudity. The result is too boring for fans of T&A flicks, and too simple for anyone else. The problem is, we don't care about any of the characters; we just want one of two things: to see them naked, or to have the film move on and be more entertaining. Unfortunately, neither is done to the point of satisfaction. There is too little nudity and sex in the film, and too many badly developed, boring and pointless characters. The film has some decent nudity and sex scenes, but they are too far apart and the film is far too long. It would have been better had it just been 90 minutes, and nothing but T&A, instead of trying to make it watchable to people who want more than just nudity. I liked a few of the scenes that involved nudity and/or sex, and I enjoyed one of the last scenes which has the main character taking the law into her own hands, but apart from that, this is pointless. I recommend this only to fans of T&A flicks, and possibly fans of Verhoeven(even though this is his worst film, he even admitted that himself). 2/10",negative,2,tt0114436
"I was literally HOOKED. No wonder this film is rated amongst the best ever. This is definitely one of the best movies you will see your entire life. Morgan Freeman's narration was awesome. Tim Robbins powerfully illustrates the importance of HOPE. All the characters did a superb job. This is surely one of my all time favourite movies. Its a classic & a true masterpiece of cinema... Don't think! Just watch & savour it. I saw the following comment by someone and thought of adding it to mine, I agree 100% to everything of the following: ""Many people in this world are unhappy. Most people in this world don't want to be unhappy. Lots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once and for all. They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state, while they suffer. To borrow the words of another film, they're watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow. Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist. They're not destined to join the bluebirds and fairy tales don't come true. It's not that no one lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to. They're busy dying. In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this fairytale, magic wands exist. And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini. However this film is not about him. Neither is it about the prison, the governor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, the script, the direction or the score. It's about Red. He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's not only trapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him, he couldn't cope. He's safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going. Hope is, as Red say, dangerous. The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it. A large proportion of those don't understand what's wrong, but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer. Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely don't understand what's going on in those who do. They're too busy living."" Just a little piece of advice to everyone who hated/disliked this film; Believe me this film is made for multiple viewings...Don't hate this after viewing it once or twice, give it at least more than 2 viewings before you make up your mind. I'm POSITIVE it will become more and more better after each viewing and probably you will end up loving it. If not, maybe it was just not your Cup Of Tea. I hope this film satisfies everyone and I really don't care if its No.1 on the IMDb or outside Top250. Its not fair to hate a film because your favourite is not above it in the rankings! Its a deeply satisfying movie that makes you understand the importance of HOPE. 9.8/10 P.S. Technically{all round film-making} it may not be the greatest movie of all-time{that honor can go to Godfather/LOTR:ROTK/Star Wars 4,etc.} BUT it certainly goes down in my book as one of the finest and a movie to savour for ages.",positive,8,tt0111161
"The first act has the sweetness of disney movies, except it didn't reach the same level of charm of disney movies due to the overly clumsy dialogue, and the fact that the first act is very long. But I didn't mind that, or rather this isn't my main issue which is the second act and most of the third act are way more serious, because this is when the tone of the movie changed to be dark comedy, and that, of course, made the movie inconsistent in tone. Nevertheless, the movie became way more powerful as a dark comedy, and allows Benigni's clever and deft direction, and Oscar-winning performance, to shine even more. This is when the movie tug at my heartstrings, and became very devastating till its end that is as sweet as a disney movie as it is wrenching as a usual holocaust movie.

Firstly; i'd like to make it clear to any avid film-goer - avoid this film like the plague. If you're into the whole ""making ill-thought CGI exploison after exploison"" thing, this is probably your cup of tea. I could barely watch the film without the persistent thought in my mind that it had absolutely nothing to do with Die Hard franchise, instead, it seems to just be another run-of-the-mill trashy Hollywood (note the decapitalization)revamp which adheres not even remotely to the original plot nor characters. To be fair, I'm sure the name of the film only includes the words ""Die"" and ""Hard"" so it would line the pockets of the higher-uppers. In fact, on second thought - I'm not even sure WHY i'm writing this review. It's so disgustingly bad i'm not even sure it deserves any literary response, let alone any positive emotional response. In fact, I urge all of you to go see this movie, you can only truly appreciate how appalling this film is if you see it with your own eyes. I'm not even sure that if I was to write an in-depth review, that I would be able to exude just how poor a sequel it is. 1/10 - it doesn't even deserve the 1.

"So i just voted the Godfather 7/10.  But when I had to summarize it in that one line, i just couldn't do it.  It's impossible.  The movie has been so tainted and vandalized in the industry that it seems that it's impossible for one to point a finger on just exactly how they feel. Simply put: the Godfather is a good, solid, 3 star (out of four) movie. Yes, the experienced may have been ruined for me (i first saw it with a cold and didn't like it, so i had to see it later, as i knew something was wrong).  I also may be too young (all the commenters say you have to be over 18.  i say you could see the movie at ten and over).  But i feel the movie is a well written, well acted, well balanced movie. What's the problem?  Again, I'm speechless.  It lacks a kick, that special kick that so many movies need to have.  Unlike its outstanding sequel, it fails to generate the feeling that the viewer is wrapped in it like a blanket, with the exception of a few scenes.  it best serves as an introduction to a legendary trilogy, rather than just a movie. Brando shines as a role that seems written for him, Pacino is great, Caan is head to head with his performance here and with his performance in the gripping Misery (3 1/2 stars out of four).  The script has some of the most realistic writing ever written.  It simply lacks the kick. If a person walked up to me and asked if they should see it, i would probably slap them in the face, ask what's wrong with them, and steal their lunch money.  But I would also tell them that before they see it, they should be ready to form their own opinion.  Now we come to the ""how it was ruined"" part. Hollywood generated and ego for this movie.  if you don't like it, or even have a positive opinion like me, you're automatically not considered a movie buff.  I applaud (and send my heart out to) all the movie buffs on imdb that get up off the ground, brush it off, lick their wounds, and say, ""look punk, i didn't like it.""  It's important to form your own opinion, and i'm sure that there are plenty of people that go around praising this movie when they themselves don't think it was that hot.  I do, though, don't get me wrong, it was a good movie.  If you haven't seen it, i suggest you should, though, only for the sake of seeing a so called classic.

"To say this is a film solely about grown men punching one another is like saying 'Dances With Wolves' is about a bloke and his pet trying to win a weird cross-breed calypso competition, for the flick is actually a satire centred on our consumerism and commercialism consumed society with a successfully sardonic tone and a keen set of delightfully devious twists and turns, the least of which being its focal reveal which is one of the most lauded and documented twists in cinematic history but is also vastly overrated in terms of why 'Fight Club (1999)' is so successful despite it being a truly clever and revolutionary reveal. It's the taut pacing and screw-tightening screenplay that ratchets up both the tension and confusion, the perfect performances that sell the sometimes silly seeming goings-on and the perfectionist grimy direction that points the viewer in one direction while doing something vastly important in the other that all add up to make the experience a lasting and memorable one that feels as though it has something to say, gets under your skin and works on multiple viewings to equally successful effect. 8/10",positive,8,tt0137523
"Come on. This is a movie we've been anticipating for a while and we get this?. I spent 135 minutes in a dark theater. Watching this very mediocre star wars movie. Or should i say lack of star wars movie. Good casting choices, I can give it that. But barely and story and relies on action sequences. Glad to be a star wars fan but I'm not a fan of this. 5/10 can't be too harsh.",neutral,5,tt3778644
"I missed the midnight showing of the dark knight Friday, but showed up almost 2 hours early that morning to see it at 11:30 am. From the beginning of the film (I saw the first scene a few months ago, and i have been anxiously waiting to see it since) i was engrossed completely in the storyline. Christopher Nolan's direction, in my opinion, was nearly flawless, the acting, as many others have said, superb, and the visuals, amazing (the IMAX scenes especially). Heath Ledger's performance alone made this film great, his portrayal of the psychopath, the Joker, was absolutely stunning, and one of the best single performances i have ever seen. Christian Bale portrayed an excellent Bruce Wayne and Batman, by far my favorite out of any of the previous films. Even in the supporting cast, I saw no weak characters. I can't say anything bad about Morgan Freeman, whom is one of my favorite actors, and if there is any actor alive that should play Alfred, it must be Michael Caine, he was perfect in that role. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes was adequate, but not nearly as satisfying as the aforementioned performances, good nonetheless though. The run-time was long, but to me at least, not dragged out at all as there were never extended periods of time where nothing important to the storyline didn't happen. Overall, P.S. For all of the haters, I am not a ""fan-boy"" of Batman, nor do I have an unconditional love of the actors involved, or Nolan. I just wanted to say that giving the movie a 1/10 is absolutely ludicrous. Even if you did not like it at all, can you honestly put that movie in with the likes of films that actually deserve 1/10? Compare it to a truly terrible film, for example Gigli, can you tell yourself it was that bad? If you can, i just don't know what is wrong with you...",negative,1,tt0468569
"Splendid...that's the word which comes in my mind several hours after I saw 'The Dark Knight'.One will not be surprised if this film grabs this year's Oscar for the Best Film and Heath Ledger for the Best Actor.It surely is the best movie of 2008 hands down and one of the best movie of all times. Christian Bale as the protagonist suits to the role to the tee.He is vulnerable,smart,fast(has an excellent bike and Lamborghini),new gadgets and no super powers.He is by far the best Batman till date.He looks natural both as Batman and as Bruce Wayne.Aaron Eckhart is also a character to look out for in the movie.As a D.A he delivers one of his best performances ever.Maggie Gyllenhaal also enacts her role very well.Micheal Kaine is lovable as always.Morgan Freeman is well...Morgan Freeman.Gary Oldman also deserves tons of praise for playing the supporting actor.But the film belongs to only one man..'The Joker' enacted by Heath Ledger.He delivers a performance that no one will be able to erase from their memories.Truly a knockout performance.He steals each and every scene in which he is.Its sad that such a talent is no longer amongst us.He has a sense of humor and at the same time the audience will hate him for his brutality. Cinematography is awesome...Gotham never looked so pretty.The Director Christopher Nolan deserves a pat on his back for creating a masterpiece.It is a gem of a film and worth seeing at least two times.At the box office the film will break all records and set new benchmarks.The BEST movie/superhero movie ever made.

"So... people keep saying this film is magnificent and i don't find why. Characters are boring and unidimensional, special effects look horrible and the fight scenes are confusing. I don't find many good stuff in here to be honest. I like the tension that the film constructs in some scenes, just like in Moria. But other than that this film is just mediocre. If there was no continuation, this would be a 5/10, but because this film constructs to the next one, i can say is a decent introduction to the Lord of the rings trilogy. Also, Boromir is an incredibly well written character and definitively the best one on the film, but i guess that's because... spoilers i guess.",neutral,5,tt0120737
"The Godfather in one word...Perfect. This film has some of the best scenes I've seen all my life. The script is superb and the director is one of the best in the business. The actors were great and all played a vital role in this masterpiece. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino have possibly given their best performances in this film than any other they have starred in. Some people might not like this film because it's too long but I think that's sad. People like them should absolutely give this film a chance and if they still don't like it then there is something completely wrong with their taste in movies. Overall, The Godfather is an outstanding achievement of Hollywood cinema and it delivers on ALL accounts. There is nothing bad I have to say about this film. It is literally perfect.

"Seven, also known as SE7EN, is a 1995 American crime thriller directed by David Fincher and written by Andrew Kevin Walker. It stars Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey. Seven tells the story of David Mills (Pitt), a detective who partners with the retiring William Somerset (Freeman) to track down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as a motif in his murders. Seven grossed $327.3 million and currently holds a certified fresh score of 81% on Rotten Tomato's and 8.6/10 on IMDb. However, audiences enjoyed the film a lot more than critics with a 95% audience score on Rotten Tomato's, I am definitely one of those people that love this film as it engaged and intrigued me. Its hard to think of many directors that have been as consistently good as David Fincher has been over the years, with the exception of Alien 3, he's had hits such as Zodiac, The Social Network, Fight Club and Gone Girl which have all proven to be incredibly successful and beautiful to watch. Seven was David Finchers first great successes that, like his other movies, has continued to gain popularity throughout the years. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are brilliantly casted as the new up and coming detective and older detective nearing the end of his time respectively and have great chemistry together, the supporting cast is no less impressive as they all work greatly in contributing to the story. Having directed both Seven and Zodiac, David Finchers is the man to go to if you want intelligent and shocking crime thrillers. The theme of the seven deadly sins aspect of the film is a unique and interesting original approach, as it brings grim and unsettling murder scenes that interest and draws in the audience as well as repulses them with the brutal imagery and techniques that are used for each murder. With each murder also comes interesting investigating scenes that leave your heart racing at it brings itself to that ultimate heart-wrenching conclusion. Kevin Spacey's John Doe is a daunting and intimidating screen presence every time he's on screen which makes for interesting and unsettling viewing for the audience. Se7en is a psychological fabrication of thematic scope and suspenseful sequences that payed off in the mid 90s and is still revered as one of Fincher's best to this day. The dark atmosphere and unforgettable sense of mystery makes Seven a film that is still loved by the masses today.",neutral,6,tt0114369
"This Is probably the second best sequel of all time, second only to the return of the king. I've seen this movie twice in cinema this year, that's just how good it is. I could name very few flaws in this movie. This movie has some of the best preformances of all time. Heath ledgers preformance is nothing short of phenomenal and arguably the best preformance we've ever been given in a superhero film. However I believe Aaron eckhart plays his role as two-face to perfection which is severely overshadowed by Heath ledgers. Definitely one of those movies you can watch numerous times.

"I haven't seen this movie for almost three years. But every time I tell all my friends with confidence that they will not be disappointed by watching this film. And, probably, I will recommend it to everyone for many, many more years, because The Shawshank Redemption is among the first on my list of the best films. Looking at the ratings, you can say that the majority absolutely agrees with me. Director Frank Darabont did a great job, this is the best adaptation of Stephen King I've ever seen. And the actors, as the actors are selected, all, down to episodic roles, played wonderfully. And the tandem of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is a completely different story to talk about. Complementing one another, they, as a whole, were able to play on the strings of my soul a melody that I will never forget. I would like to see them together again, in a new film, in the lead roles. But, alas and ah, it seems that all this will remain only in dreams. And we are destined to enjoy their tandem only within the walls of the Shawshank prison. I think to retell and talk about the plot, I think it makes no sense, since many of you, I'm sure, have already watched this movie. Let me just talk about the finale. The first time I saw it, I just gasped. Then he looked again, and gasped again. And even when I watch it, I don't know how many times, I am again surprised that I see this film for the first time.

The atmosphere, the music, the dialogue - everything is timeless and unmatched. This movie is not just a classic; it is the pinnacle of filmmaking. A true masterpiece that will never be surpassed. It is not just a film - it's an experience that redefines what cinema can be. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0068646
"The Shawshank Redemption isn't just a movie-it's an emotional journey that teaches us about hope, resilience, and the power of friendship. Tim Robbins shines as Andy Dufresne, showing us the importance of holding onto hope, no matter how dark life gets. Morgan Freeman, as Red, delivers one of the most heartfelt performances I've ever seen, with his narration adding incredible depth to the story. The film is a masterpiece in storytelling, with every scene filled with meaning and purpose. It reminds us of the value of perseverance and kindness, inspiring us to believe that even in the worst circumstances, better days are possible. While it's nearly perfect, I feel a bit more focus on Andy's backstory could have added another layer of connection to his character. Still, this is a movie that stays with you long after the credits roll. It's a must-watch for anyone who loves powerful, life-affirming cinema. I give it a solid 9/10.",positive,9,tt0111161
"The people that don't like this generally fall into 2 groups: Those that approach it believing its central theme is fighting and those that think it is shallow and represents everything it claims to be against. 9 out of 10 people fall into the 1st category and feel let down when they realize that fighting encompasses a relatively small amount of the movie's content. They are what I classify as ""mouth breathers"" or the ""lowest common denominator"". They are incapable of ignoring their preconceived notions of the movie's theme and unable to judge the movie on what it really is. To them, it is a disappointment that they saw a completely different movie than they expected, and it is therefore sub-par in their narrow little world. The other 10% see the themes and story for what they are, but feel it's over-produced and ""too stylish"", something the movie purports to outright protest. What is lost on these poor souls is that was the exact point of why it is the way it is. It makes fun of itself, all the while protesting our modern culture. It's the ultimate self-deprecating humor. I know there are others who don't like the movie for a variety of reasons, but these are generalizations and are, therefore, generally true. There are exceptions, but these are what the majority of negative feelings for this movie encompass. To me, this movie is clever and full of great, dark humor. The violence these men engage in is the same kind of self-destructive behavior that ""cutting"" is for young women. They both feel numb to the world and cutting or fighting is the way they have chosen to ""feel"". Of course it's not a healthy way to address these emotional crises, but the movie uses it as a way of illustrating the lengths to which people sometimes go in their search for a cure to their despair. I enjoy watching this movie over and over again. It's one of the few movies that never gets boring no matter how many times I see it. 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523
"Some comic-book film adaptations are brilliantly action-packed and exciting and some are.....well......crap. The Dark Knight most definitely falls into the first of those two. Christian Bale returns as caped crusader Batman, still saving Gotham City from it's villains. But he's soon to meet his match in the form of the insane clown-faced Joker (the late Heath Ledger) who is determined to kill Batman and cause complete chaos in Gotham. The Dark Knight is set to be one of the best comic-book adaptations ever made, maybe even THE best. From the well-shot opening bank robbery scene I knew that this movie was going to be excellent and I was right. Christian Bale, Gary Oldman's and the rest of the cast's performances, although great, are completely and utterly overshadowed by the flawlessly top-notch performance from the late Heath Ledger as The Joker. Ledger gives such a brilliant performance that when he went off-screen, I couldn't wait to see him on-screen again. He is without a doubt now my favourite cinema villain due to Ledger's Oscar worthy performance. I found myself laughing at his character's humour several times throughout the film. The film is action-packed and I have to say that the action scenes are exciting and exhilarating. They keep you on the edge of your seat and each action sequence seems to be better than the last one. The scene involving Batman on his Batpod (the bike!) and the Joker in the truck is absolutely outstanding. The only problem I have with The Dark Knight is that I felt it's 2 hours 30 minutes length is a tad too long. Don't get me wrong, it was highly entertaining, but I think it should have been slightly shorter and some people (not me) don't appreciate sitting in a cinema for two and a half hours. The Dark Knight is an action-packed masterpiece. I give it 10/10.",positive,10,tt0468569
"The biggest problem of this movie is that it is so overrated. For years and years I have been hearing how amazing this film is. Two times I watched it, two times fell asleep. Was too tired probably. Today I watched it again, once again expecting something great, and again fell asleep. I started watching it two hours after I woke up after a 9 hour sleep! Face it, this movie gets really boring at times. Pitt is often mumbling useless phrases, dull story (after the two get together) and there is an illogical ending. But for me the most disturbing is the whole idea of changing your life, becoming sensitive again(what??) by engaging into bloody, futile fights. Who would do that? You wanna fight, go to Darfur and fight for the starved women and children getting raped and killed every day. Trust me, you'll make your life interesting, you'll escape this ''stinking'' consumer society and on your way might just save someone's life or raise a few eyebrows. I am not from USA and not really aware of this ''horrible'' life of the American white collar worker, but if this movie has ''opened your eyes'' then my friends you really are in it deep. On the good side the movie is very stylish and the acting is first class. 7.5/10 just for these attributes. However since the movie in my eyes never lived up to the hype; ''different, disturbing, entertaining'', its a 6/10.",neutral,5,tt0137523
"As someone who likes the cast, loved the concept and who considers Christopher Nolan very talented and has enjoyed a good deal of his films, 'Interstellar' was somewhat of a let-down. It has a lot of great elements, but also has its flaws and one admires Nolan more for his ambition than his execution. Starting with the praises, 'Interstellar' does look spectacular. It's majestically shot, seamlessly edited and boasts audacious set design and fantastic special effects. The music score from Hans Zimmer is perhaps his best effort for a Nolan film, it has subtlety but also an unnerving eeriness and haunting and heart-wrenching pathos. The sound effects and sound mixing are expertly managed and give a real sense of authenticity. 'Interstellar' however has more than just being technically spectacular. It is thought-provoking and awe-inspiring frequently, with some fascinating ideas, and does have a lot of heart, making the emotional elements genuinely poignant. The Cooper/Murph relationship, which is really what takes centre stage, is beautifully done and often very heartfelt. Nolan directs with great ambition, strong direction of the actors and flawless technical command. Matthew McConaughey proves that his Best Actor Oscar for 'Dallas Buyers Club' wasn't a fluke, he holds everything together in a committed, charismatic and deeply felt turn. MacKenzie Foy matches him beautifully as does Jessica Chastain. Anne Hathaway is sassy and emotive, and there is fine support from John Lithgow and Michael Caine. However, 'Interstellar' is overlong and, because of the wildly variable pacing and that the story doesn't quite have enough content to justify it, it feels it. The pacing is wildly variable as aforementioned, there are times where it's fine but there's some choppiness and stodginess too. Dialogue isn't a strong suit either, there are many times where it's thought-provoking and poignant, but too much of it also consists of confused and at times illogical science (the time and space stuff was convoluted sometimes), forced sentiment and things being over-explained and preachy. Matt Damon's character felt thrown in and not particularly necessary, also somewhat silly, while the ending is far too idealistic and too falsely pat. Overall, less than stellar and was expecting much better. This said, 'Interstellar' is often impressive and very beautiful (especially technically, though the central relationship was also beautifully realised). 6/10 Bethany Cox",neutral,6,tt0816692
"Take Epic Movie, Superhero Movie, Scary Movie and any other spoof film you've ever seen in your life, mix it with an explosive amount of drugs, times that by 10000 and you might have something that slightly resembles Movie 43. In a sentence, this film is an absolute diabolical catastrophe that could end the world as we know it (which the film's somewhat 'story' follows) consisting of a cacophony of well respected actors and humour that made me want to seriously kill myself. That being said, I (regrettably) found myself enjoying the film. The film is shown in the form of a number of short films, all focusing on awful protagonists and scenarios that will make your toes curl. Luckily I have an awful sense of humour and will laugh at almost anything but I found the controversial humour hilarious and I was just amazed at how extreme the directors went into this monstrosity of a media piece. But as much as I enjoyed it, this film is complete and utter cods wallop. A lot of the humour is just distasteful and cheap, the 'story' lacks anything that resembles a real film. If you pay to watch this film, you're in for a huge waste of money. Luckily this film doesn't even attempt to aim for anything realistic or serious which makes it a fun watch as you're waiting to see what the insane directors can conjure up next. I did like seeing the well respected actors show their humorous side though, even if it was in a distasteful manner.

All the plaudits that this film is getting are more than deserved. Heath Ledger & Christian Bale are both brilliant in this film. Ledger was a surprise casting (for me) as the Joker but it is one of the greatest portrayals of a villain I have ever seen in a film!

"When a criminal plot is in place to take down the entire computer and technological structure that supports the economy of the United States (and the world), it's up to a decidedly ""old school"" hero, police detective John McClane, to take down the conspiracy, aided by a young hacker. Well, I can't believe I'm saying this but the newest edition to the Die Hard series may rank with the first. It's superb direction, fantastic acting, groundbreaking special effects and clever quirps will leave you with (almost) nothing to complain about. Die Hard may very well be the best action flick of 2007. It can be beat, but I doubt by a sequel. I am proud to say that Bruce Willis still has some John McClane left in him. Bruce gets to say one of most famous lines in action film history, ""Yippy Ki-ya Motha ******!"", without cuts, he even gets to talk to himself, a scene that is almost identical to the scene in the air vent of the first film. (C'mon, it'll be fun, come out to the coast, have a few laughs.) About all the controversy for the MPAA rating...it was all useless. Die Hard acts just like a rated R film, just because it says PG-13 doesn't mean its not as violent as the others. No, he doesn't say the F word, but it's not as bad as you think. It's more of a character to character type of thing then anything else. John McClane learns to bond with a young hacker. (Justin Long) It's more...I don't know...""cute"" then the other movies, it doesn't need the F word. I don't think there is much else to say. Die Hard is one of my best movie experiences to date. The crowd laughed and screamed and then cheered at the end. The only slightest problem I had with this film was the fact that the realism was quite low.

"Interstellar: Seeing the trailer for this ambitious film, I immediately became overjoyed because if anyone can pull off a movie like this one, it is Christopher Nolan. And who better to lead the charge than Matthew McConaughey. A guy who has completely turned his career around in the past three years and is now consider to be one of the top actors in Hollywood. This movie is incredible to say the least. Interstellar combines interesting concepts and ideas, brilliant script writing and directing to make the most thought provoking and groundbreaking Nolan film yet. This movie was near-perfect too me, but the only thing that kept me from giving it a 9.5/10 was it getting to complicated for it's own good. Towards the end after so much stuff has happened, it gives you more to contemplate just to keep up with whats going on. Still, it does not fall into the same pit as Lucy where towards the end it gets caught in its own complicated story line and it can't get itself out. Also, I feel like they rushed the beginning when they were still on Earth. Nolan seemed as if he wanted to get to space as fast as possible which made the scenes on Earth far less impactful to the audience. I love the acting in films, but in a film like this, the acting is secondary. The primary focus is the special effects. They made entirely new worlds from nothing. Space stations from scratch. Everything imaginable to make this movie believable was created. What I like about Christopher Nolan's films is the fact he tries to use as many ""real environments"" as possible. They were not CGI'd into a spaceship, they were actually in one. What Nolan did to make the acting even greater was he created the imagery before hand. Doing this, the actors reactions to what they saw when they looked out the windows were real. The CGI was still incredible too. The idea and design for the robot they made was breath-taking. They made you believe a futuristic robot could go across any terrain, known or unknown. I firmly believe the CGI could not have been better done and it is, in my opinion, the best in the history of cinema. I would also like to mention I have only ever heard a score for a film this good one other time- Inception. This one might even be better. The music and underscoring conveyed the exact feelings the director wanted the audience to feel at any given moment. The score gave the audience a sense that anything was possible. Anything within our imagination could come true and nothing is ever out of reach. What I love during the film was the special effects, but what I loved so much about Interstellar after watching it was the script writing and directing. The way the Nolan brothers were able to come up with all of the concepts about time relativity and gravity is far beyond me. What I love the most about the script though was how it all came back together at the end. Everything began to make sense. Their were no major plot holes that bothered me throughout or things I could not understand well-enough because the film did not explain it enough. Everything made sense. This film was cast perfectly as well as being written near- perfectly. Matthew McConaughey was a slam-dunk pick to play the lead in the film and he conveyed the perfect normal, but smart loving character needed to make the role work. The scenes where he sees his kids for the first time in years is really amazing because of the overjoyed happy and sad feelings he has to show from seeing his kids grow up without him. Anne Hathaway also did an amazing job and played the part well. The rest of the cast did the best they could with the screen-time they had and I loved the completely unexpected cameo they threw in the film. If you can handle intricate films that you have to pay attention , Interstellar will amaze you.

"The Godfather is a story surrounding an organized crime family named Corleone in the 1940's. The patriarch, Don Vito Corleone, his loyal son Sonny, his daughter Connie who marries the abusive Carlo Rizzi, and his legitimate son Michael who is not involved in the family business. When Michael returns home from the war and Don Corleone is nearly killed by a rival gang, he slowly finds himself being sucked into the life. Though many people will say The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time, it's not. To tell you the truth, it's not an exciting movie at all. It's not action packed, and not a whole lot happens in its 3 hour running time. However, it is a brilliantly made film with some amazing acting, and portrays the most realistic view of the mafia in film history. Let's start off with the acting. Al Pacino who is now recognized as one of the best actors of all time got his start as Michael Corleone in this film. The movie mainly focuses on his getting sucked into the family business. Al Pacino plays the role brilliantly showing both his tempted side and his reluctant side. All of the supporting actors in this film are awesome. There are really solid performances by James Caan as Sonny who has the coolest scene in the film, and Robert Duvall as Tom. Of course, nothing bad can be said about the late Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone. This is Brando's most famous role and for good reason. His genius portrayal will go down in history as one of the greatest acting jobs of all time. The realism of the film is what also makes it good. This is the most realistic view of the mafia you will ever see on film. Most mafia films portray the action side of the story with all the hit men and explosions and gunfights. The Godfather doesn't show a lot of that. It focuses mainly on the business side of things. It shows how serious mobsters really are about their jobs. So, even though The Godfather isn't the greatest film of all time, it's one of the best made. 8.5/10",neutral,5,tt0068646
"Excellent storyteller, music, sound effect, color grading, vfx... 10/10! As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or feelings about movies. However, I can provide you a review based on critical analysis of The Dark Knight: The Dark Knight is widely regarded as one of the best superhero movies ever made. It is a gritty and intense film that explores the darker side of Gotham City and its inhabitants. The movie is anchored by a truly remarkable performance by the late Heath Ledger as the Joker. His portrayal of the iconic villain is chilling, unpredictable, and unforgettable. The movie's other performances are also top-notch, with Christian Bale delivering a powerful performance as Batman, and Aaron Eckhart giving a nuanced portrayal of Harvey Dent/Two-Face. The film's visual effects, action sequences, and score are all exceptional, contributing to the movie's impressive overall quality. One of the reasons why The Dark Knight stands out from other superhero movies is its exploration of complex themes such as morality, justice, and human nature. The movie does not shy away from exploring the darker aspects of society, including corruption within law enforcement and the consequences of vigilantism. It is a thought-provoking film that raises important questions about the role of heroes in modern society. Overall, The Dark Knight is a must-see movie for fans of the superhero genre, as well as anyone looking for a riveting and intellectually stimulating cinematic experience.",positive,10,tt0468569

"I saw the ""famous"" Matrix 3 years ago, after all the hype, I waited for the video. I wasn't like ""Oh, I know this is going to suck."" I had an open mind. I do like this movie for one reason, it made me realize: MY GENERATION RELYS ON COMPUTER EFFECTS?!?!?!!?!?!?!!??! There is practically no plot, crumie acting(except for Morphious), all effects, and just an excuse for computer nerds to get together for this crap. I mean, Spiderman I could deal somewhat, but man. This was nothing. All the actors got in front of a green screne and the director is like ""Ok, pretend that something scary is coming at you!"" Wow, what motivation. I got really bored, tried watching it (going on 5) again, nothing. I can't get it, and I wish Keanu the best of luck. Because I hope the sequal will have more luck. 4/10",negative,4,tt0133093
"A great fantasy epic, with amazing visual effects. Unfortunately the cut is not good at all. The plot is solid but I have to mention that some characters are not deep enough in the Movie in my opinion, compared to the book. However it´s still a very good Movie but I hope the second part of this trilogy is far better in cut. That´s why I give it only 6/10 but it´s a worth see.",neutral,6,tt0120737

"The Wolf of wall street is a riveting film. It's funny, dark, and suprisingly fast paced throughout even though it's 3 hrs long. I feel the length is a bit long for the film, I felt that 5-10 mins could have been cut off the film, and it would've been better. You have great performances from Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort, Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie, along side some fantastic direction from Martin Scorsese. This film really looks in to what money can do to people, how it effects people, and how greedy we can become when we earn alot of money. I like how Jordan Belfort has no remorse and doesn't care what happens, but this is also a problem, due to the character having no remorse, his character doesn't really change at all, by the end, he's still pretty much the same person as he was at the beginning, with some slight changes. It's a great film to watch with a bunch of blokes and I feel it better suits Males than Females. The Cinematography is creative and varied, with some great shots thrown in there. It's a film where characters don't really change or grow, but it does this to great effect to further show what mass amounts of money can do to people. I had a great time watching it and I would definitely recommend it if you were looking for a great time. 8.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0993846

"Heath ledger's acting is literally mind blowing, the writing and story is so awesome, joker backstory theories, Batman was at his coolest in my opinion here. His suit, just perfect balance between both Bruce's egos, however his voice was fine in the dark knight but in rises I finally got outrageous. But there are sad, slow moments, action, fast paced moments, I like the realistic version of Batman, no, I've said literally enough. If you haven't watched this I don't care if you're not a superhero fan, Batman fan, movie fan, if you like entertainment, you WILL LOVE the Dark Knight. This movie would be a 50/10 if I could and Batman Begins is not very far behind at all making that one my second favorite movie of all time.

"Hardcore Henry is a first person action film, and that is about it. This film is very entertaining in terms of an insane, mindless action film. There are both good and bad points about this film, but the major issue people will have with it, would be its edgy, bizarre, shaky-cam. The bad points about this film is its characters, they are bland and boring, with the exception of Sharlto Copley, who is as he is in every film, fantastic. He plays several different characters in the film, with their own unique personalities, which really keeps the film going in some parts. The story is also very poor and not very well thought-out. It is basic, mindless and has little to go on it. But the major issue is the film's effort to look like a video-game. Even some points in the film, I found myself thinking, this reminds me of Call of Duty, or another first-person shooter, such as boss levels. Now the good parts about this film, is the roller-coaster like adventure it takes you on. This is action at its core, and it is directed very well. Because of its first-person story, the fight scenes seem very real in parts, and I found myself scratching my head in wonder how they managed to pull some of the stunts off. There is next to none CGI in this film, and it makes it very realistic. This is a great entertaining movie, but if you are wanting a story, strong characters and the next great action movie, this is not for you. However if you want to sit down in a rainy night, with your friends and want a mindless action film to dazzle yourself with, this film is perfect. Although I would advise not to drink while watching this film, unless you have a mop sitting by. 6/10",neutral,6,tt3072482

They weekly go to the club and have fights with other members while more and more join and more clubs sprout up. It gets violent, psychological, comical, and the whole time its pure entertainment.

"I'm a little late to the party with Se7en, as I first watched it just this year. One of those things where it's been in the queue forever and I'm slowly working my way through. Anyhow as a result of my procrastination, my ""experience"" of the film was slightly desecrated, but my appreciation was not. I realized just before I reached the massive twist of the film that I saw what was coming. I don't even remember who spoiled it for me...but oh well. The only reason I address this is the final scene of the film is by far the most talked-about aspect of the film...by FAR. And I didn't think it was greatest final act shake-up I've seen, but the movie itself is incredible. My favorite part of Se7en is it's stylishness. David Fincher delivers a beautifully noir aesthetic to the piece that colors the entire story. And my other favorite thing about Seven is the surreality of the nameless, ever-raining, Gotham-like, hellhole city where our mystery unfolds. I cannot overstate how much I love that story-telling choice. It gives the film an immeasurable sense of dread and intrigue. Aesthetically, simply a masterpiece. Se7en's other major strength it its leads. The script doesn't over-talk anything; it's economical and concise, but provides just enough chemistry for it's protagonists to make this ""buddy cop"" film stand out. Pitt and Freeman turn in some of their most thoughtful work and play excellently off one another. It's a character piece that succeeds without dwelling too long on exposition or any forced ""bonding"". Their relationship develops naturally, and in the face of abject psychological chaos, calm moments are brief and rare. I suppose it would be unfair to not mention Seven's creatively macabre components as well. I realize I didn't include a synopsis, but if you haven't already heard it 100 times from cinephiles and review sites, I'm sure it's somewhere on this page. The killer in Seven patterns takes inspiration for his murderous work of art from the seven deadly sins, and dispatches his victims in accordance with said sins. But the bizarre and disturbing, (albeit not explicit) murders are still a means to an end. The film's really about the tone, characters, and noir feel. 8.1/10",negative,1,tt0114369

"Here's what I liked about this movie:- I liked Gary Oldman as Sgt Gordon, he acted very well in a part that really didn't give him all that much to do. I liked Morgan Freeman, it was nice to show how Bruce Wayne acquired all his ""toys"" for Batman. I liked Rutger Hauer, but the story behind him working for someone else really didn't come out at all, just a ""stolen microwave"" thing. His character could have had so much more to do. He would have been an excellent pawn in the baddies master plan. I liked Micheal Caine, excellent as Alfred. I liked Christian Bale but I really didn't believe him as Batman, sorry. Not enough trauma and too much showing of him going bad. OK, here's what I didn't like. I didn't like Liam Neeson pretending to be a bad Jedi/Sith again. Liam, you died in the Star Wars series - get over it! Let's train Bruce Wayne in the art of Ninjitsu (supposedly takes a life time but Bruce is only away from Gotham for 7 years?) and teach him to be a force for good but when he questions his teacher about ethics and morality they suddenly want to kill him? Er, WTF? Newly trained ""ninja"" Bruce Wayne defeats a whole room full of people who were teaching him - I Think NOT! If you've seen the trailer then you've seen the best bits of this film. If the police chasing the Batmobile looks familiar then it should do, thats Lower Whacker Drive in Chicago, used in The Blues Brothers over 20 years ago. The creators of this film thought "" Right, lets use tons of stuff out of Batman comic books"" - This is of no use to those of us who don't read Batman comics is it? Most of us are going to know Batman from previous films or the old TV series. Yes, we know The Joker, The Riddler, The Penguin. Scarecrow - who the hell is he then? No explanation behind why he's The Scarecrow, what made him this way - how he got the name. The whole ""have you seen my mask?"" and the voice changer inside along with the hallucogenic drugs still don't explain how or why he became Scarecrow. The attempt (And it was damn feeble) to explain how Bruce becomes Batman and chooses the nickname. ""I'm scared of bats so I think i'll use a bat"". He was attacked by bats. NO HE WASN'T! He fell down a well and spooked some bats who tried to fly away from him, there was no attack, just bats fleeing from a perceived threat. (Oh and real bats wouldn't fly anywhere near a person, they have excellent radar so whoever did the computer generated bats did NO research into how bats fly) Sounds pretty normal but nothing like an attack, eh? Adult Bruce goes down the well with no torch but finds a torch which seems to just appear in his hand like magic. No attack from the bats again? No, of course not. That'd be far too damn sensible. The flashbacks that seem fairly useless, we don't really see why Bruce is arrested. Stealing stuff that belongs to Wayne Industries. Not really theft is it, especially once they've asked him what his name is? The appearance of Liam Neeson in the prison cell. We've put Bruce Wayne into solitary to protect other prisoners who you were fighting with but this hasn't been deemed serious enough to warrant any further prison time, we'll just release you like we were going to. The whole ""people spooked by gas that makes them scared and insane"" just looks like a scene from a Romero film, them shuffling along like Night Of The Living Dead. The girl whose supposed to be insane from gas but sits meekly in a strange fast traveling vehicle. She doesn't recognize Bruce Wayne's voice until near the end of the film, despite the fact they were childhood playmates. No, I don't think so. Plus Bruce already had the cure and he didn't carry it with him when he went to save her? The reason for her being in the house isn't explained? I assume her mother works for the Wayne family. Why do they take Bruce to the opera at all? Why do they leave by the back door? We aren't supposed to question this person killing Bruce's parents when we already know about Jack Napier (aka The Joker) from a previous film. Watch the film and forget about the plot. There isn't really MUCH actual plot to forget about but if you just watch the action and enjoy the fights and the gadgets and The Batmobile then you will love this film. Turn off your brain. The fact that The Batmobile has to jump into The Batcave but it looks like it would be physically impossible for it to jump out. Lets paint the Batsuit black but it's black already - why? Two guys get into an elevator in a fire - the most dangerous thing you can do. Really smart message to the kids, ignore the danger warnings - lifts are safe in a fire if you need to get down from somewhere. The plot of the film gets a 2/10, the action gets a 5/10.",negative,2,tt0372784

"....and could be the best movie ever made. Granted, I've only viewed this epic masterpiece 3 times thus far, I came away feeling ecstatic that such moments of beauty still exist in this world. Last night(Sunday, 8/10), I viewed the movie in IMAX for the 2nd time at a 6:30 showing. The place was sold out. I couldn't believe people sitting in the aisles after the movie had already been released for 3 weeks. We got there 30 minutes before the movie started and 160 out of the 360 tickets were already sold. Let's start with the Joker. Heath Ledger is a god. I've never really loved any of his previous work, but I viewed him as a descent enough actor. Heath Ledger's acting in Dark Knight set a new standard for acting. I can't even put a finger on why he was so good, but he scared me. When they rolled the credits, I had a smile bigger than the Jokers, but at the same time, I was left wondering what if. What if Heath Ledger was still alive, what other great things could have he done? Did Heath become so obsessed with his work, and playing the Joker that it made him insane? Or, was Heath already so mentally unstable that it allowed him to play the Joker with such perfection? I think Heath was starting to come into his own, and realize his potential and everything came together for this movie. We all know the rest of the story. R.I.P. Heath, you made this sad person a happy one for a day. I don't even like Comic Book Movies. With a CBM, you already know none of this could ever happen, so its hard to even have a connection with any movie of this ilk. Unlike other CBM's, the Dark Knight had a very real, almost eerie feel to it. No superpowers, no radiation mutations, no aliens from other planets, just plain people in extraordinary situations. This movie is a classic story of good vs. evil, and why people decide to choose the sides they choose. What makes this movie a 10? Well, besides the fact that it includes the best single acting performance of all time, I couldn't get enough. The plot was rock solid, with many interesting plot twists that kept you guessing. I don't care how much of a veteran you are of movies or comic books, it was impossible to predict what was going to happen next. I love when movies have a perfect balances between plot, character development, and action sequences, and I can't remember a movie that has ever had a better 'flow'. The other thing that I absolutely love in movies is just when you think the movie is over it keeps going and getting better. The acting was top notch. Christian Bale is better than Michael Keaton, he just is. Old people, accept it, and move on. Bale is cooler, more determined, and has a deeper soul than Keaton ever did. Aaron Eckheart was outstanding as Harvey Dent, worthy of a best supporting actor nominee in my opinion. As good as Bale has been as Batman in both movies Eckheart was his equal in this movie as the White Knight. Heck, even Eric Roberts as the mob boss was a convincing character. The symbolism and cinematography was also top notch. The whole idea of people destined to destroy themselves, and how chaos ultimately reigns is fascinating to me. The Joker was the symbol in this movie. The Joker symbolized anarchy and Christopher Nolan's pessimistic nature let his character come alive. It's sad that there are such corrupt people in high levels of power, and while it's just a movie, it begs the question....what if?",positive,8,tt0468569

"Fight Club is an absolute masterpiece and undoubtedly one of the greatest films of all time, deserving an exceptional 11/10 rating. It stands as a monumental achievement in cinematic history, pushing boundaries and challenging conventional storytelling. David Fincher's direction, combined with a stellar cast, delivers an unforgettable experience that leaves an indelible mark on the viewer. From the moment the film starts, it grabs you by the throat and never lets go. The brilliance of Fight Club lies not only in its captivating plot and visceral action sequences but also in its profound exploration of societal discontent and the human psyche. The enigmatic performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are beyond extraordinary, capturing the raw essence of their characters with unparalleled intensity and authenticity. Pitt's Tyler Durden is a charismatic force of nature, while Norton's unnamed narrator is a haunting embodiment of disillusionment and suppressed desires. The chemistry between them is electric, fueling the film's unrelenting energy. The plot itself is a rollercoaster of suspense and unpredictability, leading to a mind-blowing twist that has become legendary in the annals of cinema. This revelation turns the entire narrative on its head, challenging our perceptions and forcing us to question the very nature of identity and reality. Fight Club's bold social commentary on consumerism, masculinity, and rebellion resonates deeply, making it a film that transcends mere entertainment. Fincher's meticulous direction, coupled with its gritty visual style and the iconic narration by Norton, creates an immersive atmosphere that is both dark and visually stunning. The film's impact goes far beyond its release, continuing to influence and inspire filmmakers and audiences alike. Fight Club is a groundbreaking work of art that demands multiple viewings to fully appreciate its brilliance.

"Batman has had a history of movies, both good and bad. I believe most of them were the usual ""kill the villain, protect the innocent civilians and save the day"" sort of films, but this was different. Batman Begins is most likely different from the originals. Why? It has a much darker environment, and takes a much more serious tone. The dark environment is nice. The color black invades the screen, and everything on it- from the costume to the sky. It does have it's moments, but, the entire film lacks action or thrills. You may think that the night sky was only put in there to help you fall asleep easier. It seems to be more of a horror film than an action film. The entire film is good, but far from entertaining. It aims for a darker tone more than anything else, and that sort of tone is best for dramas, such as Falling Down and Mystic River. The hallucination/fear thing was a bit odd too. Hopefully, the sequel will be an improvement, just like X-2 and Spider-man 2. 6.5/10",neutral,5,tt0372784

""The world no longer needs lawyers or engineers,it needs farmers"". With civilization struggling to produce food, technological development and knowledge is put on hold and all focus is shifted to food production. Well, not all focus as we come to know in the first 15 minutes of the film. The government realized the planet wouldn't manage to sustain humanity for much longer and had NASA secretly looking at alternative planets to live in. Our main character, a former brilliant NASA pilot 'forced' to become a farmer to provide for his family, stumbles on NASA's plans and takes it upon himself to become a part of the solution. What follows is an adventure that quickly conquered its place amongst the best movies of all time. The cast is nothing short of terrific, every single character fits and delivers their share flawlessly, even the child actors. I'm surprised Matthew McConaughey didn't get nominated for an Oscar and Hans Zimmer didn't win yet another Oscar since he presented us with yet another memorable soundtrack. The movie is not without flaws, and there's a big one that plays a major role in the final outcome. I wouldn't say it is a plot hole as it is addressed and an explanation is provided, but that explanation falls into a paradox which left a bad taste in my mouth. That's the one thing that keeps me from calling this a masterpiece, because a masterpiece must be flawless and this was not. There were other complaints about the sound being too loud at times or the movie being too long. I disagree on both instances, yes the sound did get loud and I for one am happy it did, we were following the characters through intense catastrophic events with humanity's future on the line and the background music was just as intense, I was pleasantly surprised, I could even tell it had Hans Zimmer hand on it before even checking. As for it being too long, I don't really think one could capture as much detail, develop the plot or make one care about the characters as much with a shorter duration. I treasure most scenes of this movie and would hardly cut any of it. Nolan's approach immerses you in his stories, his films break through clichés and are thought provoking while delivering compelling performances, making him one of the best Directors there is. To make a well conveyed science fiction movie where human nature is at heart was no easy task and while the plot was not flawless, I couldn't think of a better adaptation for it, not could I think of a better Director to accomplish that. One flaw too many 8,5/10 Watch this movie in HD and pump up the sound system if you can, you're in for a ride.",neutral,5,tt0816692
"I really like David Fincher. Each one of his films has a unique visual signature to them and are trademarked with an excellent story. I didn't hate Alien 3 at all. This is his second best film, Fight Club being the first. Everything in it is so well done, from the acting (Kevin Spacey!), directing, script, and visuals. The city this takes place in isn't named but its shown as dark and gritty, constantly raining. The mystery is intense, its something I have never heard of before but it is done so remarkably well. Its hard to find a film like Se7en around, it can only really be matched by Memento. The last twenty minutes of this film are extremly suspensful, possibly the best end twenty minutes of any film. The script is my only problem, because sometimes it gets sloppy and Brad Pitt just unevenly swears. Otherwise, its an excellent thriller that I didn't find shocking at all. 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0114369

You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive"".

"We all know Star Wars and we all know that it is the worldwide famous sf space film made by the legendary director George Lucas in 1977, which revolutionized the possibilities of filmmaking in cinema forever. However, nearly 40 years have now passed since this movie first made a cinematic revolution around the world, and now, better cinematic elements than Star Wars are coming to the big screen and that's just the reason why I don't like Star Wars. It's not even the film of my time in the first place and I was born just around the time when cinema started making further advancements in filmmaking, so it is obvious and logical why I don't like Star Wars. I found the film completely boring and uninteresting, however I do understand the reason why people loved this film BACK THEN. The only things I liked about this movie is the fact that the movie takes place in a galaxy far, far away, which is obviously an original setting for a sf movie, the technically imaginative Death Star, the well chosen cast, Harrison Ford's intriguing character, the Darth Vader costume and mask, the arrival of the light sabers, the plot and the movie's mythology.

"**The Godfather** (1972), directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in cinema history. The story centers around the powerful Corleone crime family, led by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), as they navigate loyalty, power, and betrayal in the dangerous world of organized crime. As Vito's youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), is reluctantly drawn into the family business, the film examines his transformation from a war hero into a ruthless mafia boss. The film is a perfect blend of compelling storytelling, complex characters, and iconic performances. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is legendary, bringing a quiet yet commanding presence to the role. Al Pacino's nuanced performance as Michael is equally powerful, as his character's journey from innocence to corruption drives much of the film's emotional weight. The supporting cast, including James Caan as Sonny and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, adds further depth. Coppola's direction is masterful, creating an immersive atmosphere with its deliberate pacing, stunning cinematography, and haunting score by Nino Rota. The film's themes of family, power, and morality resonate on a deeply human level, elevating it beyond a typical crime drama. **Rating: 10/10** - *The Godfather* is an unparalleled masterpiece that transcends the crime genre, offering a richly layered exploration of power, loyalty, and the dark side of the American Dream. Its impact on cinema is profound, making it a timeless classic.",positive,10,tt0068646

"After watching Leprechaun 2, I thought the series from this film and on, with it's oddly absurd scenes and horrible dialogue would soon fall flat on it's face. By watching the trailer, I had a good feeling that this film would be good, but I still wasn't sure. Boy, this one was way up in the series. It beats Lep 2. Even at one stage I thought it was nearly better than 1! I don't, but I definitely think this is the top Leprechaun sequel of the series. I believe after this Lep film, they suddenly went down hill, because they couldn't think of anymore ideas. Here's why I think Lep 3 is such an awesome sequel. The film's music isn't really heard to the best in my opinion, but it works enough to show the film's true colors. I believe they went back to the more campy/black humor slasher style of the original Leprechaun. They had a great plot like the previous and there were some great characters with absolutely awesome-stupid violence. Even the deaths this time round I felt were funnier. I mostly have to give props to Warwick Davis as the Leprechaun again, as he did a marvelous job with making him more interactive with the human side of life, which includes meeting an Elvis lookalike or sawing fazio on his magic show with a Chainsaw! All of these elements which I positively praise, I think make this sequel a tad stronger than it's predecessor. Sure like every Leprechaun film so far, many of the plot lines and the story itself don't make sense, but it doesn't matter. These films are an excellent time waster, because of how funny they are. I highly recommend Leprechaun 3 as it is definitely one of the best in the series by far. It'll be 7.5/10 schillings out of 10 me las",neutral,5,tt0113636
"This movie is infamous for being awarded the title of Worst Movie Ever Made. While admittedly it is bad, Plan 9 is simply not deserving of this title. Okay, still with me? Good. Plan 9 is a terrible, incoherent, inept film. However, it is saved from the trash heap by one simple fact: the movie is consistently FUNNY. From Criswell's moronic prediction at the start of the film (""future events such as these will affect us in the future"") to the flaming pie tin saucer at the end, the film is a laugh riot. It's junk, but it's entertaining junk, and in that respect it is still a good movie. If you don't believe me, watch Plan 9 and a truly awful movie (say, ""Manos: Hands of Fate"" or ""Battlefield: Earth"") back to back. You'll see the difference immediately. Nevertheless, Ed Wood can't get off scott free on this one. Plan 9 is funny, but it was *intended* to be a serious film about alien invasion (sort of). What he's done is pull a Homer (from the Simpsons; a phrase meaning ""to succeed despite idiocy""). The fact that this is Bela Lugosi's last film - and that he died before it was made, and they just took some footage of him and built a movie around it - makes me cringe. Laughable or no, this movie deserves a place on the Bottom 100. It just doesn't deserve the coveted #1 slot. I reserve that dishonor for truly awful films like Manos, where absolutely EVERYTHING was terrible, or for movies where despite having every resource in Hollywood at their disposal, the end result is still unwatchable, like Battlefield: Earth. 2/10 stars - Painful, but a good kind of pain.",negative,2,tt0052077

Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer should be arrested, re-arrested and solitarily confined in a minute hole situated in a remote village near Papa New Guinea. They must be stopped.

"This movie is one of the WORST movies ever. There's alot that is wrong but the things that makes me the most mad are the following. Long pauses:
I get if things move fast, you might forget whats happening. But here, the pauses makes you forget since nothing happens for literally 20 seconds. Plot:
The plot is nothing new, it's a common plot that has been done before. But, since the movie is from the 60s, I guess the topic was new/trendy? Music:
The probaby worst thing about this movie. At first I liked it, but it soon gets boring since its repeated during the whole movie. The most ""original"" song is in the beginning, where somebody sang some ""opera"" but when one of the characters say something you barely hear anything from them, due to the ""opera""
Other than that, expect some maniac playing the piano and somebody blowing their lungs out on a saxophone. The only ""good"" thing is the camera angles. Most of them are bad, but some are really good. Many scenes are done in one take though. 1/10

Brando rightfully deserved the Oscar he received for the movie (although his performance in On the Waterfront was better).

Coppola got everything right and made the right choice of choosing the no-name actor Pacino (at the time) for the role as Michael. There was also James Caan and Robert Duvall that played their roles superb as well. I have probably seen this movie over 60 times and every time, I realize I'm watching a masterpiece in film.

"Incredible opening, really pulls you in. Jack Nicholson plays a pretty despicable mob character. I love how they did the lighting when they first introduce Jack's character. He's shadowed in darkness like he's a mysterious figure, while everyone else is bathed in light where you can see their face. Scorsese is a master at storytelling, character backstory/development, editing, lighting, cinematography. He's very clever and smart at putting a movie together. He pays an insane amount of attention to detail and thinks of every little thing. Flip phones were all the craze back when this movie came out and Scorsese reminds us of that. Even makes it cool. In this movie, the phone is a more dangerous and useful weapon than the gun. Even the sound design for the phones when they open and close them makes it sound like their weapons. The dialogue is gritty, punchy and pretty funny at times. Characters have a lot of depth, substance and backstory. They're complex and morally ambiguous. The tone of the movie is gritty, dark and hard-hitting. There's shades of dark humor throughout that lighten the mood. It's a very engaging movie. The soundtrack is awesome. Scorsese films this movie in a cool type of style similar to Tarantino. The editing is fast-paced, feels like those Hong Kong crime movies. The movie goes by very quickly, it's very well written. It has a sort of cat and rat aspect about it where the anticipation builds and builds waiting to see who will get caught first. This is what makes the movie so engaging and gripping. This movie highlights the corruption that can exist within the police force. How there's insider cops and detectives that work for underground organizations and mafias. The movie has an undertone of paranoia where it's hard to trust characters. It's one of those movies where it's hard to really like any of the characters since they're all kind of morally corrupt and ambiguous. It's such a dirty, dark and corrupt world in this movie. The movie definitely has rewatchability and I'll be revisiting it again in the future, but not anytime soon. Raw score: 8.3/10.",negative,3,tt0407887
The Matrix starring the one and only Keanu Reeves with a sci-fi that will leave you on your feet on how to save the human plant and stop secret agents from killing off the world in the 90s the matrix is a movie that might be in your interest. In all the movie was a good film lots of positives was interesting and kept me engaged but it might not be for everybody as it shows a lot of negatives. The movie has a plot of a young man named Neo who is working an everyday job at a tech company and dealing off computer hacking cards we notice he just lives like any man trying to earn a little extra cash he then gets called to the Matrix as he is sent to a different place then his normal 90s life as he is in the Matrix. Now this movie is quite confusing at times I get lost in the plot you are going from the Matrix back to 90s time after time I get lost at times where the setting was and if they were in the Matrix. Now the acting is not the best I would say either now they do have some good actors who keep you entertained and intrigued in the movie. But in a couple of fight scenes we left in aw in how lame the kicks or punches were and how bad they did with some punches in kicks. But we get stunned by how bad Keanu Reeves facial expressions are during the whole film. He only has one face like looking at a man taking a poo in the toilet. In all the acting was decent besides some bad moments of seeing a Keanu Reeves poo face. It did do a good job and really carried the film to make me continue and watch it. The plot does confuse me a lot at times which does throw me off but you should give it a try and see how you think of it. Next thing was the outfits throughout the whole film as they show the people in the Matrix when they get sent back to the 90s they wear such plan easy to see clothes as they try and look discreet but really at the time of the film would be easy to be noticed they wear all black everything except for the one woman who we barely get to hear from throughout the whole film we just assume she is something special then? But overall was just said to see nothing cool and futuristic as it is a SCI-FI film! Now the soundtrack was quite good was great for fighting scenes keep us to watch the film even if the acting was not there but it was nice to hear. If you like simple outfits and a good soundtrack then I would recommend this movie to you. Overall was a movie I would rank a 6/10 which is decent for a sci-fi for me but it was still not as good as some of the older films that I had seen before this. Just know this film will draw you off to maybe check your phone for a call or a text as it might draw you away but trust me the acting will save it and the soundtrack otherwise it's lost like Forrest Gump tryna to find Jennie.,neutral,6,tt0133093
"Coppola's crime saga is sweeping in scale yet intimate in scope, focusing as much on family dynamics as mafia machinations, and is all the more impactful for it. 'The Godfather (1972)' honestly feels epic, despite the fact that its relatively few key events are all quite contained (considering it spans nearly three-hours.) This effect is hard to put your finger on but certainly tangible, especially in retrospect; it really feels as though you've witnessed a journey, the beginning of an empire or at least a transitioning period within it, in a way which few films have achieved. It's actually a fair while before we learn anything out-rightly illegitimate is actually transpiring, though, and even then its all treated so casually that it really does feel just like the family business. That's a real strength of the picture, too: how little it relies on needless exposition to convey its characters or world. It is refreshing to get a truly inside perspective on sometimes unseemly events without ever being bombarded with morality, but instead trusted to make up our own minds about several situations that are shaded in grey. While the piece is a little long and can sometimes meander, several explosive sequences and character-driven moments add up, in equal measure, to an excellent experience overall that has defined the gangster genre. It is regarded a classic for good reason. 9/10",positive,9,tt0068646

Visually the film is stupendous but no one looks at a postcard for three hours,there is no real tension or character development,no real introduction of the members of the Fellowship who join later,here by the way the decision makers have blundered by casting Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean as virtual twins playing the same role when in the book Tolkien has contrasting Characters in these roles. Perhaps this Ensemble will grow in later episodes and my comments will seem unfair,maybe one day after the third episode is finished a film buff will sit down an endure the whole nine hours or whatever in one sitting and will proclaim that it is ""The Greatest"" again but as of now after episode 0ne just like the cartoon i'm left hoping but still unsatisfied. 6/10 so far.",neutral,6,tt0120737

"Well, here it is, what the MCU has been building towards, a showdown of epic proportions and a gathering of (most) of the numerous superheroes we've been subjected to mercilessly over recent years.
So the big question is, was it worth the wait? To put it bluntly, no, it wasn't. No doubt Marvel fanboys (and girls) will go crazy for 'Infinity War' and regardless of the quality of the film itself, it is going to be loved and lauded by the franchise's enthusiasts simply for the privilege to see all of their beloved characters together in one place.
Unfortunately the enthusiasm of the fans does not seem to have reached the actors themselves, who now appear to have reached the point where they've realised that the film is going to be a commercial, and to a degree, critical success, no matter how well (or poorly) they perform. So, consequently, they don't really bother to put in much effort. And why should they? Their sizeable paychecks are already guaranteed just by showing up. So, just showing up is what they choose to do.
After all, let's face it, unlike the devoted audiences that continue to spend their hard-earned cash to go and see these films, they're in it for the money, not for their love of the source material. The lead actors universally deliver not only the worst performances of their MCU careers, but in some cases (Mr. Downey Jr., I'm looking at you), arguably the worst performances of their entire cinematic careers. Content to just coast through proceedings without a shred of genuine emotion or charisma, they seem to be merely fulfilling the terms of their contracts, as opposed to what you'd call 'acting'. 
And these are not bad actors, by any stretch of the imagination, almost each and every member of the ensemble cast have proven they are capable of delivering outstanding performances (Chris Pratt and Tom Holland not included) in their other filmic endeavours. So it has to be said that their devoted followers deserve better. 
 
The one shining light in all of this is, ironically, the film's chief villain (or hero, depending on your viewpoint, but I'm not going to get into that now), 'Thanos', portrayed brilliantly by Josh Brolin, who seems to be the only actor that's aware he is in fact in a very, very big film and not some frivolous dress rehearsal. Maybe, as a newcomer to the franchise, in his excitement to be a part of the biggest cinematic universe of all time, he was determined to deliver an outstanding performance worthy of the Marvel name, or maybe he's simply the only one who cares enough to try. Either way, it's extremely hard to find anything to criticise him about personally. Well done, Mr. Brolin. Now, the reason I've been so critical in my lambasting of the acting in this film, is because of how important is is to the outcome of the end product. This is supposed to be a genuinely emotional, moving cinematic experience, which if you can suspend disbelief enough, is not out of the realms of possibility. But when the characters appear to be completely indifferent to the events unfolding around them, it's very hard to empathise with them, much less care about what happens to them.
Without giving to much away, as many of you will know, it's in this film that we have to say goodbye (at least temporarily) to some of the saga's most beloved characters, I won't spoil anything by stating who these may be, but I will say that it's very unlikely that you're going shed a tear over, or indeed, give a damn about any one of them. As for the plot, well obviously it's no 'Citizen Kane', but it's far from boring either, however the generic action sequences, though typically spectacular in their visual effects, can begin to border on tedious at times. I know i'm not alone when I saw enough is enough. This exercise in escapism has been enjoyable enough at times, but it has now run it's course. I'd love to believe that after the next instalment of the Avengers, this whole MCU fiasco can finally draw to a close, however, I've got a sneaky suspicion that the powers that be will still manage to drag this out for at least the next few years, if not the next decade. 
But, as a passionate film fan, i'm now going to try to avoid these movies as best as i can and stick to more intelligent, adult-orientated and, for lack of a better word: 'real' cinema.

Kingpins latest dastardly scheme is tearing the fabrics of reality apart and alternate universe versions of Spiderman have all ended up in the same universe. I'm sure you can work out what happens next. So the animation style is a tweak on Pixar, it plays out like a comic book and call me weird but that certainly didn't work for me. The animation doesn't flow fluidly, it looks hokey, disjointed and I found myself frustrated by it. The plot is a novel concept and I liked it, the delivery however I did not. Certain aspects make very little sense, sure it's a Spiderman film so I'm not supposed to think about it too much but I did and my conclusions were migraine inducing stupidity. Did I say stupidity? Oh the stupid doesn't end there sadly, I get the multiverse concept of anything is possible but their Spiderman variant choices were bafflingly dumb and what you'd expect from a Saturday morning cartoon not a blockbuster film! It tries to be heartfelt, but comes across half-assed.
It tries to be funny, but comes across childish.
It tries to be action packed but the style of animation didn't allow it to be done justice. Okay I'm slating the film right now so it probably sounds like I hated it, which I didn't. 6/10 is a fair rating and suggests its above average and it is. But I'm annoyed at the acclaim that's it's been bathed in. 8.6 rating on IMDB are you kidding me? And the Oscars have lacked credibility in my eyes for years because of their ridiculous bias and genre-snubbing but this right here is the last bit of credibility up in smoke. I'm not saying a superhero movie shouldn't be Oscar worthy, but this silly cartoon simply isn't (And neither is Black Panther but I'll resist the urge to rant). Into the Spider-Verse to me is no different than all the straight to DVD Marvel and DC efforts we see a couple of each year. The only difference here is the animation style, nothing else sets it apart. I just don't get the appeal. The Good: Some great writing Great idea The Bad: Animation hardly flows Unexpectedly silly Plot holes that are unforgivably stupid",neutral,6,tt4633694
"""The Dark Knight"" isn't just a movie; it's a cinematic success that transcends the superhero genre, leaving a lasting mark on the world of film. Nolan masterfully weaves a complex and morally ambiguous take of chaos and order, exploring the thin line between heroism and villainy. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is legendary! He is a force of nature and added layers of depth to the character. Heath Ledger steals every scene with a magnetic presence that is both terrifying and mesmerizing. Christopher Nolan's vision, coupled with Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance makes it an instant modern classic.",positive,10,tt0468569

"Oh my God, where do I start? Come on, let's go with the good stuff. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix portray their characters perfectly. I have no quibble here - they're both more than good! Fact. The direction and cinematography are top notch, for which kudos to Ridley Scott and John Mathieson. As for the story - boring and predictable. Pretending to be something great. Misrepresents the facts and generally everything about it is TOO ""Hollywoodized"". You see what I mean. There's no way I'm going to like a production like that. The American style feels too much and personally doesn't fit a story like this for me. Overall, I'm extremely disappointed with ""Gladiator"" (2000) and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone, although I know most people will enjoy it. It's not my cup of tea, and I even object to some of the things it tries to idealize in an artificial way. Final score: 3/10.",negative,3,tt0172495
"I usually enjoy spoof movies just to get kicks, but this is the worst spoof movie ever. I only chuckled once and nearly puked the other times because it was so bad. There is no need to describe the plot. The plot is basically the same as 300 with American culture things thrown it. I think that the creators of this movie went overboard with the gay jokes. The creators have to know that gay jokes are funny at a minimum, not like in this movie. The only reason I gave this movie a 3 because the joke regarding Britney Spears is a bit funny and Carmen Electra is pretty. Other than this, I found out the hard way that I should not watch this tripe. My warning to others: Do not waste your money renting or buying the DVD unless you want an hour and twenty minutes of torture. I rate this movie 3/10.",negative,3,tt1073498
"I am not personally a fan of the standard Marvel Film formula, I think the majority of Marvel films end up falling into the 4/10-6/10 range. However, whenever a film branches out from the standard MCU template, such as the X-Men films or Into the Spiderverse, it can be really good. This movie was special in that is was a part of the mainline MCU series, and still managed to do something completely different from what audiences are used to. And not only was this branching out, it also tied together over twenty movies and provided an excellent climax to the overarching plotline of Thanos and the Infinity Stones. While I have mixed feelings about Endgame, which serves as the conclusion to the MCU Infinity Stones Saga, this film is the climax, and is executed in a nearly flawless way. The film actually manages to massively improve upon the plotline from the comics, as in the comics Thanos was trying to kill half the universe to impress Death, because Death is female in Marvel comics and Thanos wants to be romantically involved with her. This is actually the plot of the comics, and is honestly pretty stupid, so I really like that his motivation was changed for the film. Only real issue with the movie is that it still has some of the cheesy Marvel ""awkward"" comedy, but it's a lot more toned down in this film compared to all of the other movies. There is also the fact that some plotlines with certain characters are set up and then not addressed in Endgame, but that's more of an issue with Endgame rather than Infinity War, so it should not be considered a detriment to this movie. 9/10 If you like Superhero films this is a must see.",negative,4,tt4154756
"I went to a friends house last night and rented movies. I picked Se7en to rent because I've always wanted to see it since I saw David Fincher's masterpiece, Fight Club and his well made thriller, Panic Room. People have always said this movie was good so I wanted to see it if they were right and they were sure right. Seven is an insanely brilliant film from start to finish. The performances by Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, and especially Brad Pitt are all phenomenal in this chiller. The movie was just plain out suspenseful and left my heart beating fast til the movie was done. The twist at the end was very intense and you never knew it was coming. Totally unpredictable. Overall, a fantastic film and David Fincher is a pure genius when it comes to smart films and Se7en deserves to be one of the greatest thrillers that has ever been made. I highly recommend it.

"I only have 9 minutes to review this film so I will do my best. To begin, it is troubling to see a film like this, with decent production value, end up being such a huge disappointment. The cinematography for this film wasn't groundbreaking but it can at least be considered 'solid'. As for the premise itself and the painfully unrealistic script, the same cannot be said. The Bye Bye Man is so devoid of anything that can be considered even remotely realistic. The plot is simple - which isn't necessarily a bad thing - but the plot points that fill out the storyline are just...dumb. The circumstances that motivate the characters to act are questionable in and of themselves and the responses that the characters have to their issues are boring and, once again, unrealistic. I can forgive a movie with wooden acting, stilted dialogue, and embarrassingly stereotypical characters if it is, at the very least, fun. Sadly, The Bye Bye Man is the farthest thing from fun. I will admit that I laughed at some of the serious parts of the movie, but not in an enjoyable way. Half of the time I found my eyes rolling into the back of my head because of corny dialogue or weird, unmotivated character actions. All in all, this film was just...not fun, not smart, not entertaining, and hardly original. If 2017 was the year when horror movies took a nosedive in artistic value, this was the film that helped to sink the ship. 3/10 extremely generous stars...",negative,3,tt4030600
"This film should barely scratch out a spot in the top 250, let alone be one of the top ranked films of all time. It is rather dull, extraordinarily predictable, and filled with clichés.

I'd give it a 7-8/10 (Freeman & Co. do not disappoint), but someone needs to bring down this bloated rating. The film is little more than a rehashing of conventional sentimentalism painted in prison stripes and sold in bulk to a (apparently) gullible audience.

"First let me say that this movie does not deserve only one star. My real rating would be a six to an eight (depending on your taste in movies) but I had to compensate. Compensate for what? Well, literary device, I'm glad you asked. Toolsthe answer is tools. No, not instruments used to construct objects or to do maintenance work around the house such as a hammer or screw driver. I'm talking about people, people who are easily swayed by other people's opinions and by mass marketing campaigns. Unfortunately, almost everyone in America (including myself) is subject to tooldom from time to time so we can really only judge others based on the extent and frequency to which a person is a tool. Now I realize that these tools sound pretty scary so here is a trick you can use to spot and avoid the biggest of these flaming idiots. If they have ever given The Dark Knight 10/10 stars or referred to it as ""one of/the greatest movies of all time"" well then Lil Miss Daisy I'm afraid you have a huge tool on your hands. I recommend immediate euthanasia. Why this movie is not up to par is covered thoroughly in other negative reviews, I simply felt the need to explain why there are so many overwhelmingly positive reviews. It's quite simple really. The media told everyone they should likeso they did. These people then went out and told their friends that they should like itso they did. And these friends then went out and told other friends that they should like itso they did. So it went until one day TDK topped the list of IMDb's greatest movies of all time. What it boils down to is that this is your basic super hero movie that got really good media coverage. Had the initial media coverage been negative and Heath Ledger (God rest his soul) not died at an unfortunately opportunistic time for Hollywood this never would of happened. Basically what I'm saying is someone told you this movie was good, so you went into it with a positive attitude and were willing to ignore some of the flaws. And while the revelation that going into something with a positive attitude will make the experience better for you might not surprise you or anyone else on the planet I feel that the warm fuzzy feeling towards this movie has gotten to a point of excess. Too many people told you it was good. You went into it with too positive an attitude and you ignored too many of the flaws. This movies current average (9/10) is absurd and a perfect example of why all my scathing comments about tools in the previous paragraph are justified. It's an OK movie and a good movie if you like action movies and are willing to ignore glaring plot holes like the villain spitting in the face of physics and being able to do or be anything anywhere at any time he wanted.",positive,10,tt0468569
"Having just watched the film last night, I still am not quite sure how I felt about the whole thing. I, for one, was disappointed, because, the monsters were not demons from Hell, nor were they aliens from space. In short, this was basically a Resident Evil movie with a higher budget and bigger monsters. I suppose now I shall summarize the story. A group of Marines receives a stress call from a research station on Mars known as Olduvai, or, something of that nature. Led by Sarge(Played beautifully over-the-top by The Rock), and the group of Marines heads to Mars through some type of travel device known as the Arc that was found 20 years ago on Mars. Their mission: To find the 6 missing scientists, find any government property, and search and destroy any threat they come across. Soon, all hell breaks loose. One of the biggest problems with the movie was what they decided to be the cause of the monsters. They were not demons from hell or from outer space, but they were the result of uncontrolled genetic mutation in humans. Sound like Resident Evil to you? I thought so. THe cast does a great job for the most part, especially the lead, Reaper(Played by a gruff Karl Urban). The film is very poorly lit, and is extremely graphic and bloody. I don't know, I was guess I was expecting more suspense and a survival horror element, but that was not here. It was a pure action movie. I must say, the creature and digital effects were done very well, though. Overall, as long as you don't go into it with high expectations, or a knowledge of the games, you won't be disappointed. The action is, for the most part, non-stop and very gory. The acting is pretty solid, and the film moves at a very quick pace. A pretty decent way to kill two hours, and a good popcorn movie. However, I still felt very disappointed. DOOM runs 1hr. 53min, and is rated R for Strong Violence/Gore and Language. 6.5/10",neutral,5,tt0419706
"It seems as if this film was intended to be an intelligent film about our culture, but what it turns out to be is a mismash of guys beating each other. This film is far from entertainment, its more of punishment. Not because of the violence, but because of how absolutely STUPID it is. I caught on to what little philosophy and plot it had, and I found nothing of interest. They are trying to change society by making the people understand what their idea of society is, but what they (Pitt and Norton) dont realize is that maybe some people dont want to be changed, maybe the people actually like their life, even though their little Fight Club doesnt like it. Why must people always try to change others. People live their life the want to, maybe their not movie stars, but who really wants to be a movie star, it doesnt sound like fun to be on magazines and people taking pictures of you in your own private household. I think Fight Club missed this. It missed that not everyones the same, people are different. This is what keeps society going. This film is so full of ego's that its just sickening. As if anyone really wants to watch two men beat each other to death. This is not fun to watch. Violence can be handled in the right way in such films as Taxi Driver, A Clockwork Orange, or Schindlers List. But Fight Club as none of the qualities of these masterpieces. Its all about two big stars beating each other and less about society. 2/10",negative,2,tt0137523
"You know, it's hard sometimes when you see this extremely thought- provoking movie that thought-provokes you SO much, that you have no idea how to start your review. Other movies have hit me in some emotional way, but Fight Club did it in a secretive way. A way that I don't know what exactly hit me, but I know something hit me.. So instead of blabbering on about how much it 'hit' me, how about getting into actual stuff? The acting was surprising from both leads. Brad Pitt surprises me left & right, but this was the first time where I saw Edward Norton, and thought: ""wow, he CAN act!"" And he rightfully can. The plot, at first glance, may seem like your typical boxing movie that adds in one new thing and stamps itself ""the best movie ever."" Well that's not the case. In the first ten minutes, I thought I was watching an entire different movie. Edward Norton narrates every little thing he does, sees, or thinks. It was a really strange set-up, but the strangeness was intriguing.. Then there's the people who bash this film because they find out the twist, finding it silly. I'm sure none of these people ever heard of multiple personality disorder? I thought it was a surprising twist. And for a film like this? A fantastic twist...But plot, characters, acting, directing, sound design, cinematography, and screenplay do even qualify to compete with this film's brilliance. Strangely enough, you don't even know what was so brilliant about it. You just know that something was there that made you go ""wow"" and think and think. That's film-making.. But the whole atmosphere of the movie, the whole directorial style Fincher creates, is mystifying. He has created this genre that I can't even get a grasp on. And it contains philosophical elements as well, which further enhance the underlying brilliance of it all... And Fight Club also works as a comedy. A dark, dark comedy. Some parts are so devilish evil that you can't help but smile. Need more? Fight Club works as a counterpart. Let me rephrase. It works as a study. It works as a masterpiece. Everything and anything the movie contains was surely not what you'd expect. ""Fight Club."" You hear those words and think another attempt at creating yet another boxing movie. No depth, no substance. But when you see it, you'll understand. You'll understand a lot more of everything... Fight Club is much more an audience film than it is a critic's film. Critics rate the film itself, not even attempting to appreciate it's social commentary or it's brilliant message to the world. But I did. You will too. Fight Club competes with cinematic classics. It works as everything it's not. It's a favorite of mine. A brilliant, clever film. A film that will engage you with it's warm embrace. To have you reconciling every bit and piece. So what are you doing reading this review on the internet? Get off your lazy ass, and get out there. Do something with your life. While your sitting here doing nothing but reading this film, people are appreciating this film, while you are just reading the synopsis, trying to understand something you can't.

"Movie 43 is a sketch comedy movie tied together with one story connecting them all together. The rest of the movie is a bunch of sketches focusing on testicles, feces, boobs and other stuff that can be funny if done well, but unfortunately it isn't done well here. This movie isn't funny, yeah, I guess you can call that the biggest crime for this supposed comedy. I laughed twice, once at a line by Emma Stone and once during the final skit, everything else either made me gag, or got no reaction from me at all. Speaking of which, the movie is just disgusting, in two ways. One it's jokes rely on bodily functions and human body parts, and half the time I was just looking away groaning. It's also disgusting in how it portrays certain people. Asians, African Americans, People with disabilities, women, hell, even white men will be offended. The acting isn't that great, which surprises me since the cast is filled with a lot of talent. It's mean and overly violent just for the sake of it and makes the film feel less like a comedy. And it doesn't even look that good. I know that the film is supposed to be made of skits that were made by normal people, but everything looks so cheap. Now, like I said I did laugh a couple of times, and some skits do manage to get a smile at points, but they are quickly diminished. And I will give the movie credit that I had no idea where it was going. And I can't really say I was bored, although near the end I was wondering how much time was left. Movie 43 is so bad I didn't even watch the credits with the bloopers and all that. It's offensive, not funny, incredibly mean spirited, and isn't even good on a filmmaking stand point.

"Now this is why we go to movies. I'm surprised at how this film flopped when it was first released in 1994 and yet 11 years later, it's considered one of the greatest movies of all time. I think it's the greatest movie of all time (sorry, to all of those who think that title goes to ""The Godfather""). Yet, here is a movie that in all instances should have failed. Maybe it was because of the plot, which shared too many likenesses to every cliché prison drama we've ever seen. But I assure you, that's not what goes on here. Directed by Frank Darabont, who wrote the film's script, which is an adaptation of the Stephen King short story ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,"" ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is filled with a strong sense of self-worth and purpose. Yes, in the beginning a man named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted for a murder he did not commit. Behind the walls of Shawshank penitentiary, Andy finds himself the victim (a ""fish"" - prison slang for a new arrival) of violent acts by other hardcore convicts. He begins a tentative friendship with a fellow lifer, Red (Morgan Freeman, in an Oscar-nominated role), and Andy finds himself doing the taxes of the warden (Bob Gunton). In all of this, we know that a man, like Andy, is not meant to be locked up, whether he committed a heinous crime or not because simply, the human spirit is not meant to kept down by mortal circumstances. This lends a great amount of weight and structure to the film's most powerful image, which has ingrained itself indelibly into our minds. This movie carefully avoids clichés, and it's the better for it. Tim Robbins is a revelation in this movie, as is Morgan Freeman and the rest of the supporting players. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a film about hope in even the most bleak of places, which could be considered prison. It's a movie that has rightfully earned a place in cinematic history as a legend and a masterpiece of film. It's no wonder why. 10/10",positive,10,tt0111161
"This movie has style, a good look, and above average performances by all involved. This would include not just the people in the camera frame, but most behind the camera as well. I say most, because the most important person behind the camera - the writer - failed miserably in the creation of a compelling story. This story is like someone we all know. Someone we do not understand. Do we not understand them because they are too smart? No - it is not all knowing intelligence. So then, perhaps they are too philosophically deep? Nope... you can recognize the truth of a person who is too deep. They are always falling back on generalized *forest through the trees* metaphors. This person we all know but do not understand thinks sideways. There is enough connection in what they say to seem logical, but there is no logic there at all - just a loose connection of facts or ideas to make disjointed conversation seem deep or intelligent: enter The Signal. This movie makes no sense, try as you might to convince yourself it does. Where one element follows logic, another parallel element completely falls apart. Where one question is attempted to be answered, another is left needlessly dangling. Then perhaps this movie is some metaphor for life experience, or a radical, amazing happenstance? Nope, its crap - because good scripts, and good movies will let you know when they are breaking tradition. This movie just flows sideways, first subtly, then absurdly, leaving the viewer cheated of the time invested. If style is enough you may like this movie. If your a die hard fan of science fiction, you may find enough here to validate the experience. However, if your looking for an actual good movie, with skillful representation of excellent writing: don't stop and watch the traffic (signal). There is as much meaning here as rush hour, and to the experienced media viewer, exactly as much frustration. Lucky to get 3/10",negative,3,tt2910814
"Martin Scorcese's ""The Departed"" won the Oscar for Best Picture last night (2/25/07). Simply by that large achievement my review will be posted here, just to get off my chest a few personal opinions of this film. This film by large was applauded by virtually every critic that has a area to express a view for movies. While that alone will not be enough to get me excited about a movie (especially nowadays), I am a big fan of Scorcese's work, particularly ""Raging Bull"", which I believe to be the best film to have come out in the last 25 years. So to say that I was looking forward to ""The Departed"", with it's dream male cast of Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Matt Damon (criminally overlooked for a Best Supporting Actor Nomination), Alec Baldwin, and Leonardo DiCaprio, would be a bit of an understatement. To save some unnecessary details about the film (which, incidentally, if you look at any other reviews, you would have seen already), I will simply say that this film suffered from (largly): Scatterbrained, attention-deficit disorder editing/screen writing, where the average scene seemed to be all of 14 seconds long, especially in the first 45 minutes... Deriviative, plagiarized writing that Scorcese has done (much better) before. Gangster picture with violent, non-sensical action meaning nothing, and rapid-fire scenes with music loud and in your face (gee, haven't I heard that Rolling Stones song before?) Undeveloped, unlikeable lead character in DiCaprio. There is no substance to his character and doesn't receive on bit of concern from the audience-goer. Also, while he is a very capable actor, he is just still far too young looking to head a clearly very adult-natured film. The only thing that saves this movie is the mildly-surprising ending and Matt Damon's unheralded work. He is truly a gifted actor and deserves more acclaim for his work. 4/10 rating.",negative,4,tt0407887

If you are squeamish, you may not want to see it. There are some very painful bloody scenes, but if you can stomach it, then check it out. There is also a huge twist in this film that almost rivals the twist at the end of The Sixth Sense. And I must admit, it is the twist in this film that made me really love it.

"No offense but it is so obvious that TD is far worse than IA: from the plot, the directing to camera and story-telling. The original lasts for less than 2h and it blows audiences' mind with intense and unexpected twists. This one has more than 2h and a half and the best it can do is re-telling the original'story without any improvements but even worse. I fell asleep after half of the film. The characters are very poor- developed. Leo's and Matt's character get the top-rank position in about 4 months?! I mean come on, are you kidding me? We're not kids to be fooled like that. In IA, Yan and Ming in IA took almost 10 years to earn their credibility in the workplace. Yan had to work undercover for many bosses and live the life of a true criminal: assaulting, drugging and killing. Not just hanging around and beating up some guys like Leo did. And since when a just graduated-fish like Matt's guy can become an inspector in matter of months. My goodness! Also, why was that stupid screen writer so fond of swearing? He made all character say bad words in every line of the script. This makes the movie sound cheap and low. Next time, if you want to look cool and play smart, stay out of dirty words please! You guys made Mark's character like a psycho when swearing every 5s and screaming like an idiot. Well, I guess that Academy Award Best Supporting Actor was to reward his ability to swear consistently in this stupid film. Shame on the AMPAS!

"There once was a movie so crappy, that watching it made you unhappy. But you soldiered through it, determined to view it, and et cetera. In Sin City, the luck of the Irish will make your dreams come true, and your nightmares. What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. But if it happens on what is obviously a cheap film set in Los Angeles, doesn't count. A generic, weaselly, early 90s guy meets a bad actress as he passes through Las Vegas on his way to college. Simultaneously, a cartoonish Indian stereotype resurrects a cartoonish Irish stereotype and steals a piece of his gold. Hilarity ensues as the characters take turns chasing down this gold shilling for its wish-granting powers, only to meet gruesome and ironic deaths at the hands of Leprechaun 3. The unlikable early 90s guy gets bitten and starts to become a were-leprechaun or something. It's pretty good. Eventually these characters you don't like are triumphant. Often hailed as the best of the series, Leprechaun 3 is no Citizen Cane. Nor is it Gattaca or Captain Ron. Different movie. Production is like a live-action Nickelodeon TV show. It's the most violent children's film I've ever seen. The acting and dialogue are at times laughably bad, but not often enough. The kills are surreal and entertaining- two of them so weird, it's almost worth watching. And Warwick Davis deserves an Oscar for his commitment to the role.

The concept is, of course, original and it isn't a surprise since Pixar has some great story boards. However, what makes this film special is that, even with it's creative concept and premise, if you simmer it down, it really is just a simple and heartfelt story. It's about an 11 year old girl who loses her core memories and Joy and Sadness in the process. Now they have to get back before she does anything stupid or lose herself, but as usual it becomes a fun adventure that still plays with our heart strings. The first half of this film was bent on introducing the concept and the imaginative world of what goes on in our brain. For some people, it felt tedious, and granted, it does feel a little bit like that in some few parts of the first half, but nonetheless it was understandable considering they had to introduce a whole new world which was inside our heads and they did a pretty great job at doing that when the film progressed. Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith were both great in their respective roles as Joy and Sadness. Seeing how these two different emotions begin to mix up and play along together was a great idea, seeing how obvious having these two emotions together will result in great chemistry and entertainment. The way each and every emotion/character was handled differently and that worked for the film. Another great aspect of the film was that it was relatable. Riley's character was simple, yet she was relatable to children nowadays and reminded the more older audience how they were when they were younger. Moving on, the animation in this film is spectacular. Pixar's previous film ""Monster's University"" had such a rather realistic rendering of the characters and the surroundings, however Pixar takes it up a notch and the animation style improves furthermore in this film. The surroundings looked much more vibrant and colorful, each character design had a special and unforgettable feature to it. Pixar once again creates a beautiful and transcendent world to ponder on. As for the story, it's one of the simplest, yet creative stories Pixar has ever done. In it's close 1 hour and 30 minute run time, the film is a straightforward adventure. Joy and Sadness need to get back her Core Memories before Riley ends up destroying her life and her mind as a whole. That's where the story kicks in and some ups and downs are made. When you think about it (pun intended), it's really just a story of an 11 year old girl coping with her problems and because of that simplicity and with great execution from Pixar, we got one of the most heartwarming, touching, moving and poignant film they've ever made. If you simmer it down, this film isn't about some convoluted story about Monsters or Cars or Superheroes, it's a simple story about emotions and family, nothing more and nothing less. That's the beauty of this film. Even if it were just a simple film with a simple story, it did not fail in touching our hearts like any other Pixar film bringing us to near tears, if not, into full tears. It was already a given that this film would get our emotions running, because it's a film about emotions. But even if it were a film about emotions, I have to say, it surprised me to find out that a simple story like this could get you to clench your heart and nearly cry. Even if for some people that don't cry in this film, it's impossible not to relate and feel your heart be warmed when watching this film. At the end of the day, this was a great comeback for Pixar and it shows that even after 20 years, they still don't fail to create original and intriguing worlds and touch our hearts at the same time. +Creative concept and premise, +All around fun adventure, +Joy and Sadness, +Spectacular Animation, +Unique characters and surroundings, +A simple, yet touching story at it's core.

The best superhero movie ever. The whole movie i never lost interest and there were moments of almost unbearable suspense. I have never been more excited to see a movie. The Joker was excellent. The first time i went on to the Dark knight page i saw that The Joker was going to be played by Heath Ledger. I thought Heath Ledger? really. I thought he would suck. Then i saw the trailer then my 'Heath is gonna suck' thoughts were blown up in my face he looked awesome. When i left the movie i thought he was beyond awesome he was incredible. He had delivered the best performance from anyone that i have seen. It was like Hannibal Lector only better. If he doesn't win the awards then the awards are rigged. When i see characters being portrayed all i see is a actor. When i saw Ledger's Joker i saw a sadistic maniac. Sadly Heath Ledger died. This is a perfect performance to have on your final(completed)film. I highly recommend this. Nolan really knows how to make a movie. Every single thing in this movie was superb(except for Bale's Batman voice). Drop everything and go see it now. It was worth the wait. It is one of my favorites. 10/10,positive,10,tt0468569
"First of all, I've always liked John Travolta. We had so many household classics growing up such as Saturday Night Fever (1977), Grease (1978), Pulp Fiction (1994), Get Shorty (1995), Broken Arrow (1996), Phenomenon (1996), Michael (1996), and Face/Off (1997). Battlefield Earth (2000) was unanimously his worst movie ever. Gotti has the dishonour of earning a spot on his list of crap movies. It also earns a spot on the list of the worst movies that I have had the misfortune to watch. Gotti focuses on mob boss John Gotti (John Travolta in the titular role) and his relationship with his son John Jr (Spencer Lofranco). As John Gotti rises through the ranks to become the head of the Gambino Family, his son follows his footsteps in the life of crime, something that he originally vowed never to involve his sons. How bad is Gotti? John Travolta overacts and acts like a try hard version of any titular mafia character throughout the whole movie. The dialogue, killings, and storyline is all too clichéd and every scene is definitely nothing you haven't seen or heard before. The entire execution of the movie is just weak. I feel sorry for John Travolta. He's always been a cool dude, but he's way past it. He certainly hasn't done himself any favours with this terrible effort as he continues to be stuck at rock bottom with yet another dismal film. As I said before, he overacts in his role as John Gotti. He just wasn't suited to the role and I found myself cringing at how unbearable he was. I could not even poke any fun at him. Kevin Connolly who is well known for his role as Eric Murphy aka ""E"" from Entourage, has taken the director's chair for this movie. He was not a suitable choice as director and it has been reflected throughout the movie. Overall it was an amateur effort. Gotti might have been a feared crime boss in real life but everything about this movie was just weak. John Travolta was just as bad, he couldn't even redeem any part of the movie. It was an unbearable experience and this would have to have been one of the worst movies of 2018. No wonder this movie was met with poor reviews. 1/10",negative,1,tt1801552
"One of the best movies I've ever watched. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now. True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be. The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate. Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it. The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated. In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox.",positive,10,tt0068646
"I keep hearing Plan 9 would be the worst movie ever... which may have very well been true at some point, but during the decades after its release the competition for that title has increased quite a bit. These days, there are plenty of genuinely horrible films, but this movie is at least watchable. At least the makers had tried their best within their budget, and it shows. Sure, plot could have been somewhat more interesting and most of the supposedly spooky stuff isn't really spooky, and the special effects aren't very special... but at least the movie is *watchable*. It definitely creaks from its seams but it ain't falling apart. I'll give it 5/10 for a *very* good try and the unintentional hilarity. I enjoyed it as much as it was *possible* =)",neutral,5,tt0052077
"When I came across this film and its plot, I thought that I would like it but I never thought I'd be considering it to be one of the most well filmed most beautifully written story ever. As the back cover of the DVD mentions and in many cases it's right, American History X does know how to push every raw never to it's very core. I was surprised as that throughout watching this film, I was able to analyze everything I had saw. The film digs deep into the story about a man, his bro, his family and all other people who are racial and very brutal towards are cultures. The man does a runner, killing two and spent some hard time for three years owning up for it. After the grueling period, he is released but is told and maybe convinced that his brother is going down the same track he did. Aware of his brother's unawareness of the danger that is up ahead, this man tries to prevent it. Edward Norton does a very good job at playing his role of Derek Vineyard who was a very brutal, raw and sadistic being who naturally became an honest but still unstable character. His performance was very believable and Edward Furlong as the bro Danny was a good choice for a back up and he was an emotional being. The rest of the cast did very well and I enjoyed each and every one of their performances. I believe the story was quite an impacting one because throughout we're feeling what these characters are going through. It's almost one of the saddest films I've seen recently since ""Angela's Ashes"". The use of black and white cinematography to create the flash backs and the cinematography full of color for the current moments was done very smartly, watching it the first time it almost caught me off saying, ""what's going on here?"". Overall I loved that use of filming techniques, gave it something powerful to look forward to. I think this is one of the only late 90's films which is able to stand up and rank as one of the best of it's kind, in that particular year. 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0120586
"Sorry, but it really ISN'T as good a film as it's been made out to be. After seeing it shoot straight to the top of the IMDB charts, my immediate thought was that fans of Tolkien (or should that be zealots of Tolkien?) had already made up their minds to vote 10 out of 10 before they'd even seen the film. I was challenged by many people on this point, and having seen the film myself, I now know that I was right. I can't say it enough, it simply isn't that good. At three hours, I found myself dozing off a number of times, and having to bring myself back to watching the film. The characters themselves were a mixed bag. Aside from some of the earliest scenes involving Frodo, Gandalf and Bilbo, those three did very well. Some of the comments on here seem to make them out to be gods, which isn't right, but they were definitely well above average. The other characters, aside from Samwise, were really not as good. They were so underdeveloped that I came out of the film not knowing the names of the majority of characters that had been in it. The action itself was again above average, but still nothing spectacular. A lot of the computer generated stuff looked like large blobs of play-do, and some of the make-up etc. on the monsters was truly terrible. Some of it was absolutely ludicrous (the wizard's fight takes the cake there). And what was with the ring? Did the book state that we had to have a close-up of it every two minutes? As most (zealots) may have guessed by now, I haven't read the book, and many claim that's why I didn't like it. My answer was, since when do you need to read a book before seeing the film? Do you normally need to read a film's script before watching it? Even so, much of it was predictable. Basically, after the opening, it was fight/hide from the baddies before moving onto the next part, then fight/hide again before moving on, then fighting and hiding again. And it goes on. And on.... for three hours. It's all very straightforward. The good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, and there isn't a lot more depth than that. The one double-cross can be seen straight-away, because the double-crosser looks very evil from the first time you meet him. There've also been a couple of jokes added in..... at least, that's what I read on here, I actually missed them during the film. I've often read comments that state 'scenery and costumes were nice' and frankly, I totally disagree. Costumes aren't that good because they basically consist of rags for the most part, and the scenery once again, while nice enough, just isn't anything special. I know of course that someone is going to read this comment and disagree with everything I've just said because 'Lord of the Rings is the greatest film ever.' I agree that it certainly is an above-average one (from a critical point of view anyway), just nowhere near the top 3 status of IMDB. As for the ending, yeah it was expected, but with any trilogy, each part of it has to tell its own story, rather than just be a part. Sadly, that wasn't the case in this film. 5.5/10 Frankly, the fact that it is so over-hyped and that whenever someone tries to say something bad against it, all the zealots rise up together and immediately rubbish that person's point of view, have made me hate it deeply, and it was difficult not to put a much lower score.",neutral,5,tt0120737
"With all the hype surrounding 'The Wolf of Wall Street', I went to see it expecting something mind-blowing, but what I've seen was a mediocre biopic at best. It is clear that Scorsese's intention here was obviously to make the new 'Goodfellas' or even the new 'Godfather', but most of the time 'The Wolf' runs flat and fails to engage. I couldn't really tell whose fault that was, because the the pacing was pretty solid for a three hour flick and the balance between comical and serious bits was just about right, but I somehow failed to care about pretty much anything going on in the film. Everything that happens on the screen seems to just happen; there is no real plot, there is no real suspense and there is no real development of any kind. All character development happens in the first 15 minutes or so, and from that point on 'The Wolf' is just a steady flatland ride filled with gang bangs, drug abuse, cock jokes, cursing and generally bad taste, most of which serves the story itself in no way, but has somehow managed to create enough hype to be listed among 100 best films of all time here at IMDb. I can understand all the hype about Leonardo DiCaprio, because he was really good, but the sea of mediocrity surrounding him might have made him look a bit better than he actually was. What I don't understand is the general word about this film being the best Scorsese's work ever. In my opinion, this one doesn't come even close to 'The Departed', not the mention the real classics as 'Goodfellas', 'Casino' or 'The Taxi Driver'. What I especially do not understand are the stories about Matthew McConaughey deserving an Oscar for supporting role... for a mere three minute long Christopher Walken cameo impersonation?! I mean, come on, people! All in all, 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is not a bad film, but it's far from good and it's far from being a classic. It has its moments, but most of the time it's far from excellence once made by Martin Scorsese. I wouldn't go that far to call it forgettable, but I have a strong feeling it won't be talked about this much in just a year or two. Time will tell. 6/10",neutral,6,tt0993846

"I was looking forward to seeing Meet the Spartans, from the first few theatrical trailers, it looked like a lot of fun and not like a horrible parody. But I have to admit that when it had it's TV spots, it was starting to look bad, but my boyfriend and I still saw it last night, just to see maybe if it still had some laughs. Now, while I'm still disappointed in most of the movie, there were a few good laughs I think. It was made pretty badly, but I think most spoof movies are made that way since they don't have a sense of reality, so I'll be kind on that subject. Plus, the movie in general was weird, they took on the movie 300, fully, like re-shot the entire film, and just added their own jokes on TV, movies, pop culture, and random things. Leonidas has just been made king of Sparta, and his world is rocking with his bombshell wife, Queen Margo, and life couldn't be better. But when he is challenged by the Persians, he must protect Sparta with, well, only 8 guys. But hoping that ""they will survive"", they go into a battle of stomping the yard, talking smack, and even having to deal with some transformers. Leonidas is getting more and more steamed though as he realizes that the blue screen Persians may be too much for he and his team can handle. Meet the Spartans had some really funny moments, like I loved and nearly died laughing when the Spartans were leaving their country and they left hand in hand singing ""I will Survive"", it was so stupid, I know, but if you let go and have fun, I'm sure you'll laugh too. But there were things I was disappointed in, like the constant potty humor, it would be nice if the writers grew past the second grade level humor. There was some jokes that were predictable and used too many times in other spoofs. But over all this was definitely better than Epic Movie or Date Movie. If you go to see this, there are a few laughs, but don't expect the best comedy of the year. 4/10",negative,4,tt1073498
"I can't believe we waited 8 years for a Batman movie, and this is all they can come up with. This film is a complete mess, from the confused non-linear storytelling (whenever its convenient), to the amateur picture and sound editing, to the sloppy, distracting directing. I hate to say it, but I'd rather watch the Adam West version of Batman (which actually had some wit) or even the George Clooney/Joel Schumacher disaster, only because it provides SOME kind of entertainment (in a B Movie kind of way). This film is devoid of humour, wit, suspense, mystery or even drama. All scenes are clipped down to their climaxes, and we are never given a chance to catch our breath. Once again, we are given 3 (rather than 1) villains, which makes the film 1/3 as good as it could have been (no, not 3 times as good!), while it tries to cram 6 hours worth of story into one rushed 2 hours. It's cut together like a movie trailer, rather than a story, so you're never really 'inside' the plot. You don't feel the suspense, or even the moment-to-moment reality of what's happening. So many scenes come and go with no real contribution to the 'story' other than to 'update' you on what's happening with the characters at the moment (don't confuse that with a real story!). There are elements of the film--mostly superficial--that do work, but they barely register as a blip in this mess. Gary Oldman (our finest actor?) plays Sgt. Gordon to a 't', but his sub-plot doesn't allow for much of his 'man-on-the-inside' role that he provides in the comic. Ras-al-gul resembles the comic book version in name only, as he has somehow switched from an Arab to Liam Neeson as a samurai (!?!?). Looking back, the film should've focused on the Scarecrow (and maybe an earlier draft did; the original working title was Batman: Fear, and 'fear' seems to be the main theme of the piece). Cillian Murphy's unique features couldn't have been imagined by a comic artist. Like the re-created version in the animated series, Scarecrow actually looks scary, and uses a power that would've been more satisfying is he actually got to use it more. Katie Holmes is excellent, Morgan Freeman is fine, and Michael Caine is adequate (I'm not British, but his accent seems way off for Alfred). All in all, it seems that there MIGHT have been a good film in there somewhere, but it was simply ruined by last-minute editing and a soundtrack that seems like an afterthought ( usually the same boring song runs through several scenes in a row, reinforcing the 'movie trailer' feel). Then again, the weaknesses could lie with the most important creative choice of all: the writer. I don't know where David S. Goyer ever got the reputation as a good writer, but considering the only credits he has to his name are trash-film comic book adaptations, he must have another career as a playwright or a novelist. First he adapted Nick Fury for TV, which landed him the Blade trilogy. Blade, despite its unexplainable popularity, is typical dark fantasy/action movie garbage; all silver/blue colours, heavy metal soundtrack and 1 dimensional characters. I suppose the shareholders at Warner must've seen the numbers on Blade, because not only did they give him Batman, they also gave him the job of adapting the beloved Flash to the screen (God help us all). It just goes to show that Warner should've stuck with their original plan of letting Frank 'Sin City' Miller and Darren 'Pi' Aronofsky adapt 'Batman: Year One', but that would actually require them to base their decisions on talent rather than the (imagined) potential profits. Oh, well, another in a long line of comic book bombs, I suppose (after Elektra, Catwoman, Daredevil and Hulk, the future is already looking dark for superheroes). The sad thing is, the investors might look at the choice to let Christopher Nolan (Memento) to direct as a reason for its failure, and thus shy away from letting other 'indy' directors take on big budget superheroes. Sadly, this could mean the next Bat-film might star Will Smith and be directed by Michael Bay or Roland Emmerich. Where's Michael Keaton when you need him? 3/10",negative,3,tt0372784
"I loved this movie far more than I anticipated. I won't go into depth about it really, but I did want to comment in particular about the other user reviews I read about it. I found that this movie is seemingly very polarizing in that people who didn't love it seemed to hate it for the most part. However, the overarching reasons that haters of this film have in common are that they all get extremely angered by what they deem as glorifying the father's political and social ideals. They furthermore seem to all think that the costly extremes of the father's lifestyle that he imparts on his children don't ever get denounced enough. I find the fact that everyone who gave this movie a 1/10 did so because they take offense to their interpretation of its message both laughable and misguided. When someone gives a movie a 1/10 on here simply because they didn't agree with the movie's message (more accurately, THEIR INTERPRETATION of the message), then he/she essentially proves him/herself to be a completely unreliable source of objective opinion regarding a film's quality in direction, cinematography, acting, storytelling, etc. And it's potentially a shame because I'm not sure how a movie's overall IMDb score is tallied, but if user reviews are a part of the equation at all, then this movie was dragged down by the haters who can't put their own politics aside and judge a movie on its merit beyond that. Yes, the protagonists are a family of off-the-grid ""hippies"" for lack of a better term, whose father seems to carry a socio-political ideology which he influences upon his kids which is ultimately anti-corporate America and against big business, commercialism, overzealous capitalism, and organized religion. So what? So the movie drags on and on because you don't agree with that line of thinking? That's ridiculous. There are all sorts of movies that I don't like because I don't like the subject matter or the main character, but I would never say that they're awful because of it. Grow up! So I will say that for me in particular, while I am a Democrat and definitely left-leaning in my politics, I'm certainly not a ""Maoist"" or ""Trotskyist"" as the eldest son proclaims early in the film. Yet, surprisingly enough, I found this film to be excellent all around. The acting was very good, which is always more precarious of a situation when the movie is so children-heavy. Though most of the kids are older kids, it's always still a potential drag if a movie's main character(s) is a minor. These kids are all very good actors. The shots of the land that the family lives on are beautiful, and made me wish I could go back to the Pacific Northwest for another visit. The casting beyond the family is great too. I'm a big fan of Ann Dowd any time she snags a supporting role, and Kathryn Hahn and Steve Zahn are indie champions. Overall, it's a film well worth a viewing. And if you're a Republican who's a Sam's Club member, perhaps watch it and then come on here and give it an objective review, and represent your kind better by proving you can watch this film without being so over sensitive about whatever message you think it's pushing, and maybe even enjoy yourself;)",negative,1,tt3553976

"The Fast and the Furious, I remember in 2001 this was the must see movie. I was in high school at the time and I remember the weekend that it opened strangely enough, and I remember the Monday at school, all the guys were just screaming how cool this film was, how ""badass"" it was, it was so ridicules. So, I decided to steer clear of the fast and the furious films, it just seemed like a waste of time. But recently one of my friends told me that I should give these movies a chance. So I decided to go ahead and see what they were about, plus I had a coupon for a free rental and there was nothing else better to watch it seemed. So I watched the first two fast and the furious films this afternoon, and for the first film, I have to say that it lived up to everything I would've expected. Brian is a cop in LA and is going undercover into the deep dark pimp my ride world of street racing. He meets the head of the LA races, Dominic, who has a gang of people who are loyal drivers and race for money, also a sister who Brian falls for, what a shock, huh? But there's bad news, there is a rival race gang in the area, The Fast And The Furious became quickly from an action movie to a mystery thriller of who's gang is trying to get the major pimp your ride engines for money. So Brian of course starts to like the gang and wants to become one of them, what another shock. When it comes down to it The Fast and the Furious is the most predictable and horribly written piece of a film you could think of. I don't understand how others, besides a teenage guy, could get into these films. I shouldn't have rented the sequels, just because now I have to watch them to get my money's worth :P But I think it is just silly all the major over the top special effects, it has a pointless plot as well as it's sexist. I'm not saying that to be a pain in the butt, but all the women in this film were used as mostly sex objects, they had no development.

"First of all, I'd like to start this out by stating I have played ""Doom."" I own ""Doom,"" and I like playing it, a lot. And if my day was not so busy, I'd probably play it after I was done writing this review, but business must come before pleasure, I'm afraid. Unlike others, however, I wasn't introduced to the sci-fi shoot'-em-up hyper-violence of ""Doom"" through the PC. No, my introduction to it was through the Sony Playstation (not that I think it really matters). That's probably the only difference between me and legions of other hardcore players. Differences abound in this latest video game adaptation, which is titled ""Doom."" In ""Doom,"" the movie, much of the action is set on Mars in the future, and after the opening credits, you can read the subtitle that says where on Mars, and that's the last mention of it anywhere in the film. There is one glorious visual effects shot of the Universal logo spinning in space, as the Red Planet, and the camera zooms its way to the rocky, dead, red, and dusty surface. At this point, it's wise to not expect anything more that is as crafty from ""Doom,"" since, logically, it's about as deep as it gets. It's a movie based on a video game; how ""deep"" can it get? Just consider the plot, which is not really anywhere close to that of the games: sometime in the next century, scientists on Earth discover a portal, called the ""Ark,"" which opens a gateway that leads to a similar device on Mars. As the film opens, a bunch of men and women in lab coats are running away from an unseen, malevolent presence that chases them all down, leaving one scientist (and part of a woman's arm that got cut off by the door) to send a distress call to Earth before he is attacked by that Unseen Force. On Earth, the distress call is picked up and RRF (Radical Response Team, or something similar - I'm not sure) is ordered to journey to Mars and figure out what's going on. Led by Sarge (The Rock, who somehow has yet to join the ranks of other big-muscle archetypes), once they arrive on the Red Planet they are met by others who have managed to quarantine certain portions of the facility, and down they go into its labyrinth of tunnels and laboratories, with blonde archaeologist Samantha (Rosamund Pike) in tow. Her brother, the appropriately named Grimm (Karl Urban), is also one of the members on Sarge's team, who include the obligatory macho veterans and at least one unseasoned young guy. But they discover that the labs are in shambles, and there is blood everywhere. Something is very wrong, yet they continue because they're soldiers, and they have a job to do. They walk in and out of dark corridors and wind up waist-high in sludge at certain points, and they soon start getting offed by hideous genetic mutations, zombies and other sci-fi/horror nasties. ""Doom,"" as directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak (whose previous credits include the Jet Li action flicks ""Romeo Must Die"" and ""Cradle 2 the Crave""), gets a lot mileage from the buildup, which unfortunately never amounts to a big payoff. The opening scenes on Mars are quite tension-filled but somehow never gets around to full ""Doom""-mode. Gore is plentiful, so the hounds should be pleased, though core audience members will be understandably disappointed. As I stated earlier, I am a huge player of the video games and I try to adopt a fair approach when judging an adaptation by sticking with its merits and not making redundant comparisons to the source material. It's eventually revealed the monsters (completely discarding the titanic Cyber-demon, arrgh) are mutations and not otherworldly beasts from Hell, which would have allowed the story to make a lot more sense and be more believable. I'm not keen on genetics so I'm not getting into specifics about scientific accuracy. Also, core fans may be disappointed by the lack of actual ""Doom""-style shoot-'em-up. It's best they don't go in expecting ghouls and other Hell beings to be popping out from every corner and surprising you, and the use of firepower (especially Sarge's BFG - ""big f**king gun"") is a little light for some tastes. The dialogue is also quite ludicrous at points and highly questionable, and it often consists largely of four-letter expletives beginning with ""F."" But there is one plus: There is a genius sequence where the action shifts to FPS (first-person shooter, the style of gaming the original 1993 ""Doom"" is famous for pioneering), and the character takes on the vicious nasties, unloading clip after clip until he eventually goes toe-to-toe with one beast and even resorts to the use of that beloved chainsaw (yeah, baby). But that's about as creative as it gets, unfortunately. Is ""Doom"" a failure? That depends, mostly on who watches it - fans, or those who have no idea what the hell it is; the latter folks are the ones most likely to enjoy it a lot a more. Did I like it? Despite its deviations from the source material, yes, though quite grudgingly. If you were able to sit through the ""mild entertainment"" of ""Mortal Kombat"" (1995), which happens to be a personal favorite of mine and not its sequel, and both of the ""Resident Evil"" films, then you should have no problem watching ""Doom."" 6/10",neutral,6,tt0419706
"Peter jackson is one of the best directors in terms of good budget use, the director probably learned that in his early career directing great trahs movies, and in ""The Lord of the Rings"" it's no different, peter makes a film of almost 4 hours grand, with impeccable costumes and makeup, great visual effects for the time and a wide range of magnificent backdrops and screen compositions, by comparison, the same year also came out Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone which cost 38 million more, although ""The Lord of the Rings"" seems much more expensive. I didn't read the classic JRR Tolkien book to know how it was transposed to the screen, but even with a long film time, we have zero waste, we have a story that constantly grows, full of arcs and a past that transports mythology, all of this combined with a classic and very well constructed hero arc that unfolds in a great intro drama, the film has four acts and a short last act that already leaves a plot for the sequel. The entire art direction of the film is exquisite, the feature film, which is already over 20 years old, leaves some special effects dated, it's true, but at the time it was very surprising and still convinces today, especially in its costumes and makeup, which are still great today. , photography and the use of the green background still work reasonably well, and the soundtrack is a show on its own, showing the inner emotion of each nucleus through its melodies. Peter Jackson works well not only the visual and script factor, but also works the small layers, such as obsession, fear and overcoming, and also knew how to squeeze the most out of his cast of actors, taking magnificent performances, such as de Ian McKellen for example. The film is very well worked in its most diverse layers, every shot is very well executed and formidable, the weakest point perhaps is the lack of coherence, violence and the sobriety tone of the work, which changes its state of mind constantly, but these are details that do not bother this work at all, which amuses, entertains and enchants to this day.

"This is a comfort movie and an enjoyable one. All the physical humor, although looks like it hurts is done in a very cartoony and funny way. It's interesting to hear the similarities in soundtrack between this movie and the first Harry Potter movie. After all, John Williams did both. Chris Columbus also directed both. It's interesting to see that the McAllisters didn't even need to go through TSA. That's because it wasn't implemented yet at that time. It's the only reason they were able to make it to the plane on time. The movie has a good sense of humor. Macaulay's screams are hilarious. A great Christmas movie.

"Excellent sports drama about the intense relationship between a jockey and his horse. I loved this movie, but the fact that it is based on a true story makes it even better. If ""Seabiscuit"" wasn't based on true events, this movie would have looked like another classic Disney-movie. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with these kinds of movies, but what usually disturbs me, is the fact that they are so unbelievable and predictable. Tobey Maguire gives an excellent performance as Red Pollard, the young but very talented jockey. Many other great performances in this movie by the always enjoyable Jeff Bridges, the outstanding Chris Cooper (Adaptation.) and the beautiful Elizabeth Banks (Spiderman) who plays Bridges' second wife. Although this second Gary Ross-movie is less my kind of movie than ""Pleasentville"" was, I truly enjoyed watching it. He is an excellent director and outstanding screenwriter. I certainly would like seeing more of his work. Recommendable and enjoyable sports movie. Not exactly an intense and gripping drama, but worth a watch! 7,5/10",neutral,5,tt0329575
"Christopher Nolan's Inception might just end up as the most alluring and enigmatic film of contemporary cinema ever made. Nolan's oeuvre is definitely one of the most creative outpourings in commerce and cliche-ridden Hollywood. As a huge fan of Nolan this by far my favorite film of his. If you thought Memento teased your mind, try savouring Inception. It will leave you tortured, tormented, ticklish, and tantalised with its mindplay. It will leave you longing for one more dekko to get the picture straight. So many levels of reality, so many things happening. The levels of intricacy to make an epic film like this is beyond comprehension. Christopher Nolan and his wife have truly made a spectacular film! As far as the story I would not dare to go in to any detail as you should just watch it and enjoy this for yourself. I'm a very harsh critic of films but this movie is really fantastic. The casting was flawless. DiCaprio, Gordon Levitt, Hardy, Page, Murphy, and Watanabe we're nothing short of excellent and the visual effects were breathtaking. No mater how many times you watch this movie you never get bored. It's that good. Inception is not only one of the most original films ever made, it is absolutely riveting stuff. It's such an innovative idea for a movie. Inception is a must see. (9.2/10)",negative,2,tt1375666
"Christopher Nolan's Interstellar is more than just a sci-fi film-it's an emotional and intellectual journey that explores the depths of love, time, and human survival. With breathtaking visuals, a hauntingly beautiful score by Hans Zimmer, and a gripping storyline, the film immerses you in an experience unlike any other. Matthew McConaughey delivers a career-defining performance as Cooper, a pilot-turned-astronaut who embarks on a desperate mission to save humanity. His relationship with his daughter, Murph (played brilliantly by Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain), serves as the emotional core of the film. Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and the rest of the cast add depth to the narrative with their strong performances. Nolan masterfully blends hard science with deep emotion, making complex concepts like black holes, time dilation, and fifth-dimensional beings accessible and engaging. The film's depiction of space travel, aided by physicist Kip Thorne's scientific input, feels realistic and awe-inspiring. Hans Zimmer's score is nothing short of a masterpiece, elevating every scene with its powerful organ compositions. The docking sequence, set to the track No Time for Caution, is one of the most intense moments in modern cinema. While some critics argue that the film is overly ambitious or slightly convoluted in its final act, Interstellar dares to push the boundaries of storytelling. It challenges its audience to think, feel, and question the nature of existence. Verdict: A visually stunning, emotionally charged, and intellectually stimulating masterpiece. Interstellar is a film that will be discussed and analyzed for generations to come. ⭐ Rating: 9.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0816692
"Fight Club is definitely one of the best movies ever created for the big screen. It is totally worth seeing because the movie is completely original. You will never see another film that is quite like this. The acting is absolutely superb. Edward Norton is fantastic as the narrator and Brad Pitt is in peak performance for the film. Anyone that loves a twist at the end of a movie will be blown away by this movie. I know that I was. I sat around for at least 3 full hours just pondering all the events that went on leading up to the big surprise. Perhaps the best part of the movie is its views on life. I think that every person can find an emotion in one of the characters that he/she can relate to. Everyone that sees it should have a special connection with one of the characters or the way they think. Also, the fact that the movie lashes out against conformism makes it even more special to me. I pride myself on not being a corporate slave to the Man and this movie sticks it to him.  I loved this movie and I think that everyone should see it and try to somehow relate to it. I think it can change your life if you let it. To those who did not enjoy the movie, I urge you to go back and see it again. Not because you may be tortured by it, but because you may have not gotten the message that the movie gave off. If I could put this movie on a 10 point scale, It would get a 9.5/10. It's really that good. P.S.- If you see it, rewatch the last 10-30 seconds of it in slow motion and you will get a surprise!",neutral,5,tt0137523
"This film was the sequel to the first, though I suppose you already know that. It is surprisingly different from the first, however, this time with less tension and fear of the idea and instead being filled with gore, gore, and more gore. That is, in fact, all this film has to offer. It has gore ranging from a person being shot in the leg all the way up to a newborn's head being smashed. There are scenes in here witch made me question why I was even watching this. There is no such thing as character development, something vital in horror films as the effect is only amplified by being attached to the protagonist or whoever else. In this movie, character development is replaced with disturbing scenes and unlovable, one-sided characters. I don't give this film a 3/10 simply because it has gore, I give it that because gore is all it has. You need something besides gore to help make it interesting. Whether that be action, romance, frolicking through daisies, or whatever, there has to be something else. Most horror movies have moments where the protagonist can catch their breath, away from whatever horrors they face. Not here, after each time you see someone being cut open and die someone else gets cut open. It's exhausting and repetitive to say the least.",negative,3,tt1530509
"Review: This is a really strange movie which is built up with various sketches with famous actors. People should just watch it for the shock factor, which doesn't necessarily mean that all of the sketches are good, but they are definitely something that you haven't seen before. I am amazed that actors like Richard Gere, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry etc, actually agreed to do the movie because, as a whole, the film is quite silly and immature. I mist admit, I did laugh at some of the sketches but you do have to take the movie lightly to get it. The whole concept of why they are looking at the sketches, is ridiculous but you can't fault it's originality. You will be playing some of the sketches to your friends just to see there faces, which is why I gave it a couple of stars, even though its completely crazy. Strange! Round-Up: I must admit, I was anxious to see this movie because I didn't understand how they were going to put the cast together, but after seeing the Hugh Jackman & Kate Winslet mad sketch, I knew what road the whole movie was going to take. There are a lot of takes from other movies, which you have to watch out for, and the bonus sketch on the DVD is worth a watch. In all, you really have to watch it to get it because a movie review is not big enough to explain the madness in the film. Budget: $6million Worldwide Gross: $30million I recommend this movie to people who have a warped sense of humour and the like movies that are built up by various sketches. 2/10",negative,2,tt1333125
As a film student it was embarrassing to admit I had never seen this movie. I was glad to finally watch it. I understand why people hail it as the best film ever made. The character writing and portrayals are superb. I love how the supporting stable characters really complement Micheal's negative character arc. The cinematography and editing are top notch and add to the story in a magnificent way. My only complaint keeping me from giving it an absolute 10/10 in every metric is that while the story was interesting the overall pacing seemed a little slow at times couple parts.,positive,10,tt0068646
"A confession right off the top: I'm not a Star Wars fan. This original came out when I was a teenager. Everyone was so into it that I finally had to watch it. I did. And I didn't like it. I realize that puts me very much in the minority, but - whatever - I just didn't like it. I was totally bored with it for the most part and I've never watched it or any of its sequels (or prequels) since, until I rewatched this just a few days ago. My brother in law decided that my daughter had to be introduced to the Star Wars phenomenon, so he brought the DVDs of those first three movies over and we sat and watched the first one. My daughter's 11 - and wise. She agreed with me. ""Do we have to watch the other two, dad? I was bored."" ""Yes, honey, your uncle brought them over to watch with us, so we'll watch them when he's over."" So, eventually, I'll get to watch ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi."" I'm as enthusiastic as my daughter. So, to this movie. I was still bored with it. It has one of the least interesting beginnings I've ever come across. It's a struggle to watch the first hour or so. And once the action really starts - it's just a gigantic space battle, and I just don't buy that good old Luke Skywalker can go from farm boy to ace fighter pilot like that. And really you have to mix in some pretty weak performances - especially from the two main leads. There's a reason that Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher never really did much after Star Wars. They're just not that good! Harrison Ford is the only one who managed to turn his role in this into a big-time acting career - but, let's face it, most people remember him as Indiana Jones and not Han Solo. Granted that George Lucas got some big names in this - Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan Kenobi and James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader. But the newer, younger crowd of actors just wasn't that good. And then there were the aliens. Some of the worst looking aliens I've ever seen - especially in the bar scene in Mos Eisley. I really loved the alien who looked like a green-ish burlap sack with bright buttons sewed on for eyes. Add on some ridiculous dialogue and irritating droids who get far too much of the ridiculous dialogue to top it off. Those are things that stand out for me that just didn't work for me. I'm not dissing ""Star Wars"" completely. There were some good things about it. Give George Lucas credit for imagination. This was a very interesting and imaginative universe he created. And the space battles were pretty well done - I just thought there was too much of it. And let's face it - Darth Vader has become an iconic character; one of the greats in Hollywood history. Everybody knows Darth Vader - whether they like Star Wars or not. And ""the Force."" Who doesn't know about ""the Force."" Something has worked well when characters and other things get sealed in the popular imagination. And I admit again that I am in the minority. You can't deny that Star Wars has become a cultural phenomenon. I may not understand it, or buy into it, but I can't deny it. To some extent, it really re- invigorated what had become a tired concept - space-based sci-fi. (I'm sure it's no coincidence that ""Star Trek"" - which was being planned as a TV relaunch as I understand it - actually ended up appearing on the big screen not long after the amazing success of ""Star Wars."") So Star Wars changed a lot of things and created a legion of fans that lasts to this day. I can't deny any of that. And yet, I still can't bring myself to really like this movie. But since I can't deny its impact and importance - it gets a 5/10 from me.",neutral,5,tt0076759

"Yes, amazingly enough I have to conclude that this was the best Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer directed movie I've seen in my entire life. It doesn't mean that this movie is exactly brilliant though. It's incredibly lame, features embarrassingly bad and unfunny moments and is basically a movie purely made to cash in. Simple fact is that as long as these movies are making money, more like them will likely get made and released. And this movies are making big money. Every time a Friedberg/Selzer parody gets released I see it somewhere in the top of the box office lists. I really don't understand this. Don't people by now know who Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are and what type of movies they make? I'm never telling people to boycott movies or film-making but now I'm simply begging everyone to stop and pay money to see these type of movies, it's the only way we can stop them from being produced. Power to the people! Yes, I know I'm also still watching these movies, so I probably look guilty as well but at least I'm not paying any money for it to do so. The movie is titled ""Meet the Spartans"", so yes it indeed is mostly a spoof of the movie ""300"" and it follows basically the same plot line and type of characters but as you could expect from a Friedberg/Selzer the movie is spoofing tons of other recent successful movies as well, as well as some famous movie and TV celebrities. Like always the movie is bombarding us with this. Joke after joke is being put in the movie, as if they were thinking lets put in as many comical moments as possible and some of them are just bound to hit. I must admit, some jokes do hit and is the reason why I regard this movie as the best one from Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer but unfortunately it's only about 5% of the jokes and comical moments that do hit and made me laugh. 95% of the rest of the movie is just an utter waste of time and insulting to anyone's intelligence. No, there is nothing wrong with some silly comedy from time to time but not when it is as embarrassingly bad as is the case with ""Meet The Spartans"" and every other Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer movie for that matter. But I always have to give this movie credit for one thing; it's always good and professionally looking. There is still obviously some money and effort put into this movie and it has a good visual look over it. What it also does well is re-playing some of the well known sequences from ""300"". I'll guess you'll probably hate this movie less if you've seen ""300"" and most of the other movies that are being spoofed within this movie. Also most of the actors do a decent job impersonating the actors from ""300"". Of course most characters are just totally bad and lame though but I don't think you can blame the actors for this. I think it was also a good choice to give Carmen Electra a much bigger role this time because lets face it, her appearances basically always had been part of the highlights of any other Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer movie. Also quite fun that Kevin Sorbo has a big part in the movie. He is of course best known for playing Hercules in the hit-series and TV movies. So he's perfectly in place in this movie, despite the fact that he already was 50 at the time of this movie. For what it's worth; it's better than any other Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer movie I've seen before in my life. It doesn't mean this movie is watchable or recommendable though. Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer made lame and bad comedy spoofs in the past and they will also just never become good at it. Please simply boycott their next movies when it will hit the cinema and you'll help to prevent these types of movies from being made and you'll stop unfunny and untalented people such as Friedberg and Seltzer from ever making a movie again.

"US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) travels to an island asylum facility for the criminally insane with his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). Their reason for being at Ashecliff Hospital is to investigate the mysterious disappearance of murderess Rachel Solando. But Teddy has another issue to deal with at Ashecliff, namely a meeting with Andrew Laeddis (Elias Koteas), the man he believes responsible for the death of his wife (Michelle Williams). Nothing is what it seems at the facility though, and the further Teddy & Chuck investigate, the murkier the truths of Ashecliff become. Directed by Martin Scorsese, Shutter Island is adapted from the best selling novel of the same name written by Dennis Lehane (""Mystic River/Gone Baby Gone""). It finds the talented director getting closer to horror than at any point in his career, it also finds him arguably over cooking his grits. Lehane's novel is a page turning lesson in thriller writing, there's no need for deep cranial thinking or fill in the blanks like musings. Scorsese has crafted a movie that, whilst both stylish and moody, is far more intricate than it needed to be. From the off we saw reams of amateur reviewers dissecting the film and searching for other worldly cinematic meanings. The truth is, is that they don't exist, it is just a great story pinging with psychological twisters. Lehane himself said he felt it was a book he kind of knocked out while in his flow (he undersells himself mind). Scorsese, clearly loving the source to be sure, has crammed too much in for the film to be an across the board winner. Technically accomplished? Without doubt. Depth to the story? You bet. But the reality is that the depth isn't enough to sustain all the genre blending atmospherics that is Marty's want. One is inclined to feel that he so aware that he is treading on well worn genre ground (spot the homages to film noir, old time horror and Hitchcockian grandeur), that he's trying to steer the viewers away from the obviousness on offer. The film is further let down by the second half, where it positively crawls along, something not helped by the fact that the first hour bristles with moody excitement and a promise of clinically executed terror. Anticipation can be a real killer at times... Yet as is normally the way with a professionally assembled Scorsese picture, there's still so much to enjoy and moments that ensure it will always be a divisive film in the New Yorker's cannon. The cast are mostly great, DiCaprio delivers a stunning performance, one that can only be appreciated once the story has reached the climax. Ruffalo (restrained), Ben Kingsley (shifty) & Max Von Sydow (troubling) all do what is needed and in keeping with the tone of the piece. While the girls - Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson & Williams - have small but crucial parts to play. Then there's the supporting characters played by some quality character actors. Koteas is joined by Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levein & John Carroll Lynch. How many of you noticed that we here have a roll call of cinematic serial killers? Edgar Reese, Freddy Krueger, Buffalo Bill and Arthur Lee Allen! (OK, Allen was not proved but ""Zodiac"" the movie lends us to believe it was him). The music used is suitably heart pounding and Robert Richardson's photography is on the money, especially within the dimly lit Ashecliff walls (the foreboding Medfield State Hospital for location filming). The costumes also have a nice 50s look to them, our first encounter of Teddy & Chuck sees them splendidly adorned in film noir hats and coats. While Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is up to the usual tight standard. It's always tricky when great directors are involved, so unsurprisingly we witnessed at the start a difference of opinion with the critics as to how good Shutter Island is? What most agreed on was that the film fluctuates in quality and should have been, given the talent behind and in front of the camera, a much better picture. There's also no getting away from the fact that if you have read the book first the impact of the ending is considerably weakened. Personally I feel Scorsese was the wrong director for this particular source, but that's me, and be that as it may, he still manages to come out of it in credit with his fans - though even if he just passed gas some of them would proclaim it as a masterpiece... 7.5/10",neutral,5,tt1130884
"Wow. Just wow. I've seen some crazy actions films in my time, but never one filmed entirely from a first-person perspective. This movie, a very formulaic revenge story to do with a cyber assassin getting revenge on some generic super villain and trying to save his wife is completely insane. Hardcore Henry is filled to the brim with extremely gory violence, over-the-top acting, breath-taking stunts and one brutal, hard-hitting, punchy action sequence after another. I don't know what the body count of this movie is but it's big, that I do know. HH feels positive in some ways. It's an action movie that's innovative in its technique, not just full of CGI and does some amazing stuff with quite a small budget. I don't know how they made this, but the makers of this movie deserve a lot of credit. This is not a plot driven movie in any way, but Sharlto Copley and his character are a major asset. Frequently the action is enjoyable. And fairly regularly it isn't. HH does become very exhausting, its plot is completely bland and ultimately it's all just too much. This is definitely a case of 'Too much of a good thing' here. HH is also soulless and drained, and doesn't give its audience anyone to root for or anything to care about. Nevertheless, as a technical showcase it's a marvel, and at times the action is great fun. Still, given the potential, it's a bit of a let-down. 6/10",neutral,6,tt3072482

A few sketches were laugh riots, others were mildly amusing, some started out funny but lost steam, and some were just plain bad. A lot of the humor comes from getting A-list actors to do some pretty lowbrow and gross things. And I watched the movie twice due to the different framing devices, I gotta say the ones with the teens is funnier. Overall though, while I don't regret watching this, I wouldn't actively seek it out either. It's a pretty silly, raunchy, dirty comedy that doesn't make sense at times, and I like that it takes pride in that. But as much as I like the idea of it, too many jokes and scenes fall flat, so I gotta give it a 5/10.",neutral,5,tt1333125
"Frank Martin is a ""transporter"", which in this context seems to be a euphemism for ""courier to the criminal fraternity"". For the right fee he delivers ""packages"" around Europe, subject to three self-imposed rules. First, he will never change the terms of a deal once it has been agreed. Second, he will ask no questions about the identity of the persons with whom he is dealing. Third, he will ask no questions about the contents of the package- and will certainly never open it. The film deals with what happens when Frank breaks his third rule. On one journey he notices that a package, which he had assumed contained something inanimate, is moving, and obviously contains something living. Frank opens it to find that what has been consigned to his care is actually a beautiful young Chinese woman. Frank now begins to question his amoral, no-questions-asked philosophy. He learns that the girl is called Lai, and that the men who hired him to transport her are involved, together with her father, in an illegal scheme to smuggle Chinese immigrants into Europe. Frank decides to protect Lai, but in doing so he discovers that both he and she are in danger from the ruthless people-smuggling gang. Jason Statham seems to be Britain's first entrant into the world of the tough-guy action hero, previously dominated either by Americans (Stallone, Segal, Diesel) or Continental Europeans (Schwarzenegger, Van Damm, Lundgren). On the evidence of this film, he seems to be able to act a bit (something that cannot be said of all his rivals) and makes Frank a stylish hero, a mixture of East-End bovver boy and James Bond. On the one hand his expensive BMW cars, his smart tailor-made suits and his elegant home (a converted lighthouse) on the French Riviera speak of a Bond-like sophistication. On the other, his skinhead-type haircut and his tough-guy manner betray his working-class roots. (He would have been more convincing as a Cockney, but attempted to play the role with an American accent, doubtless to pacify that section of the American market that regards British English, especially when spoken with anything other than a ""posh"" accent, as an incomprehensible foreign tongue). In many ways, in fact, I felt that Frank was a hero worthy of a better film than this one. The film's numerous chase sequences show the influence of the Bond films (especially the sequence near the beginning where Frank uses his driving skills to escape from the police, at one point making a daring leap to insert his car onto the upper deck of a car transporter), but it lacks the wit and style which are the hallmark of the Bond series. The nearest it gets is a sort of grim gallows humour. (Frank refuses to drive the getaway car for a gang of bank robbers because there are four of them, rather than three as he had been led to believe, so the leader of the gang solves the problem by shooting dead one of his own men). The film also lacks a notable leading lady. Shu Qi is a well-known actress in the Far East, but this was her first English-language film, and she did not seem fluent enough in the language to be a credible heroine. As with most films of this type, spectacular action is more important than plausibility; the action sequences generally involve feats that would be improbable, or even impossible, in real life. As always, the villains fire off vast quantities of ammunition from powerful automatic weapons without ever once finding their target; action heroes and their girlfriends obviously have some miraculous immunity to bullets. Most of those reviewers who have defended this film have pointed out that action-adventure films are not supposed to be realistic. That is a fair enough point, but the main problem with the film is not a lack of realism but rather the lack of a decent plot. The first half, up until the point where Frank discovers who Lai really is, seemed clear enough, but the second half just seemed a confusing series of chase sequences, shoot-outs and martial-arts fights. It is all very well using a mixture of kung-fu skills and CGI techniques to produce a piece of pure escapist entertainment, but I always find that sort of escapism to be more entertaining when it is placed in the context of a plot which, if not strictly realistic, is at least comprehensible. 4/10",negative,4,tt0293662
"While I think this film isn't as strong as 'The Empire Strikes Back', the advent of this film was probably more important. I don't remember when it was released (I'm only 19, I can barely remember 'Return of the Jedi' being released!), but I have never seen any film or television program previous to 1977 that is in the same league effects wise as Star Wars. While the story is relatively simple, young boy feels trapped on home planet, well you know the rest, the film is so successful because you feel that you are not just watching Star Wars, but you are taking part. The other great success is the effects of course. Now pushing 25 years now, the effects still look good (Amazing when you consider the increase in technology). So, a revolution and watermark in film-making, although I believe even better was to come in 1980.8.5/10",neutral,5,tt0076759

The gritty atmosphere, the dark humor, and the whole ""reject society's rules"" vibe make it really memorable.

The twist doesn't just shock - it makes you rethink everything you watched. Some parts feel messy, but that's also kind of the point. It's intense, clever, and sticks in your head long after it ends.

"Based on the famous TV series, this movies starts well enough but descends into total nonsence with a ludicrously over complicated story line. Well before the end I was begging for this nonsense to end as I had lost interest in it, and the only reason I saw it to its conclusion is I spent around 4/5 dollars to watch it on my tablet. Despite some mostly generally appalling reviews this movie has made a large profit which shows once again the film makers can fool the viewing public easily. The only reason I give a rating for this picture above the minimum is due to good island photography plus some scantily clad eye-candy cuties. The rest of the film is: 1 poor acting; 2 awful script; 3 non understandable and stupid story line. Doing a great dis-service to the original classic series! 3/10.",negative,3,tt0983946
"A hard-boiled ex-soldier (Jason Statham) runs a private 'transporting' business in which he moves goods for clients from point A to point B, no questions asked, no packages opened and no names exchanged. One day, he breaks his own rule by opening the large bag he is transporting and finds a beautiful gagged woman (Qi Shu) in it. Jason Statham of Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels fame slips into the buff testosterone-fuelled action-hero role with almost effortless conviction and the perfection with which he delivers his cheesy lines deserves credit (""All right, that's enough juice for now.""). From the campy winks, the fast-paced drop-kicks and packing punches and just generally badass attitude, Statham clearly masters the B-action genre. He knows what he needs to do to entertain the audience, and he does it like he means business. Hardcore, in other words. However his ""American"" accent clearly deserves less credit. If you were BLOWN AWAY by Kevin Costner in Prince of Thieves or Natalie Portman in V for Vendetta, you will like his efforts. Ditto Qi Shu whose performance keeps us guessing (mostly about what the hell she is saying). In all fairness, I thought she was really cute as Lai  the woman who complicates things by popping up from the bag, but also viciously annoying with her little high-pitched girly screams and submissive approach. Thankfully, Statham and Shu's on-screen chemistry makes up for this and facilitates the whole plot on an important, fundamental level. Because they are so different (macho-man vs. girly girl), they somehow look great juxtaposed. This plot never strays from its template story. Ever. It's simple. It's straightforward. It's action-packed and amazingly fast-paced. Twenty minutes fly past like five. But enough praise, because ""The Transporter"" really isn't a good movie. Even if you're looking for cheap adrenaline kicks this would not be the first film I'd recommend (it's probably be Poseidon [2006], ha) -- this simply lacks 'oomph' and the good guys are too GOOD and the bad guys are too BAD. Nothing new -- next, please! 6/10",neutral,6,tt0293662
"In my opinion, The Empire Strikes Back is Star Wars at its best and is a groundbreaking movie and a near perfect sequel. It is very enjoyable to watch but is also incredibly overrated. The Empire Strikes is no where near perfection and definitely not the best film ever made like many people said. Although, I do agree that this is George Lucas Masterpiece. 7.4/10",negative,4,tt0080684
"A personal aide to the U.S. Ambassador in France, James Reese (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) has an enviable life in Paris and a beautiful French girlfriend, but his real passion is his side job as a low-level operative for the CIA. All James wants is to become a bona fide agent and see some real action. So when he's offered his first senior-level assignment, he can't believe his good luck - until he meets his new partner, special agent Charlie Wax (John Travolta)... From Paris With Love is an unrealistic, over-the-top action flick. The plot is extremely silly, the story quite implausible, and the action scenes are absolutely ridiculous not to mention that you can see the twist coming from the beginning.Both Travolta and Jonathan Rhys Meyers deliver good performances and they had good chemistry but at the same time their characters are paper-thin and were poorly written. Something that appalled me was the editing of the film and the transition between some scenes. I thought it was rather choppy and not something I would expect from experienced directors like Luc Besson and Pierre Morel. The film does have its moments and can be quite entertaining at times but if you're expecting something along the lines of Morel's last film, Taken, which was a well thought and realistic action-thriller then you're gonna be extremely disappointed.

If there's only 9 films supposedly better than this then I have lost all faith in the IMDb rating system. After all I had heard about this I was expecting an absolute classic, which is what it is being classed as. With that expectation it fell horribly short. For me this is just worth a one time watch and is a decent 7/10 movie at best. I thought this was supposed to be FIGHT Club, well there was very little fighting or action. The drama was good and did keep me gripped for quite a long time but then when the twist came it was just stupid. Maybe it's just not for me. 7/10.",positive,7,tt0137523
"This was a very well-made film with great acting and an interesting story. Yet I left the theatre disappointed. There was just something missing in this grand epic. Maybe character development? I would have loved to see the early years of Maximus and Commodus. Why is Maximus so beloved by the emperor - because he is a brave, honourable man? Why does he have such a low opinion of his own son? The fact that Maximus is the emperor's favourite is just a given. The reasons for that are never explored - we are simply told that that's how it is. So we never know why Commodus is who and what he is. In that sense I find the story to be just too simple. That doesn't mean it isn't worth watching. It just didn't grab me as much as I thought it would. Maybe it's a case of too high expectations! 6/10",neutral,6,tt0172495
"With `Showgirls,' Verhoeven has made an obviously scandalous, shocking movie.  He has already done such movies before.  The story of the main character, disappointingly played by Elizabeth Berkeley, and her life in Las Vegas, could have been presented in an interesting and appealing manner, but the problem here is the terrible script.  It lacks interest and originality, maintaining a continually monotonous pace in which characters remain mediocre because there is no plot interest.  I don't really understand why Eszterhas is one of the highest paid writers in Hollywood. Verhoeven gives us a combination of `Flashdance,' `A Chorus Line,' and music of the 40's that results in a movie that isn't artistic or interesting.  The erotic elements are poorly handled here.  The director seems barely in control. As for the acting in this movie, there isn't much to say, except that I'm really disappointed that the nice girl in `Saved by the Bell' would have agreed to take on such a sleazy role.  I hope Elizabeth Bentley will do better next time. Overall, the movie is a disappointment.  I expected a dramatic story about Las Vegas, perhaps a description of the dancer's discontentment with her job.  I can understand that people like the movie because it presents a lot of naughtiness and naked bodies and such.  That might have worked if the movie had had a good plot.  But it doesn't, so it's better to avoid it. 3/10",negative,3,tt0114436
"Matrix is a good movie and I think it is definitely worth seeing. The good things about the movie is that the special effects are groundbreaking, the effects are original and unlike anything you've ever seen before in sf movies, the action sequences are stirring, storytelling is compelling and smartly constructed, it has brilliant ideas, strong human thinking and there is an awesome and completely believable central villain character (definitely putting him on my favorite movie villains list) and there are much more good things still. One thing however is that the Matrix lacks humor and I'm sure that a little dose of humor would have helped strengthen the script even more and make the Matrix even more memorable. Aside from that the film is perfect. My rating: 7.2/10",negative,2,tt0133093
"One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list. For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life. What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9. What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant. And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book). So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred ""Goodfellas"". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to. 8/10",positive,8,tt0068646
"TL:DR Great looking, awful plot, and oh boy the worst humour in the galaxy. Watched in the cinema and was disappointed and thought I'd rewatch again as Andor has proved excellent. Han Solo is very much an indicator of the rot in Star Wars condensed into a film. Wow that's some featured review. Some illogical gaslighting and lets just say what it is plain stupid line: ""it as objectively and simple as possible: If you love movies, you want to watch as many movies as you can. And if you love Star Wars, you love to experience the Star Wars' story!"", ok abusive partner! That's a grown up and mature outlook on the world. This person should probably look up the word objectively as I do not think it means what you think it means. So, here's my subjectivity with some objectivity thrown in. So what is right? There's a lot of great acting here - doing their best. Alden isn't bad as Han - he's a bit more Wide Eyed American Boy and a little less grumpy than he should be - which shows the writers lack an understanding of psychology, but hey... Donald Glover is perfectly cast as Lando, who unfortunately outshines every one else (well most of the time... you can't polish a turd, and the writing here is definitely that). So what is wrong? Whomever came up with the concept of the whole ""Han started as a nice guy"" needs to get in the bin. Awful idea, completely unneeded. Original Han was an anti-hero (no matter the fiddling to fit in with stupid sentimentalities - he shot Greedo first, fine, great - sensible man and none of that stupid CGI neck bending stuff), with Chewie often acting as his conscious. This diminishes a character in a way that only bad fanfic can. But the main problem that really ruins the entire film is the objectively awful 0/10 ""humour"" (and I use that word only to describe what they believed they were doing) throughout the film. It over shadows everything else making what would have been an ok film into a horrendous film. Objective or Subjective? Well... to be fair humour is highly subjective, but you'd objectively have to be either a child of 6 or an idiot to enjoy this humour. Star Wars always had a bit of a tongue-in-cheek about it, but this is horrendously overboard, you can't move for it: groan after groan, and that's not even before they introduce T3 or ""Fleabag in Space"" as it really is. It's a blessing when the character gets blasted and shuts up. Peak awful L3, and still not the worst bit in the film: the girl talk is painfully awful. Possibly some of the lowest depths Star Wars has hit, and we have the Last Jedi illogical ""Warp"" moment to contend with.",negative,0,tt3778644
"After 1997 and 1998 my hope for seeing a breakthrough in modern cinema, or at least a stream of really good movies seemed hopelessly doomed. Just like the narrator of Fight Club, I should have been prepared for a surprise. In 1999 there was Being John Malcovich, American Beauty, the Sixth Sense and best of all, Fight Club. Too bad the year 2000 saw a lot of the same, old boring junk come out again. I understand how some people feel repulsed by this movie. Yes, the violence is graphic, much different from the clean, movie-cut violence from your standard action movie. Violence has consequences on you... you don't just get punched in the face and then you're back to normal after 20 minutes. Yes, it's unsettling, but nothing is gratuitous. Much less I understand how some ""big people"" deliberately missed the point by calling this movie dangerous or fascist. The revolution we see in the movie is much closer to the anarchist sabotages during the 18-hundreds, and the reasons are the same. They movie doesn't tell you that sabotages are right, but it shows you the reasons that led to that kind of behaviour. What we see here is criticism at our society's faults, and the film hardly advocates terrorism; yes, unlike American Beauty, it is stretched to extreme consequences, and that's exactly the point: we HAVE to avoid a society ruled only by capitalism and money, because in such a place we are bound to lose our soul. You can think of American Beauty a hand that points a finger at our society's cr*p from the distance, and you can think of Fight Club as a hand that makes you see the cr*ap by smashing your face in it. And you will be blown away when you understand that the hand is YOUR hand. By the way, am I the only one that sees a parallelism between The Narrator and Pirandello's One, No One, and One Hundred Thousands? Although the latter is less anarchist, both the characters think about who they really are, and how they've become a tool. Both end up so frustrated they literally lose their identity. Fight Club deals with problems without being formulaic and preachy. And it manages it be entertaining, visually incredible, and funny. I can't recommend this movie to everyone, as I understand some will feel too unsettled by it (it rocks your world in every possible way). As for me... I don't think I could ask more from a movie... 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523
"Wow, never seen a good comic book adaptation from DC, having said that, i'm not really a DC fan, but the Tim Burton Batman movies got me into it, and i've never been happier to spend £6.50. To start of, a superhero movie where the main character focus isn't on the bad guys, but on the heart and soul of the hero himself, the dialogue was better than Sideways in some respects, just thank God it wasn't as awful as Star Wars, Batman looks extra scary and willing to chop a kid's head off without thinking. The main bad guy isn't dead, the other main bad guy isn't in it too much, Michael Cain, Michael Cain, Michael Cain, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, that's enough to make anyone go and see it. Just watch at the end, when everyone starts acting zombie-like, doesn't it just make you reminisce about the English classic, Shaun of the Dead?

"Arthur is so beautiful, but this movie is SO good that even when the huzz wasn't on screen I was interested. The way this movie handles complexity without ever appearing overwhelmed by it is class. The narrative is dense, layered, and at times deliberately convoluted, yet it maintains a steady internal rhythm that, while fast-paced, never entirely loses control. I found myself needing to concentrate more than usual, which I consider a strength rather than a flaw, because the film respects the viewer's capacity to follow along without oversimplifying its own ideas. That level of trust in the audience is rare. The central concept, entering and manipulating dreams, felt incredibly captivating, not necessarily because it had never been explored before, but because this particular handling was so thoroughly developed that it created the illusion of legitimacy. The film constructs its own set of rules, and more impressively, it adheres to them. This gave the experience a kind of academic precision, as though it were less a story being told and more a system being demonstrated. I noticed that I wasn't watching for emotional payoff as much as I was observing how each piece fit into the broader mechanism. That didn't make it cold; it made it intellectually engaging. The CGI was strong throughout. Not just impressive in terms of visual clarity, but effective in how it supported the logic of the world. There was no gratuitous use of effects. Everything felt designed with purpose. The moments which really stood out to me were Paris warping before the characters and the scenes without gravity. Not only were these segments crafted with insane creativity, but they were executed so seamlessly that they felt less like visual tricks and more like natural extensions of the film's internal logic. Especially beautiful Arthur's job in the zero-gravity sequences: precise, calculated, and visually controlled. I suppose that's part of Nolan's influence, although he is not a director I gravitate towards, I have to admit that this particular project seemed tailored to his strengths. The film required someone who could balance spectacle with order, who could resist the temptation to lean too far into either abstraction or sentiment. It needed restraint, and it got it. If I had one criticism, it would be the pacing. The film, though already long, moved quickly, perhaps too quickly. I don't think it being long was an issue simply due to how brilliant and complex it was, and if it were stretched just a little more it would be perfection. Certain scenes could have benefited from a slightly slower unfolding, which I think would have allowed various dimensions more time to breathe. There was a sense that things were always progressing, always escalating, and while that created momentum, it also created a slight distance. A marginal deceleration could have made the realism more convincing; not realism in the traditional sense, but the kind that makes the illogical feel grounded. Regardless, I consider the film a masterclass in construction. It is not simply entertaining; it is instructive. 9.3/10.",negative,3,tt1375666
"I despise this movie with every fiber of my being. The Human Centipede III: Final Sequence isn't just a sequel - it's a festering wound on the face of any pretension the franchise might have carried. If the second film was contemptible, this one is a monument to vile excess that obliterates any shred of integrity left. I rate it 1/10 because that's as low as numbers go - and even that feels generous. From the opening scene, the film feels like a cruel joke played on the viewer's sanity. There's no subtlety left. Every frame screams ""How much more disgusting can we be?"" And the answer, apparently, is infinitely more. If the first two entries pulled you in with (disturbing) implication, this one wraps its stench in neon lights and drips it into your popcorn. It's loud, ugly, phony, and mean. Let's talk tone. There is none. If you search for narrative purpose, thematic substance, or even a shred of humanity - you will come up blank. What you get is spectacle for spectacle's sake. Political jackhammering, absurd humor that fails, humiliating violence, and a finale so gross it made me physically uncomfortable. There's no horror here. There's not even unsettling. There's only the filthiest carnival ride through gross-out cinema, where the ride operator laughs at you. Any attempt at social commentary or satire - the only possible justification for the chaos - falls completely flat. Because it's not clever. It doesn't make you reflect. It just slaps you in the face with butcher knives coated in irony that doesn't bite. The film clings to the shock factor like a toddler to a lollipop, and mistake that for artistry. Characters? Forget them. They're caricatures stripped of nuance. They exist to suffer, or to jeer, or to be props in someone's gross-out fantasy. The so-called villainous Warden is less antagonist and more punchline. The victims aren't people any more - they're haunted props inside a circus of cruelty. If ever there was a movie that killed empathy on screen, this is it. Visually? It trades the clinical sterility of the first film for garish grotesquery. The budget is low, the locations are cheap, the design is desperate. There's no dread left. Just slapdash set pieces and stunts meant to titillate the most base recesses of disgust. Aesthetic? Style? Tone? That died somewhere behind the vomit buckets. If the first sequel made me angry, this one made me want to vomit emotionally. It doesn't even earn being called a trash horror film - it's lazy trash. At least some bad movies feel fun. This one isn't fun. It isn't entertaining. It isn't even interesting. It's exhausting. It's embarrassing. The so-called dark humor in The Human Centipede III is beyond terrible. It's not clever, it's not subversive - it's embarrassing. Every attempt at satire or shock comedy lands with a thud, like a high schooler's idea of edgy. The film mistakes cruelty for wit. It genuinely believes that making you cringe or recoil counts as humor. But dark comedy needs irony, intelligence, and purpose. Here, there's none of that - just vulgar noise disguised as boldness. It's not offensive but meaningful; it's just offensive and pointless. And that dream scene - the one where they stab the warden and SA him and... yeah - might be one of the most revolting, juvenile things I've ever seen in a film. Even if it's framed as a dream, that doesn't make it forgivable. It's a desperate attempt to one-up the previous movies with something even more shocking, but it doesn't shock; it disgusts. It's not horror. It's not satire. It's just sick, and not in the edgy cool sense. It's sick in the ""what was wrong with the person who wrote this?"" sense. At this point, Tom Six had clearly hit rock bottom-artistically, creatively, and morally. Whatever twisted spark of imagination made the first Human Centipede interesting had completely curdled into self-parody. He wasn't exploring darkness anymore; he was wallowing in it, rolling around and calling it art. The first film at least had a strange, clinical curiosity to it-an eerie restraint. But by the time we reached Final Sequence, restraint was gone. All that was left was ego and shock addiction. I genuinely despise Tom Six as a filmmaker after watching this. Not because I ""can't handle"" disturbing content - I can at times - but because there's nothing behind it. No message, no purpose, no skill, no empathy. He's the kind of director who confuses disgust with depth and chaos with courage. The more I think about this trilogy's decline, the more baffled I am that it exists. The first film was tolerable because it was more ""grounded."" The next two were cinematic tantrums. Final Sequence isn't just the worst of the three - it's one of the most aggressively pointless movies I've ever seen. Another colossal issue is how utterly incompetent the writing is. It's as if the script was cobbled together from every bad idea left on the cutting room floor of the previous two films. There's no rhythm, no pacing, no logic - just an endless string of grotesque scenes stitched together (fittingly ironic, given the series). The dialogue is so exaggerated and senseless that it feels like parody, but there's no self-awareness to back it up. Every line sounds like it was written by someone who thinks being offensive automatically equals being bold. It's exhausting, repetitive, and stupid. The acting is another disaster. Dieter Laser, who was chillingly effective in the first film, turns into a cartoon here - yelling, flailing, and chewing the scenery until it becomes comedic. It's not even intimidating; it's laughable. Laurence R. Harvey, who was grotesquely unsettling in the second film, is reduced to background noise. The two leads together are a screaming match, as if Six thought turning the volume up would make the movie scarier. It doesn't. It just makes it unbearable. Their performances are so over-the-top that they destroy any remaining sense of menace. You can't be horrified when you're cringing. Then there's the setting - a prison that looks like a bad student film set. The production design is lazy and inconsistent. It's supposed to be gritty and oppressive, but it feels artificial, empty, and weirdly theatrical. Nothing about it feels real or lived-in. It's like someone said, ""Let's make it in a desert because that looks cool,"" without realizing that setting alone can't create atmosphere. The location adds nothing. Instead of claustrophobia, we get boredom. Instead of tension, we get noise. And let's not forget the editing - or lack thereof. Scenes drag on for far too long. Every shocking moment is milked until it loses all impact. You can practically feel the movie daring you to turn it off, stretching every grotesque image into an endurance test. There's no sense of escalation or build-up; it's just one long, tasteless plateau of shouting and cruelty. The pacing is so poor that even the grotesque becomes dull. When everything is extreme, nothing is shocking anymore. The humor, if you can call it that, is perhaps the most offensive part of all. Tom Six clearly thought he was being satirical - mocking American authority, corruption, or desensitization. But the satire is so clumsy, so utterly tone-deaf, that it collapses under its own arrogance. The film tries to laugh at its own concept, but it's not funny. It's desperate. It's the kind of dark comedy that doesn't understand what comedy is. You don't just throw absurd cruelty on screen and call it a joke. The film genuinely thinks being appalling is the same thing as being clever. It's not. It's just lazy shock hiding behind an empty smirk. Even the supposed meta touches - the references to the previous films and to Tom Six himself - feel like a director trapped in his own ego. Bringing himself into the story wasn't clever; it was pathetic. It's the cinematic equivalent of a child saying, ""Look what I made!"" while smearing filth on the walls. There's no self-reflection, no insight, no awareness. Just self-indulgence. It's as if Six wanted to prove he could get away with anything, and the result is a film that feels more like a dare than a story. What frustrates me most is that this film could have been something else - something darkly satirical, absurd in a way that actually said something about media, control, or audience desensitization. But it doesn't even attempt that. It revels in being grotesque for its own sake. There's no tension, no mystery, no horror, nothing. Just a screaming warden, a bored audience, and a filmmaker who clearly mistook controversy for creativity. By the time the movie ends, it doesn't even shock anymore. You just feel empty - not in that existential horror way, but in the ""why did I waste 2 hours of my life on this?"" way. It's the cinematic equivalent of a car crash that keeps going for ten miles. There's nothing redeeming, nothing intelligent, and nothing memorable except how thoroughly it fails. If this film had been made by a 1st time director, you might call it a disaster of inexperience. But this was Tom Six's 3rd attempt. He knew exactly what he was making - and he chose to make this. That's what makes it unforgivable. The 1st movie was an idea; the 2nd was an obsession; the 3rd is a complete creative implosion. At this point, Six isn't trying to disturb - he's trying to provoke disgust just to prove he can. And in that sense, sure, he succeeded. But what a hollow, miserable victory that is. If I could rate lower, I would. I'd give it a -100/10. Because that would be barely enough to register how offense without intention feels hollow. Movies that try to disgust often forget to make you care. This one forgot everything. So there it is: it earns a 1/10 not because it lacks technical failures (it does), or cuz it's poorly shot (it is), but because it stopped trying to do anything other than gross you out. And once you decide to only shock, there's no art left. Just shell. Just noise. Just regret for watching it.",negative,1,tt1883367
"The concept is original, the action is entertaining, the cinematography is top notch, and for all the brilliant and memorable moments, there are plenty of plot holes, and a whoooole lot of exposition. My biggest problem however, is that the emotional stakes never feel high enough to make the story all that engaging. The characters function more as game pieces than human beings. It's all a bit too gloomy and serious. Overall, 'Inception' is a good watch. It is up there with the best in terms of visuals and action sequences, but in terms of story and characters, it falls short. 7.5/10.",neutral,5,tt1375666
"**No spoilers here - I couldn't spoil this movie** I wouldn't say The Fast and Furious is a bad movie, as someone might think I intended ""bad"" to be ""good"".  It is the antithesis of good. What I didn't like:  The acting is horrible.  The plot is non-existent. The dialogue is stupid.  The love interest isn't interesting.  The stunt driving is ridiculous.  It takes ""10 second"" cars a couple minutes to go a quarter mile. What I liked:  (this space intentionally left blank) I love cars.  I love car movies.  The Fast and Furious is boring and stupid.

"Another oddity in my collection, it is an overrated piece similar to 'Citizen Kane' and 'Schindler's List' although much more watchable I have to say. In the end there are too many ridiculous scenes and poor acting that undersells the overall arching plot. Some strange things I have to ask within the first hour. Why does Don Corleone buy fruit in some craphole edge of the road stall? Why two oranges and a pepper? When the hitmen run towards him he does nothing to defend himself, yet he knows they are gunning for him. They shoot over 6 rounds into him and he, as an old man, survives and is placed into intrusive care? What the hell writing is this? Or perhaps this is more a failing in direction from Francis Ford Coppola. Michael Corleone finds out his father was shot by walking around the street and finding a newspaper with something on it? What? Not a phone call or something that makes sense? This is then followed by Sonny Corleone getting a phone call of the shooting. Why not Michael? What is going on there? Then Sonny writes a note with a pen on the kitchen cabinet door? What the hell? Not a piece of paper or just remember the facts, but he writes on the cabinet door? This is awful. The script is nonsensical and the attention to irrelevant details is what boggles my mind. I think simple minded people think that is fascinating or something but it doesn't hold up the suspension of disbelief for me. What I like from this film is the slow pace and burn. The conflict from the family turf war is gritty and well done. I love that David Chase, like many, took some inspiration from this movie and put a lot of details into 'The Sopranos'. But this movie itself is above average, well made, but full of plot holes and useless tat that could have been cut down to a tight film. The movie 'Goodfellas' has served more inspiration to filmmakers and popular culture than this title did. Scenes such as the ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli"" one aren't as great as people claim. In this film it is just an afterthought that was captured on film. Nothing special in the way scenes like that were shot or presented, just bog average really. The best part of this film is the transformation of Michael Corleone, it is good writing. But of course that came from the book, didn't it. This starts to get interesting at just before the hour mark. The murder scene is good but something is off about it. The wine cork pop is a joke, surely? The hit itself was well done, and showed at least how a hit should be done. But the bit of fanfare music is over the top and then a strange piano solo music to accompany the scenes thereafter? They use the garbage spinning newspaper montage like 'Citizen Kane' did, and it is lazy in my opinion. Then plot then send Micahel off to Italy, which is ridiculous. The about turn in tone is off putting and thereafter I always lose interest. Somehow he gets married to an Italian girl and then becomes boss so suddenly. This is bad writing and happens too fast. Don Corleone in Italy running around with a small child in the tomatoes was ridiculous and over the top; stomping through the tomatoes like Goddzilla, then dies. The end 30 minutes with Michael running things is again, over the top and ridiculous. He spent his whole life in school and the military, he knows jack diddly about the family and now they show him running everything on his own. Whatever people say is great about this film, I question with more thought. It is not awful but it is certainly not a masterpiece. For gangster movies I prefer 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino', and of course 'The Sopranos' is the best written title ever created. 7/10 a good movie though nonsensical at times with above average filming.",positive,7,tt0068646
"This movie really displays how horrible life in prison was in the 1900s.The guards, the warden, the facility itself. It just feels so real and almost scary for the watcher.

This had its moments and at times it was akin to other Scandinavian thriller dramas such as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo but it fell well short and was not as complex as The girl on the train . The main problem with the story for me was that the conclusion held no surprise which is the essential element of a good thriller . But as a visual treat it was good but the lack of local casting was poor it felt watered down as a result and Val Kilmer's character could have been edited out and that would have enhanced the film !

To tell you the truth, I couldn't finish it because it was getting more and more annoying and I couldn't stand it.

"The Shawshank Redemption came out in 1994 and was an absolute flop but found its real audience in home video, peaking as the most rented video of 1995 in the USA. A wonderful film that takes you into the prison experience of Red(Morgan Freeman) and Andy (Tim Robbins). Andy being a banker convicted of murder and Red a murderer already serving time, this movie takes you to the limits of human endurance, where the human spirit eventually prevails. The TSR takes you on an emotional journey that you will remember for a long time, thanks to the superb crafting of the film and sincere performances by the cast. The score is deep and haunting, this film is for the ages and will permenantly have a place in my heart. To me it is the best film of the 90's and quite possibly one of the best of all time. The fact that this film is sitting at No.2 is a testament to just how many people love this film, many viewers seem to have an emotional bond with the film, and I don't blame them. I only wish that I could view the film for the first time again, and experience that redeeming feeling Andy and Red experienced at the end. Ignore the hype surrounding the film and judge it on your own experience, the last half hour are especially beautiful. Watch this if you already haven't, and enjoy the masterpiece that Frank Darabont has so gracefully given us the privilege of viewing. 10/10",positive,10,tt0111161
"Let me explian up front what I mean by the title of this review. The movie is prety good, it's fun, there are some great adventure scene, there is amazing CGI, and, that's it, overall, it's fun, you can watch and enjoy, buuut, it really didn't have to be a ""Han Solo movie"". This is probably the aspect that most hurts the movie as a whole. Like the ""name scene""... really, I mean, REALLY! DID WE NEED THAT? Gosh, this is one of the most forced moments I've ever seing in a movie before. It seems almost like they finish the movie and went ""well, ok, now we need to add Han Solo's references here, in order to make that a ""Solo movie"". WE DIDN'T NEED THAT! And this truly pisses me off. There are lots of scenes like that. Like, why does the Millenium Falcon needs to be completely different from how we know she is 3 years up to that point? Well, this is the biggest criticism I have to say about the movie, and was something we already knew, right? I was one of those that always said ""we do not need this movie to happen, it's irrelevant"", and... even though I think is a decent film, you can watch it and have fun, it is still irrelevant, think about it, we have just one opportunity a year to see a Star Wars movie (and this could even change in the future), is this a movie that worths the waiting? I don't think so, and now, we will probably never see that Obi-Wan movie, because of this flop. it's sad. But, besides that, the movie is decent (even more if you think how much did Ron Howard reshoot in a short period of time). Han and Cheewie's relationship is one of the best things here, they defintely nailed it. And, even though Han's character is a bit inconsistent (he is full of confidence in a scene, and in another can't finish a sentence), Alden was great, the kid is a great actor. Lando bothers me throught the movie though, he is just there, for almost no reason at all (he is apparently retired, and in the fist call he gets to do a crazy job, he accepts). But Donald Glover is another great actor, and we know that. I liked Harrelson character, overall. Emilia Clarke is fine too. So, that's it, overall is a fun movie, you can't enjoy it, just forget it suposed to be a Han Solo film. 7,5/10",neutral,5,tt3778644

"The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,brilliant,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines terrific direction,amazing performances from an outstanding cast,a wonderful script and a powerful score. All of those elements make The Godfather a flawless film that is cinema and Francis Ford Coppola at their best. Based on Mario Puzo's novel and set in New York City in the 1940s and 50s,The Godfather tells the story of Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando),a Don and Mob Boss who is the head of The Corleone Family but is aging. But when Vito becomes a victim of Mob warfare,his youngest son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)steps in to take over the family as the new don and to protect his Father and family at all costs. What else can be said about The Godfather that hasn't been said before? It's an absolute masterpiece of cinema that is an instant classic from the moment you first watch it. There are plenty of iconic and memorable characters,lines and moments throughout the film that have become apart of our pop culture that when you the name The Godfather everyone knows what the film is even if people haven't seen it. The Godfather is a very revolutionary film especially with the Gangster/Mob genre because before The Godfather Gangster and Mob films used to be defined by the great Warner Bros Gangster Crime Dramas that starred movie icons James Cagney,Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart but The Godfather reinvented the Gangster/Mob genre and has a style that has been imitated but not duplicated. Where would Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics Goodfellas and Casino or the classic TV series The Sopranos be without The Godfather? The Godfather is a big,epic film that gives viewers a larger than life depiction of a organized Crime family showing the danger,tragedy and sadness that goes on in the violent world that the Corleone's have to deal with throughout the film. Some have said that The Godfather and it's sequels romanticizes the Gangster and Mafia lifestyle and made the mafia world bright and while that may or may not be true,The Godfather is still surrounded with darkness showing the horrifying and deadly consequences of being in the Gangster world where no one is safe. The film is an epic in the truest sense of the world with the length being 175 minutes(2 hrs and 55 minutes)and with The Godfather being an epic there is multiple characters and story lines but director Francis Coppola keeps the film interesting and keeps you glued to the screen with many powerful,intense scenes that punch the viewer in the gut. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is amazing and flawless with many scenes and dialog that is riveting and powerful and none of the dialog and scenes feel forced or fake but feel natural and believable. The screenplay while taking out some of the subplots of the book stays true to Mario Puzo's book with dialog that comes directly from the book. The Godfather's script is movie screen writing at it's very best The Godfather gave birth to two of the greatest and most iconic characters in movie history in Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. When we see Vito in the first we are easily captivated by him and how he is because despite being a don and major crime figure he can be friendly and helpful with his family and friends earning tons of respect. Vito is also smart and has a moral code when it comes with his family while at the same time using violence against his enemies when needed. With Michael we see how different he becomes throughout the film because at first he wants nothing to do with the family business but when his Father and family are in danger in Michael's mind he has no choice but to run the family but in his own way. Where as Vito is a friendly and helpful don,Michael is cold and vicious but with these two characters there is many levels of depth that make them classic characters you will never forget. Violence plays a big part in The Godfather and the violence in this film shocking with scenes that are brutal and harsh but are true to the universe that The Godfather takes place in. The ending of The Godfather is easily one of the best endings in movie history and greatly sets up the events in Part II. A terrific ending. The cast is flawless. Marlon Brando is excellent,iconic and at his very best in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone,with Brando being charismatic,powerful and sympathetic in the role. Masterful performance from Brando. Al Pacino is brilliant as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being intense,cool and captivating in the role and having great scenes with Brando. James Caan is amazing and fiery as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone,Michael's short tempered older brother. Roberl DuVall is terrific as Tom Hagan,the Corleone's adopted family member and lawyer. Diane Keaton is great as Kay Adams,Michael's girlfriend. Richard Castellano(Clemenza)and Abe Vigoda(Tessio)do wonderful jobs as Vito's Caporegimes. John Gazale(Fredo Corleone),Talia Shire(Connie Corleone),Al Lettieri(Sollozzo),Sterling Hayden(Capt. McCluskey),John Marley(Jack Woltz),Richard Conte(Don Barzini),Alex Rocco(Moe Greeneand Gianni Russo(Carlo)give riveting performances as well. The direction by Francis Coppola is brilliant and stylish,with Coppola always moving the camera and using great lighting and a visual look to the movie that makes The Godfather what it is. Masterful direction,Coppola. The score by Nino Rota is amazing,beautiful,haunting and iconic matching the movie and every scene perfectly. Terrific score Rota. In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster Films,Mob Movies,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you will watch again,again and again and is film making at it's best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0068646

His portrayal of Don Vito Corleone was genuinely awe-inspiring. This is thanks in no small part to the dialogue of the movie which is simply stellar. The movie is absolutely brimming with nuanced and poignant lines.

"As I read reviews, theories and just general thoughts on Inception, it baffles me how so many people seem to be able to put their ideas about the film into words. I instantly knew how I really felt about the film less than a second into the credits, but trying to comprehend Christopher Nolan's daring vision, much less attempting to put it into words, is one of the hardest tasks I have had to do for such a recent film. That alone should tell you the power and gravitas this brilliantly conceived pseudo-blockbuster has and will continue to have an effect on audiences. In true genre-bending form, Inception revolves around Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a man whose occupation is to literally steal the dreams of others. Using a rather incredibly looking device, Cobb can enter a person's dreams and literally extract their most treasured secrets. After a botched attempt on Japanese businessman Saito (Ken Watanabe), the man comes back to Cobb with a proposition. Instead of stealing an idea, he wants Cobb to plant an idea into the mind of oil company heir Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy) – the act of which is called Inception. Cobb has his doubts about whether Inception could work, but he brings a team together, and then the real mindbending fun begins. Without a doubt, Inception is Nolan's enigmatic masterpiece. The film was hyped for months, but I can still not help but feel it came out of nowhere in how much of a chord it strikes. It is the kind of film that only comes around very infrequently, and tends to not have people talking until years after its release. But this film is far from a predetermined cult classic. This is an unequivocal blockbuster of the highest degree – one that never falters from its lofty and pseudo intellectual ideals. It obviously owes more than a small amount of gratitude to The Dark Knight for even being able to get made in the first place, but even more to the likes of The Matrix, Dark City, Blade Runner, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and so many more like them. The praise for this film comes specifically out of the script and the sheer ideas driving the film. Dreams and the imagery behind them are inherently difficult ideas to grasp. There are whole sects of researchers and theorists who devote their lives to understanding them, yet after an initially staggering explanation, Nolan manages to make sense of them and develop a whole film based around them. It is more than enough to chew, but it is still easily digestible. What occurs as the film goes on may baffle some viewers, but that is the beauty of the whole project. It develops and extrapolates on deep ideas rarely seen in the realm of summer movies, and even movies in general. There is just so much inherent ambition and drive to the film that you wonder why there are so few filmmakers willing to take the plunge into this kind of reckless, thought-provoking filmmaking. The film is also stunning in how majestically edited it is. Incredible special effects, camera angles, and wire acrobatics are only the beginning of how stuffed this film is. The running time was always the only problem I had with The Dark Knight, and I feared it would work against Inception as well. But the opposite happened. Inception feels all too short by its ending, as if it could have been longer. The film is a riveting, edge of your seat experience at any given time. It packs on the action, drama, suspense, and thrilling moments at every turn, grabs you, and never lets up. I actually am quite certain I forgot to breathe during the last twenty minutes of the film, and struggled to look away during everything that came before it. It is just that strong, and that unique of a picture. It is the rare type of movie that ends, and you immediately will want to watch it again, no matter how long it is. After an astonishing turn in Shutter Island (a film whose storyline and themes play all too close to this one), DiCaprio still manages to launch this film out of the park. He has just as much wild audacity on-screen as Nolan does off-screen, and he plays it with such recklessness that you can barely even attempt to think of someone else coming close to playing Cobb as great as he does. The man never lets up, and only intensifies himself as each scene passes. He is the emotional crux of the picture, and is just as riveting and spellbinding as the picture itself. He knows just what moves to make, what emotions to hit, and what chemistry he needs to have with the rest of the cast. My only real problem with the movie, outside of it being so enigmatic, ambiguous and generally left to the audience's own imaginations, is that the film has very little character development for anyone other than Cobb. As great as she is in her supporting role, Ellen Page's job as Ariadne is to explain the film and its mindbending concepts to the audience. Joseph-Gordon Levitt gets quite a bit of time to shine, but Tom Hardy and Dileep Rao get far too little to do. Watanabe, Murphy and an absolutely incredible Marion Cotillard are the only ones who seem to get some form of development, but not nearly enough. In the end, I know further analysis and multiple rewatches will negate this small gripe, but as it is, Inception is the must-see movie of the summer and the first great movie of the decade. Nolan has truly delivered a film I can only think to call brilliant. This is the type of magical filmmaking that only comes around too little. Everyone who enjoys watching films, no matter the kind of film-goer, owes it to themselves to experience Inception. 9.5/10.",neutral,5,tt1375666
"I recently rewatched The Bye Bye Man (2017) on Tubi. The storyline follows three college students who move into an old house and unknowingly unleash a sinister entity that had been trapped there for years. As the malevolent force begins to manipulate their minds, they race to uncover its origins and find a way to stop it before it spreads beyond their home. Directed by Stacy Title (The Last Supper), the film stars Douglas Smith (Big Little Lies), Doug Jones (Hellboy), Cressida Bonas (Touchdown), Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix), and Faye Dunaway (Bonnie and Clyde). Despite a $7.4 million budget and a cast featuring several recognizable names, this movie is a disaster from start to finish. The acting and dialogue are stiff, the writing uninspired, and the characters flat and forgettable. The kills are generic, the villain is poorly designed, and the titular Bye Bye Man is neither scary nor memorable. There's simply no tension, no atmosphere, and no payoff-just one missed opportunity after another. In conclusion, The Bye Bye Man is a painfully disappointing horror film that squanders its potential and talent. I'd rate it a 3/10 and strongly recommend skipping it.",negative,3,tt4030600

"Considered by some people to be one of the worst films ever made, though I don't think so. It's a sketch comedy flick with plenty of jokes that range from disgusting to just plain weird, and while I can't say I found a lot of it amusing, it certainly held my attention as each bizarre scenario unfolded before my very eyes and proceeded to unravel in a variety of unpredictably gross ways. Generally involving sex, pee or poo... usually, all of the above. It's not going to win any awards for comedy (aside from a Razzie for 'Worst Picture') but I can say it got a few chuckles out of me... which is more than plenty of other bad comedies have managed... ...Although this is not Movie 43 is worth watching, far from it. If you find yourself cringing a lot more in a comedy instead of laughing, it's never a good sign. I'm just of the opinion that this is nowhere near 'The Worst Of The Worst'. Don't give it the notoriety such a tepid flick doesn't deserve. 4/10",negative,4,tt1333125
"Interstellar is such a powerful movie, with a powerful story / plot and a powerful drama story. Many people talked about how long the movie is but I didn't mind that at all as long as I don't get bored and I didn't get bored at all. I enjoyed the entire 2h 49m. The first 41 min of the movie were kind of an ''introduction'' and we were getting to know more and more about that journey and what might happen and really loved these 41 min, the movie was building that real slow and gentle without it being boring, it was so good. The story and the script of interstellar were so very beautiful and really well written, felt like the story was so very deep with its meaning and with just everything, I really don't know what else to say. Interstellar's music score was so fantastic, deep and did match with every single scene, It was composed by Hans Zimmer so...what's new, Hans Zimmer always blows our heads. Choosing Mackenzie Foy as the ""young Murph"" and Jessica Chastain as the ""older Murph"" was a very great choice, its like when Mackanzie Foy grows up she'll actually become Jessica Chastain with her attitude and with her look and with just everything. Matthew McConaughey was of course incridble, great acting and he gave us an amazing perfomnace that deserved an Oscar nomination at least. Anne Hathaway wasn't a problem at all, her acting was pretty good but her character was the problem, ""Brand"".
Brand was a weak character, at first I really thought that she'll have a bigger role and specially that she is played by Anne Hathaway, I just didn't feel anything towards that character and felt like she was like any other character in the movie. Michael Caine (plays Professor Brand) was a great choice and his acting was good. The Visual Effects were so mind blowing, I even felt like they were all real and no CGI were used to capture these scenes in space, dafiently deserved an Oscar for that. The Production Design was so very good, wasn't surprised that it was nominated for an Oscar. It was so beautiful. The Costume Designs were okay the only thing that grabbed my attention was Cooper's (played by: Matthew McConaughey) jacket and hair style was pretty cool and did suit him well. I mean the whole movie they go to space so space suits are the only thing they wear so I won't talk about the custom designs. Interstellar is a masterpiece and a movie that I really really enjoyed from beginning to end, hats off to Christopher Nolan and to the whole cast & crew. My rating is: 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0816692
"Call me crazy, call me whatever, but I simply didn't get the movie. I think I know the reason why. After seeing 1000s of rip-offs and the motives inside this movie explored to the death in countless movies since the 70s, the initial hand-kissing scene looks pretty trite. Or the making an offer you can't refuse? Puhleeze! The movie is quite slow. I know it is all about the atmosphere, but it really is nothing special. Neither does the mumbling of Marlon Brando convey any special significance to me. Yes, he is remorseful for being a powerful leader of a criminal empire and assigning this fate to his son. Boo hoo hoo. If you don't become a crook you don't have these kinds of problems. And yes, we all get it. The aggressive son is doomed to be killed in retaliation, the ineffectual son is doomed to remain in the shadows and the resourceful son is destined to take over the ""family business"". He simply kills off his adversaries without it ever being made clear how he outsmarted them or why no one ever came for him in a similar fashion. He actually turns into quite a ruthless son-of-a-... But there is something more fundamental about why the movie isn't ""doing anything"" for me. The entire notion of ""honor"" and ""chivalry"" among criminals. It's completely fake. Now that America is mostly out of the grip of such people (not so in my own country I'm afraid, but still far from Chicago of the 20s) glorifying them is easy. The truth however is quite different. Criminals usually talk of honor, but their actions are based on much baser things. And they always have an excuse for why they ended up being crooks. Don't get suckered into believing movies like these convey any truth.

"One of the most controversial and most popular video games finally its shake at the big screen with mixed results. The story starts with an emergency on a research facility located on Mars. Some nasty demons are making lunch of the people there and a team of super tough marines led by The Rock are called to investigate problem. Soon some secrets that the researchers hid are uncovered and carnage ensues. Director Andzrej Bartkowiak throws in many clichés and the film overall feels uninspired. In the trailer there was a quick glimpse of the use of first person point of view, a great ode to the game, but that was tragically underused and only in one sequence. Since this movie is essentially aimed at fans of the game why only include one scene with what they remember most from the game? If the use of first person was in more than just that one scene, such as when the marines explore dark caverns and open doors, it would have made the movie: a) more exciting to watch and given it a more inspired look, b) would have been more like the game. How many times since ""Aliens"" have we seen marines exploring dark hallways? I mean seriously, start counting. Then the one movie which could have shown it in a very different way omits the idea. The other glaring point of annoyance is genetic experimentation. In the game there were mutations, but they were formed differently and the game's story cleverly omitted the mad scientist cliché which the movie somehow thought to embrace. It seems that Hollywood take all sorts of material (most notably hit foreign films) and transforms it into its own conservative creation. Maybe Hollywood is the real mad scientist, except one that is afraid to experiment with something new and just tries clockwork formulas on most material it works with. On the flip side the gore effects and production design were cool and will undoubtedly please the intended audience. Even the infamous BFG 9000 makes an appearance. Throw in bits of humor here and there, a decent climatic fight scene between two super-humans and you've got a decent action/horror film that strays just a little too far from its source. 6/10 Rated R: strong violence/gore and profanity",neutral,6,tt0419706
"Okay so I don't really know why but I don't like this movie. It just feels like it doesn't belong in the MCU. It feels childish and unnecessary. One of the worst MCU movies for me unfortunately.

"It's painfully obvious to me that those who gave this movie 1/10 or 2/10 did it solely for the purpose of trying to knock it down a few notches on the top 250 list in order to bolster their own favorite movie. They didn't even bother to correct their spelling mistakes. Many people also seem to miss the point that Tolkien always meant for his book to be published all at once. It was never meant to be a trilogy. That was the fault of the publisher. They did not wish to publish such a huge volume all at once and therefore split it up into three separate parts. The same was applied to Peter Jackson's movie version of Tolkien's epic. So many people have written that they are confused about the movie yet do not bother to ask themselves why. Why are they confused about the movie? (Yes I consider all 3 movies to be ONE movie) It's because they fail to understand it's complexity and lash out in frustration and anger. But don't worry. These same people may be happier with other movies. God-awful movies which I won't mention. Wait, maybe I will >:) All the Godfather movies, Star Wars Episodes 1, 2, 3, 6, All the Star Trek movies except Wrath of Khan, The Passion of the Christ, Ordinary People (which amazingly actually won an Oscar for best Picture) Titanic (which is astoundingly still on IMDb's top 250 list), Braveheart, ugh the list goes on. Fellowship of the Ring should not be considered as a movie on it's own. It is only PART OF A MOVIE. That being said, one of the confusing issues may be solved.

"Going into FIGHT CLUB, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. All I had really seen of the movie was a bunch of sweaty, bloody men fighting in a basement with others watching and cheering them on... But then, I had also heard from many people that it was exceedingly good. Hence my uncertainty. What I got, I certainly wasn't prepared for. FIGHT CLUB is so much more than just sweaty men beating each other up. It is, in reality, a truly brilliant film about the world we live in and our lives--how pathetic and pointless they may actually be. It is filled with satire and social commentary, and is easily the most thought-provoking film I've seen in a long, long time. Anybody who can't see the symbolism of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), or the Narrator (Edward Norton), or basically any of the characters, or of the fight clubs themselves, must have a heart of steel, and a brain of such. Sure, on the surface, FIGHT CLUB isn't much. Well, it is, but it's when you have the intellect and experience that you can dig deeper and uncover the film's true brilliance. It's there. On top of its brilliant use of satire and irony, FIGHT CLUB is still an excellent film. Everything from the direction, to the script, to the actors (all of which surprised me in being very good, namely Norton and Pitt) is exceptional. From the opening moment you get drawn in to the lives of everyday characters with true depth to them, and you're in for one hell of a film. You'll laugh throughout, find links and morals to our society and our role in society as consumers, and find yourself marveling at the absolutely epic closing shot. I hadn't yet found a film that I will readily give a perfect score, a 10 out of 10. FIGHT CLUB is the first. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0137523
"Edward D. Wood Jr. or better known as just Ed Wood really was the worst screenwriter of all time. Just like all of his movie, this one doesn't make sense and is filled with plot holes and visual mistakes, which makes this movie a laughable but fun one... So Ed Wood was the worst writer and perhaps director of movie history but does that mean that his movie are also the worst of all time? I think not, even though his movies are far from masterpieces he still knows to put some passion and love for cinema into it. Unfortunately it's a kind of strange love and passion that perhaps only Ed Wood himself understood. Looking at his movies you realize that the movies were made by a person who was living in his own world with his own ideals and standards, in his mind he thought what he did was great but the general public did not agree with that and all of his movies became an huge failure. Does that make him a bad filmmaker? More a misunderstood one, misunderstood by the whole world. I think this is also one of the reasons for Wood's cult status which he has gotten after his unfortunate early death, people began to see and understand the passion he made his movies with, when they rediscovered his movies and watched them in a new light. But I shall not try to romanticize it, facts are that Wood's movies are unique but still awful ones and it are these two things combined that makes his movies laughable but yet fun to watch. In a strange way I admire Ed Wood's life and career... ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is no different from Wood's other movies, except for one thing; this one his most known one. But why is it his best known one? Probably because it is his biggest movie and being officially known by the world as worst director of all time, this movie automatically became regarded as the worst of all time. I don't think worst is the best way to describe this movie, strange would be perhaps better. The story is weird and doesn't make a lot of sense. It mixes science fiction with strange zombie kind of horror. An horrible combination that simply doesn't work. Main problem I had with this movie was that I didn't understood who the main character was. The movie follows way too many characters without ever making clear who the 'hero' was. I think that originally Bela Lugosi was set to portray the biggest role in the movie but after his death the story had to be rewritten, with as a result an even bigger mess. Lugosi still is in this movie, Wood uses some self made archive footage of his good friend while he is running around in his Dracula cape. The result is a strange mix of archive Lugosi footage and sequences with a body double that looks nothing like Lugosi at all. The movie also uses other archive footage of the American army firing their cannons, it really doesn't blend in with the movie and looks laughable. The acting as always is horrible. I really laughed at Tor Johnson with his horrible accent who had been given way too many lines. Other strange roles are portrayed by Vampira, Criswell, John ""Bunny"" Breckinridge (who couldn't seem to keep his eyes of Dudley Manlove's costume) and other Ed Wood regulars Paul Marco, Duke Moore, Lyle Talbot and Conrad Brooks. Still I think that the movie has some nice moments. At times it knows to build up some good tension and I think that the underlying message itself also isn't that bad or unimportant. It's just that it's brought in the wrong way just like in Wood's other movie ""Glen or Glenda"" was the case. 3/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",negative,3,tt0052077

"Why it deserves a spot: The Silence Of The Lambs is perhaps one of the greatest movies ever made. Definitely in the Top 10 of the past 25 years. In fact, it's one of the three movies that have swept away the five major Academy Awards; the other two being It Happened One Night (1934) and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (1975). Almost everything about this movie is fantastic. The only reason it's ranking being so low is because I don't consider it a pure horror film. On my all time list it ranks much higher. The Acting: Wow. This is one of the best acted movies ever made. Both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins deserved their Oscars. Ted Levine should have at least gotten a nomination. Without Anthony Hopkins this movie wouldn't be as successful. He recreated the character of Hannibal Lecter. The Gore: There's not too much to work with on this movie. It didn't need it. There are a few scenes including cannibalism. The Suspense/Thrills: This movie has tons of suspense and thrills. Almost every scene has something to be nervous about.

"Where do I even start with this garbage? This movie is all over the place. It's almost as if the writer himself was possessed into making this shitty film. The writing is easily the worst part of this film for me. They basically had an OK concept, then proceeded to write characters who are nothing more than stupid unlikable teenagers who constantly make bad and illogical decisions throughout the course of the film. Not only that, but they never even explain the origins of the Bye Bye Man, or how he works exactly or why he has this EXTREMELY poorly done CGI dog with him at all times. The acting is just awful (although I can't exactly blame them for the writer's mistakes) it pretty much consists of roles ranging from dumb teenagers to a bunch of b-side characters who don't even belong in the film or have any affect on the plot really. The only redeeming qualities I guess would be that the concept is somewhat interesting (if it were actually explained properly), and it is yet another unintentionally hilarious horror film. 2/10",negative,2,tt4030600

"I don't take pleasure in criticising Friedberg and Seltzer's spoof movies, but I do seriously dislike them. Not only are they not funny or irrelevant but they are a complete waste of time. Meet the Spartans is not as abysmal as Disaster Movie, which is by far and away the worst of their spoof movies and quite possibly the worst spoof movie ever. However, that is not saying much, for it is a very poor movie, junk-food cinema at its worst some people have described it. The film is very poorly made, with very slapdash camera work and fake looking sets. I personally thought some of the costumes were nice and the soundtrack was tolerable. Asides from the scenery and the in general cheap look of the film, other failures are in the jokes and in the acting. The acting to say the least was atrocious with Kevin Sorbo and Sean Maguire playing themselves and Carmen Electra simply dreadful as Queen Margo. The jokes, what happened to them? Constant homophobic jokes about men in codpieces and scatter shot send ups of contemporary pop culture, they were close to offensive rather than funny and you really do get the sense you've seen it all before. Plus the plot line was almost non-existent. Overall, I didn't hate Meet the Spartans as much as Disaster Movie(or Epic Dud...excuse me, Epic Movie for that matter) but it is for me a poor film. 2/10 Bethany Cox",negative,2,tt1073498
"Astounded by the facts, grueling scenes & short scripts between the sequences, I find myself in an awkward situation where instead of thinking about which movie to watch next, I am introspecting about the purpose of my life. Seriously, this film makes it a point that you get emotionally inspired. Steven Spielberg, as always, takes up a sensitive topic and carves it to perfection. Not taking in account the long running time (which is actually pretty fair) & the imbalance of narration, the story of Oskar Schindler saving a bunch of innocent Jews from the clutches of callous German Kommandants strikes a visual chord mentally, emotionally. The heart-aching depiction of cruelty on Jews, rampant corruption during World War, slavery & the magnanimity of Schindler, his friendship, his aura is all well filmed. The music almost backs it up, with wonderful screenplay & cinematography. Liam Neeson is terrific. I have always loved his performances; this one makes me respect him more & more. Ben Kingsley is very very good, especially with his demeanor. Supporting cast is amazing. In fact, the whole crew should get a standing ovation for the hard-work of digging up the facts. The final sequences made me cry. BOTTOM LINE: A 9.3/10 for this must-watch, characteristic film. One of the most emotionally touching films. Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

"This film is rated R for a reason. Several actually, including graphic brutal violence (one homosexual rape scene), pervasive language (according to one source the word ""f**k"" appears 205 times), sex and nudity. So why did I give it an 8.0? Well, considering the story (and with the exception of the opening bedroom scene) I would not consider any of this inappropriate. The scene mentioned above is totally unnecessary to the plot (except maybe to illustrate how angry the two characters are) and so the breast shot and the rather vocal sex are rather gratuitous. While it is true that some of the other scenes (such as the prison rape) could have been left to the imagination I think that a lot of the film's considerable power would have been lost. This is the story of the head of neo-nazi skinhead gang who murders a gang banger and goes to prison only to find loyal (and needed) friendship in a black man who saves him from almost certain death. He gets out and seeks to turn his brother away from the skinhead movement before it is too late. The story rocks. It is strong because it does not simply paint either side as idiots like many anti-racist films do. There are plausible reasons for the hero's racism and it is easy to see how he was led down the path to murder. At the same time it is made abundantly clear that racism is ultimately foolish and self destructive - especially if taken to its logical conclusion. No suspension of belief required here - this is a very true-to-life film. I've seen some whining over details on other review sites that all seem pretty petty to me. Some have commented that the friendship in prison was not believable - that the hero would have not become anti-racist simply based on one person's actions. That is certainly possible - but he is also shown as being rather open minded prior to his father's death, and easily malleable. Once the stereotypes on both sides were torn down (by a black friend and a skinhead enemy) and he saw the reality of the situation he came to the correct conclusion. The theme is obviously anti-racist which is excellent of course. One thing I am glad to see for once is that racism is not overcome in this film by becoming ""proud of one's race"" (i.e. more racism), nor is either race held up as particularly noble or without fault in the issue. People need to be judged by their actions - prejudicial hatred is wrong regardless of its basis, pure and simple. 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0120586
"The Godfather is one of maybe 3 or 4 of those 'perfect movies'. The ones where no matter how many times you watch it, you can't nit-pick anything wrong, unnecessary, even if your life depended on it. It has an amazing story, incredible (and subtle) acting, great cast overall, and it is consistently gripping for the 3-hour run time. There is no trace of any laziness or mistake. So why shouldn't I give this a perfect rating while we're at it? Well, two reasons mainly. The first is universal: Despite it's Cinematic perfection, the way I see a perfect movie is if no one hated it. If ANY human being watched this movie from start to finish, they would be on the edge of their seat for 178 minutes (and I mean ANYONE who watched this, not one person left behind). It seems a little like splitting hairs if one person would lean back for a second and no longer calling this movie 'perfect', but when I hear that word, I expect people to mean what they say. And judging from the few hateful reviews I've seen on this one, it just doesn't quite make the cut. Second, I would be one of those people who happened to sit back for a portion of the movie, mostly after Don Vito came back from the gunshot scene. I was thrilled and angry at the same time, but seeing as how he went on with business as before, I figured it was a break in the movie for everyone to re-cap so far. Bottom line, I got lost a little after that. Again, if the Godfather were perfect, then it would have a prefect 10/10 overall rating as well, and not the 9.2 it currently has. Still, I recommend anyone who likes movies to watch this one. It will most likely be worth your while.",positive,10,tt0068646
"""What's the thing that I want most? Where do I want myself to be 10 years from now? What is that goal whose accomplishment will make me die a happy man? It's certainly not a chic apartment with a fat paycheck (some of it, but not all of it). The point is that they are simply a means to contentment, not happiness itself."" These were my thoughts when I finished watching Fight Club. Jesus, what a movie. It took me a whole evening to shake of the hangover. I was so hooked on to the theme of the movie. Mayhem...anarchy...the point of no return...nothing to lose. It all seems too good to resist at first. However, after a while, I say to myself, ""Hey! What was I thinking? I need to snap out of it. It's just Hollywood. Over-glamorized stuff. Nothing but marketing nihilism and calling it art...."" No amount of convincing proves to be too good though. These was one of the things that was here to stay. A doubt and that irresistible desire to push everything off the edge. Even if it offered no solution. No promise to change things. No hidden messages. Everything lashed straight out. On the face. Raw and powerful. But superbly stylized all the same. That's Fight Club. 8.5/10. P.S. That's the second movie that gave me an overpowering urge to start working out. The first one was off course, Rocky.",neutral,5,tt0137523
"I cannot believe this film is in the Top 5 of all time. Sure, it's packed full of action and the stunts are magnificent. But, in terms of the actual storyline and the script, it's a film like any other action film. The bad things: the film is too long (the ending should be half as long!), predictable plot (the film develops and finishes like any other action film), too many sub-plots (many scenes and sub-plots in the film were completely unnecessary). The good thing: The Joker! Heath Ledger is the only good side of the film, his way of delivering the script, his shocking appearance and his sense of ""evil"" really make him the best actor in the cast. Well, I think I have gone through the main aspects of the film. But keep in mind that it is still a good film, and is worth the watch!

"First of all, those having difficulty in understanding the movie have not watched all the 18 movies prior to IW. Everything in this movie is outstanding, and what most people ignore while rating is the fact that the story is yet to be completed.
The movie, as a whole, is written very nicely. Some details have been purposely kept out as they will be highlighted in the next Avengers movie, due to arrive on 2019. The character development is fine, as the makers have not shied about revealing the humane side of the superheroes. Thanos is the big baddy, and he dhows the megalomania we all love in a classic villain.

"I don't know what it is about this movie that people get so carried away with. I guess being under 20 helps, although I talked to some younger friends who thought the movie to be just as insipid, lame and boring as I did. I read that people find this movie's complexity to be one of its strong points. This is quite sad since it's about as complex as the basis of your average video game. I guess that same thing has set the standard to determine what is complex today in films and what is not. Complexity in my book has something to do with multiple layers, each with its own intrinsic appreciation, and is recognized rather easily. The effect namely being that when you miss a significant part of the story, like when watching a good detective, you no longer understand what is going on. I must have at least dozed off 3 times during Inception but wasn't even remotely challenged to work something out that wasn't already all too clear about 15 or 20 minutes in. The characters were unlikable and uninteresting across the board and the same rather goes for the whole of what the movie considers to be its plot. A James Bond type of story arc which doesn't really make the viewer care for it's outcome since such is already pretty clear because Nolan uses the same frigging formula. We got the secret agent, a pretty damsel, a world threat and a plethora of nameless villains with guns, some even on skimobiles! At any given point during ThaT particular scene, I expected a venerable Roger Moore to rush out from behind a snow covered spruce, cunningly herding his chasers into a trap of what appears to be 007's stretchable tie conjoined to and in between two trees. Inception is nothing more than the next action/chase time-waster laced with the compulsory CGI and endless fake-explanatory dialog as if it was breaking down a match between two chess masters. I found it all way too silly and turned it off 15 minutes before the credits rolled. Another cell phone company commercial stretched into feature film length with some big names attached for a complementary audience who can't tell, and couldn't care less to be able to tell, shït from Shinola. 5/10 for the otherwise competent direction, editing and sublime sound editing.",neutral,5,tt1375666
"I don't want to offend anyone, some of you actually seem quite intelligent, but listen up: If a movie is on the on top 250 list, in this case second from top, it simply states that this film is the second best liked film in the ""IMDB"" world. You can't argue that it don't deserve it just because it aren't as creative, innovative, artistic or influential as many other films are. ""THE SECOND BEST LIKED""! It's a fact. Swallow the truth. Movie lovers, as opposed to the general movie enjoyer, have, like most disciples of art a much more developed, or trained mind when it comes down to their field of obsession and will choose accordingly. (You can't expect your classmates to love jazz, prog rock and classical music, just because you do.) Shawshank Redemtion is, obviously, generaly an enormously likeable movie and even some of the most artsy people people I know accept it as valid and enjoyable entertainment. In my book it rates a solid 9/10. It's indeed, along with Back to the future (that ranks high much because it hit me so hard in my early youth.), my favourite mainstream movie of all time!

"Have watched the thing twice and frankly I still don't have a clue what the fuss is all about. There's hardly anything special about the movie, let alone breathtaking, intriguing or groundbreaking. The beginning is somewhat promising, but pretty soon it all gets painfully predictable right down to the moment the credits start rolling. The narrative is way too often overdrawn and phoney, the music - heavily pretentious and irritating. The performances are not bad, but let's face it - the script is far from demanding. The storytelling is overwhelmingly fairytale-ish and even the drastic bits seem oddly out of the place, as if thrown in to make the thing feel more dramatic. Words keep flowing in abundance, soothingly creating the impression of a nap story told by a lit fireplace. Having recently watched the ingenious ""The Straight Story"" I was astonished to see how much damage may be done to a picture by putting in too much talk. All that is not to say the movie is appaling. However, an inch above average is as good as it gets. Both ""Midnight Express"" and ""Escape From Alcatraz"" beat the weepy Shawshank experience hands down. 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0111161
"CF is about ""crazy"" genius leftists who opted to live off the grid in the wilderness and raise their prolific progeny in their own way. They spend all of their day hunting, gathering, reading, philosophizing, and cross-training. CF is a 2016 release that is rated 83 on RT/83 IMDB. It was written and directed by NYU filmmaking grad, Matt Ross of 28 Hotel Rooms. (Well, shizzle. It's Gavin Belson from Silicon Valley, my vote for funniest show of all time), ""As he began questioning the choices he and his wife were making as parents,"" per Wiki. ""He wondered what would happen if he were ""completely present"" in his children's lives while noting that modern technology had made that difficult."" Ross himself was raised in alternative-living communities. ""There are many Americas within the United States of America,"" he observes. This movie is worth watching as it challenges the monolithic system that invariably rolls on top of us all. The writing and dialogue are clever. It's a well done film. ""Captain Fantastic"" is the name of Elton John's 10th album. I did a couple searches but couldn't find commentary on the film's name. In an interview with Cameron Crowe, Elton John said, ""Captain Fantastic was written from start to finish in running order, as a kind of story about coming to terms with failure-or trying desperately not to be one. We lived that story."" The most popular song on the record is ""Someone Saved My Life Tonight,"" an all-timer for me. There's probably a connection in there somewhere. The acting is fierce and alive. Viggo Mortensen (The Lord of the Rings, Green Book) is Ben, the dad. ""Viggo was very adamant about making sure that everything was accurate,"" Ross states. Viggo is indefatigable. The film is, pretty much, Ben's 118 minute manic episode. Ben and wife Leslie Abigail Cash (Trin Miller) are like nitro & glycerin. They blow things up, socially. Frank Langella (Frost/Nixon, Kidding) is Jack, her upper-crustian father. The kids are nothing less than fabulous. George MacKay (1917, 11.22.63) plays Bodevan; Samantha Isler (Molly's Game) is Kielyr; Annalise Basso (Snowpiercer, Slender Man) portrays Vespyr, and Nicholas Hamilton (Action Royale, It) is the conflicted Rellian. CF is not something one watches for pure enjoyment. It puts the viewer through turmoil. My immediate reaction was infused with negativity, but I'm months behind in my reviews, and the time gap has made me see it more positively. It got under my skin. It's no surprise a genius would want to withdraw from society. The only way we regs survive is to ignore all the horror that goes on everywhere at every moment. That's why everyone is surprised when somebody dies, when no less than 2 people die every second in this world. We block out all the unpleasantness until it drops on us like a cartoon anvil. There's no perfect parent. What your comfort zone is, might feel like a cage to another. We all must decide how to raise our kids, and not one of us will do it perfectly. Is society entitled to intervene if a person wants to raise their kids off-grid? If we have national healthcare, then everyone's health becomes my business. Should I get to intervene if someone wants to live on Twinkies and Doritos? I can argue either way on that one, but I have a preference for freedom. Freedom is very messy. The dirty secret is that none of us act alone. What we do affects others. To keep freedom alive, we all must act responsibly, or laws will pile on top of laws until every single one of us is a miserable criminal. Matt Ross was ""thinking about my ""failures as a parent..."" and ""what I was passing on to my kids, or what I was not passing on to them."" When Ben & family must face tragedy, he tells the kids the absolute truth. He decides not to shield them - he's trying to be honest. ""Protecting children from certain truths they're too young to comprehend is not lying to them,"" we will hear. Well, he actually believes it is, depending on the circumstances, and in this case he wants to be honest with them. I doubt there is a blanket right or wrong answer to this. The same answer could probably be right for one sibling and wrong for another. Santa aside (not gonna go /there/) I don't believe it's right to lie to kids. Too much too soon is also unhealthy. Figure out a way to reveal truths and also protect - No one said parenting is easy. It's amusing when the kids turn the excellent critical thinking skills Ben took care to hone in them right back onto Ben. They can effectively argue with him, and they do. There's plenty of food for the intellect to gather and ponder. ""We're defined by our actions, not our words."" Ben is emphatic. People who can pinpoint the problems don't necessarily have the solutions. We shut down our thinking too easily. We love their words, so we ignore what they do. This is politics. Ben worships, more than anything, Noam Chomsky. Chomsky did ""good"", and engaged the culture, but Ben hides away? Chomsky is just a man - an articulate man who can identify problems, but not necessarily the most workable solutions. Left, Right, Centrist - Don't follow a man - never blindly. That's misplaced trust. Every person is changing at every moment, anyway, so keep your eyes open. Organized religion is slammed. That's fair. The problem with organized religion - wait a sec; we'll expand that to include organized belief systems so that we can bring our atheists and secular humanists into the fold - the problem with every belief system is that people corrupt it. Chomsky & so many others love to decry the inquisition (rightly so) which has an estimated body count of 3-5k. Atheists and secular humanist governments racked up a death toll of over 100M in the 20th century. We're defined by our actions, not our words, indeed! Ben becomes like the worst fundamentalist Christians with his self-righteous condescending pride. Pride. It's always the worst problem, and we rarely see it in ourselves. It's the main problem with smart people - they think they know everything. It is what causes every system to get corrupted, religious and otherwise. The height of the film is when they leave the wilderness and go into civilization and meet their cousins. This sets up the contrast of coddled suburban ignoramuses vs sheltered, cloistered, but highly educated kids. Both families know, in absolute terms, that the other family is #wrong. The human desire to control others is pathological. We may not agree with how someone raises their kids, but any attempt at control makes them dig in. It's almost as if we are all hopelessly lost in a vat of information with few tools to fish out the lies. There's no 100% right way to raise children. Parents of 4 or more kids usually see at least 1 go bad. I actually love the way Ben talks to his kids. He's worth emulating from that respect. He explains much more than the suburban drones, whose kids will melt at the first sign of adversity. Communication is key to making the patterns of the world bite-sized for future adults. It's lazy to just point at the problems and go our merry way feeling superior. Sadly, that's most people's favorite hobby. Ben only thought about how he wanted his family life to be, not about what his kids' adult lives would look lIke. Ironically, he's denying them friendship, romance and intimacy even more than strict religious parents would. What was missing was love. Ben is results driven - he puts all his time into the kids, which is how he shows love. But not all the kids feel that love. The family loves eachother but they don't express it. Thus is the hamster wheel of human thinking and behavior. It does seem like Ben's efforts will pay off, in the end. He isn't foisting humans onto society that will be part of the problem. His kids will be achievers. QUOTES📢 S. T. O. P.

"Simply put, this is the best movie ever. First off, lets talk about the acting. Edward Norton gives a great performance along with Brad Pitt. There was not ONE flaw in the acting of this movie. The writing in this movie is some of the greatest, taking great quotes from the book. I can't believe Fincher has not done that many movies, this is the best directing I have ever seen. The Overall style of this movie is really original. This movie will be a love it or hate it type movie. I think if you are the American Beauty/Pulp Fiction type then you may like this movie.

"... really not in such a shabby fashion.  Tony Kaye's direction leaves much to be desired, and the musical decisions within the film make you feel like you're watching The Last of the Mohicans, and not a contemporary film about race.  Derek Vinyard's transformation from skinhead to savior is admirable, but even this main character's development is done poorly, as are the other roles.  The plot (though somewhat lacking in sophistication) is engaging enough, yet Edward Norton's superb acting alone saves this piece from being completely unwatchable -- further convincing this viewer how much better this movie would have been under different direction.  I'm sad to conclude that this is yet another movie highly undeserving of its lofty ranking. 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0120586
"Most films that use voice over narration are sophomoric efforts at best, mainly because voice over tends to be used as compensation for lack of good storytelling tools. That is, one of the first rules of fiction being ""show, don't tell"", a film ought to be able to convey its intent without directly telling the audience anything. However the film makers pulled it off, Fight Club's narration actually works as an enhancement to a film. Perhaps it is because the narrator never actually gives any information; perhaps because Norton's commentary is sardonically amusing. The fact is, it manages to succeed where thousands of films leave the viewer gritting their teeth in irritation. But this doesn't explain why Fight Club is worthy of the big 10/10. In addition to sharp directing, entertaining dialog, and talented cast, Fight Club wipes away the paper thin veneer of weak civility that replaces the raw, honest reactions so sadly lacking in contemporary culture. It is a refreshing breath of fetid air, so free of the insultingly cheap perfume of imitation sympathy and courtesy, that the viewer is made glad to experience the visceral, id-inspired attitudes of the characters on the screen. However immature and reprehensible the thoughts expressed may be, at least they are not patronizing themselves and others by pasting a Spackle of uninspired, new age crocodile tears many find themselves pressured to display. Perhaps that is what is most personal in this case. This is only a fraction of what Fight Club has to offer, as it not only tears at the materialization and feminization of modern culture, but stylistically renders a vivid portrayal of a madness that is itself a cure for a greater madness. This madness is that which is experienced by those who have been subtly told through constant media reinforcement how to mold into the ideal human being; an ideal that is never held by those who adopt it, but is given them by advertisement and the weak minded who won't bring themselves to spew out a foul tasting wad of mucous for fear of offending somebody they will never meet, about whom they truly care nothing. If this review appears relatively vague, it is deliberately so. It is not intended as an attempt to intellectualize the film because the language is just meant to convey what is interpreted as theme. Fight Club is one movie that should never be spoiled by a review. There are no specifics given here because every rendition done by anybody other than the actors involved (or Chuck Palahniuk himself) has always fallen short of the memorable manner in which the film delivers. The pseudo-intellectual psychobabble of this review is simply an amateurish attempt to create meaning without trespassing into the sacred experience that is Fight Club. Whether the above review hits a mark or sounds like chicken scratch, Fight Club ought to have a liberating effect of some kind on almost any viewer. Almost seven years after its release, Fight Club still hits with bone shattering inspiration and head splitting satisfaction. Watch with reckless abandon.",positive,10,tt0137523

It is absolutely ridiculous. It takes away all credibility the film tries to have. I wanted to cringe and laugh at the same time whenever batman spoke. Not only is it overly gruff like a child pretending to be scary but it also sounds like Batman is trying to speak whilst in the dentists chair having a check-up. Bale can't even do it right!

"Fight Club earns a 4/10 for its intense and psychologically complex narrative that, while critically acclaimed, can be unsettling and hard to watch for some viewers. The film delves deep into the disturbed psyches of its main characters, which makes for a discomforting viewing experience. The movie is known for its dark themes and the exploration of mental illness, which are portrayed through the lives of its complex characters. While these elements are crafted to challenge and provoke thought, they can also be overwhelming and distressing. The film's portrayal of violence and psychological turmoil, intended to reflect deeper societal issues, might be too intense for some viewers. Additionally, the twisted nature of the characters' minds and the blurring lines between reality and illusion in the film can make it a confusing and challenging watch. The narrative's complexity, although intriguing, can be hard to follow and might leave viewers feeling perplexed rather than engaged. In summary, Fight Club is a film that certainly has its merits in terms of acting and direction, but its heavy psychological themes and disturbing content limit its appeal. It's a movie that scores high in terms of cinematic craftsmanship but might not be enjoyable or comfortable for all audiences, hence the lower rating.",negative,4,tt0137523
"I just needed to watch this movie to get it over with, especially hearing that it's the movie with the most f-words ever. I thought, ""Wow, really? Let's see how bad this is."" Yeah, I'm a film snob, and I never take any attitude or bad words from any movies, and cast them upon others. Thank G-d. With that said, pretty much every single one of Martin Scorsese's movies are so hard to watch. They're dark & sinful! What? Does Martin sell his soul to the devil every time he makes these? If it's supposed to be ""REALITY"", we get it, but leave the reality-telling to the professionals if you PLEASE! What is going through Martin Scorsese's HEAD? Frankly the only film from him I have liked from him is HUGO (2011). A film almost anyone can watch & be mesmerized. Check it out, you won't be disappointed. THIS film is putrid garbage, filled with vulgar language, sexual perverseness, and quite possibly the most unlikable characters ever put on-screen. Leonardo DiCaprio is quite possibly the worst actor since Jim Varney's coffin - all he can do is shout & swear. How's that ""acting""?? Is the F-word the only word in his dictionary?????? Cursing & swearing is a degenerate sarcasm for those who have lost their decent vocabulary. DiCaprio should have RETIRED perhaps after Titanic. There are some exceptions to the rule of course, but most child actors grow up to be talentless hacks; no doubt DiCaprio's one of them. Apparently, why didn't he die, instead of Paul Walker? It's really sad that the real Jordan Belfort is Jewish. Jewish people are the original chosen people blessed by G-d. Blessed through Abraham, they were given amazing wisdom & intelligence. And a lot more Jewish people got involved in this movie (ie. Jonah Hill, Rob Reiner, Jon Favernau, etc.) It's just SAD that a lot of people are born into this world with a G-d-given intelligence, but they use the totally wrong way for the totally wrong things. They just ruin themselves & other people! Throughout history, Jewish people have turned out to be incredibly smart & intelligent people. And Albert Einstein, Emma Lazarus, Ben Stein, Larry King, Wolf Blitzer, FRED, VenomFangX, Adam Brody, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Adam Levine, Adrian Brody, Billy Crystal, Jack Black, Seth Rogen, Jerry Seinfeld, Liev Schreiber, Paul Shaffer, Ron Perlman, The Coen brothers, Paul Rudd, Milton Berle, Mel Brooks are just SOME of them. Even MORE sad that most comedians get their inspiration from Lenny Bruce who was ALSO Jewish - it's just ALL wasted potential.

"Movies based on video games seem to be a hopeless thought. And it's not so strange really. Considering that most successful games are heavily influenced by movies in different ways it becomes almost a contradiction when movies are then being based on games... ""Doom"" is like some sort of mixture between on one hand ""Aliens"" and on the other movies like ""Resident Evil"". The ""Resident Evil""-similarities are striking in many cases, which is perhaps not so strange considering that they are both video games, although games of a very different nature. When it comes to the ""Aliens"" part it always seem to me that action movies that put a lot of horror in the mix and places the protagonists on a desolate place try to emulate ""Aliens"". And why not, i hold ""Aliens"" to be among the best action movies ever made and one of my favorite movies regardless of genres. ""Doom"" tries to lighten things up with a few small tricks. Like for instance the nod to game-players where they name a few characters after the game's developers, and of course the by now (in)famous ""first-person-view""-scene. What i don't understand though is why they have chosen to leave so much else from the games out. If i remember correctly the monsters in the original ""Doom"" came from a portal to hell that was opened by mistake. Here it's rather some sort of zombie-thing and ancient martians running around. Why they would change things in this way is beyond me. In the end this is just another sad action movie lacking all the aspects that make a GOOD action movie. There is no pulse-raising action, there is no true excitement. Rather ""Doom"" barely has a pulse at all. It's one of those movies where they think it's enough to have guys with huge biceps running around with huge weapons talking like military caricatures. This is simply a movie that would never have been made at all if it weren't for the fact that thousands of gaming fans will be at least a little bit intrigued - perhaps enough to actually pay for a ticket or a rental. 2/10",negative,2,tt0419706

His character is vulgar, obnoxious, and over-the-top which I know many people will find silly or offensive but I personally thought it was hilarious. I also thought newcomer Jonathan Rhys Meyers was pretty good in his role and not a total tool like I first thought. The story is well paced and there is plenty of action.

The chinese girl's acting was absolutely terrible, and whoever played the transporter also had pretty bad acting skills. This movie had several considerable flaws and plot holes. The most annoying part of it is the ending. I was all prepared for a really good action scene and it just stopped. Then I was disappointed. By all costs, avoid this film. Rent The Matrix. Rent Gladiator. Anything but this crap. For those of you who like guns, be prepared for a disappoinment. There were about 2 minutes of guns in the whole film.

This is just good, but no great. Why?!? Star Trek is way worse, so stick to this rather than star trek. I'm noit saying this is bad, It's very, Very Entertaining and all the sequels were good (Except Empire Strikes Back, That was SOO Boring). Don't join fan clubs and worship this movie. Watch it on a Friday night if you have nothing better to do, But Don't excpect an Amazing Movie. Rating: 6.5/10 P.S. Star Wars Geeks/Nerds: Please don't hunt me down and kill me for not liking your movie as much as you!",neutral,5,tt0076759
"Solo: A Star Wars Story does not seem like a disappointment at first glance, that is of course at first glance. When I went to see Solo I was excited but not overjoyed or hyped, recently I have been angered and annoyed by the amount of Star Wars movies that have been made without any real thought put into them. Rogue One was a money project, not a passion project. Also while this movie is not a politically correct as recent movies, it still clearly has a hidden agenda. Agendas like this are harmful to our children and will sway their opinions for life. Now back to my seeing of it, when I saw Solo there were TONS and I mean TONS of fan boys. They will tell you it was perfect and amazing, and I know that because I missed half the dialogue from their clapping. The reason they will tell you it was amazing is because this movie is a pander fest. Reference to extended universe here, reference to the prequels there, it was a mess of references just like Ready Player One. Now the acting, the main two actors that stood out were Donald Glover and Alden. First Alden: He was AMAZING, just like a little Harrison Ford, he captured the personality of Han Solo so perfectly that I wouldn't mind seeing Laden in an Indiana Jones movie or two. Now Donald Glover: unbelievable and horrible is all I can say. Noting he said was convincing or felt like it had any impact on the movie or audience. This is why you don't hire a MUSIC artist as an ACTOR. Two forms of entertainment that should only mix in the soundtrack. 
Overall this is just one movie in the plethora of Star Wars over saturated garbage that will be released. This is why I gave Solo: A Star Wars Story a 4/10. I can only hope they slow down the making of these movies and put thought and passion into new Star Wars movies.",negative,4,tt3778644
"VERY DISAPPOINTED with Wolf of Wall Street!! I have watched every single movie for Leonardo Dicaprio as he is one of my best actors and I usually find his movies extraordinary and very entertaining but Wolf of Wall Street had no plot and no context at all! A long boring movie that was supposed to be based on a true story that lacks the details of what really happened with just too much sex scenes and drug use that adds nothing to the storyline!! This is my first review here on IMDb. I wish they had the option of choosing 0/10. I repeat, don't pay for it.",negative,0,tt0993846
"This movie is pure excellency.I love every aspect of it.It's one of those movies that you can watch many times without getting bored. The story is about Andy, played by Tim Robbins, who has just been found guilty and sent to prison to serve a life sentence,where he meets Red,played by Morgan Freeman, and with time they form a bond. Shawshank Redemption has it all,and during the movie you can feel a big spectrum of emotions,from feeling happy for the characters,angry at them,fearing for their well being,and being really sad for them.This movie takes you on a roller coaster ride through all of those.The acting is top notch and the actors performance is so good that you can see the personality of each character and start bonding with them.One of my favourite things about this movie is the Morgan Freeman's narrating skill,you can easily see the movie through his eyes due to his convincing acting.It also shows how people, when they get locked up for a long amount of time,start to adapt that kind of life,the prison becomes their world and in time ,that's all they know.Their life used to be bigger,but now it got scaled down to simple pleasures.For an example, when the guards but the prisoners a few beers,they get really happy,they feel free once again,well at least for a couple of minutes. I would recommend it to everyone 10/10",positive,10,tt0111161
"One of those revenge thrillers that can make even the most hardened viewers squirm, I Saw the Devil is a brilliant tale about revenge and loss delivering cinematic goods alongside a twisted human drama. The direction of the film is a standout from the cinematography, editing and action set pieces. Director Kim Jee-woo and cinematographer Lee Mo-gae establishes a moody set with dazzling camera movements. Violence is portrayed without reservation for visceral effect. Scenes are presented to let viewers absorb the emotions and conflict between the characters. The action is breath taking in every word as the gore and violence blend to perfection. Unlike other similar films, the story resonates because underneath the spectacle is an arc of grief, loss and retribution. The main character, Kim Soo-hyun, played by Lee Byung-hun is driven by the death of his wife at the hands of a serial killer, Jang Kyung-chul, played by Choi Min-sik. As the story plays out his revenge comes not only at Jang but also to innocent people and those close to him. Kim intends not only to kill Jang but to torture him and feel the agony his wife endured at his hands. Despite the unrelenting violence, it never fails to be contemplative and introspective and both Lee and Choi dazzle as men with twisted motives. The ending basically sums up the entire point of the film. After his revenge, Kim does not have his wife back. He could only break down crying. I Saw the Devil is a must watch for its entertainment and artistic values. -8.5/10",neutral,5,tt1588170
"Where do I start with this one? There's not a single thing about this that prevents it from being one of the worst films I've ever seen. The amount of technical problems become very clear very quickly. The painfully obvious continuity errors, the awful overdubbing (which was supposedly done my three people - voicing all the actors in the film), the abysmal acting and the fact that the film is a complete bore (despite its runtime of just over an hour). I mean, this film isn't even worthy of a 'so-bad-it's-good' status. It really is that bad. However, the Torgo character is definitely intriguing especially after reading up on John Reynolds (the actor who plays Torgo) which explained many things about his character. Overall, I think Manos is better studied than enjoyed since the latter is virtually impossible. 1/10",negative,1,tt0060666
"The Dark Knight is a dark, complex and unforgettable movie. It succeeds not just as an entertaining comic book film, but as a richly thrilling crime saga. The Marketing was off the charts but what really set this movie extravagant was the performance by Heath Ledger. It doesn't really matter about his death, the way of how he opened himself as a violent and murderous psychopath, causing chaos and committing crimes for his own amusement made this film a rave. The Dark Knight is just impressive and the moral dilemma is at it's question about whether a vigilante has to abandon his code in order to defeat the villain. The performances, direction, writing, and score redefines this film a thrilling, entertaining crime saga.",negative,2,tt0468569
"16 years and 7 films ago the Fast & Furious franchise wasn't the worldwide phenomena that it is now. It was once a cheesy Point Break rip-off that took itself way too seriously. But you know what, it was a darn good guilty pleasure movie. That's for sure. A lot has changed over the years in the series, but the one constant has always been that the films are about family. For all its faults, no one can deny how well this film does the family angle. It's not the best acting, writing, or directing, but you care enough about the characters to where you believe the motivations behind characters' actions regarding family. But let's talk about how ridiculous, stupid, and fun this movie is. They drive their cars (successfully) underneath semi-trucks several times throughout the film. So much so that when I was younger I believed it was possible. That word, ""possible"", will be used sparingly through the course of this film and the entire series. Where Furious 7 pushes the boundaries of reality by driving cars via one building to the next, The Fast and the Furious provides the unbelievable through street car races with seemingly a few hundred people. In the middle of the night, that is. Oh and those hundreds of people each have their own car and parking spot, that is. But that won't be the last time the film could have you roll your eyes. In fact, it's way easier to watch this film now that I've seen every installment to date. This film is extremely dated, but it's an interesting watch, especially considering where the series has gone to now. There's an underground motorcycle gang who steals DVD players and stashes them in a Thai-food restaurant. The climax of the film begins at an event called Race Wars. Creative huh? At one point, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) tells someone to back off or she will scar her face with tire tracks. I guess my point is, if you don't accept the film for what it is, I don't think you'll have any fun with it. The real joy of this film comes by its goofiest and most outlandish moments, but also with its impressive stunts and action. In camera stunts may be this franchise's finest assets, and the last highway heist in this film is a thing of beauty. Yes, the film gets bogged down by a really dated and contrived script, but there's so much undeniable fun to be had here. A guilty pleasure movie at its best +Stunts/action +All about family +Ridiculously goofy/fun -Horrible script, and passable acting -Takes itself a little too serious at times 7.5/10",neutral,5,tt0232500

"Impressive and very nice. There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now
.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox.",positive,10,tt0068646
"An Office worker spends his time looking for fulfilment in various support groups, when he randomly encounters a soap maker named Tyler Durden, the pair discover a mutual, but strange and violent past time. There is no doubt in my mind, Fight Club is one of the best films of all time, a story like no other, even for someone that doesn't care for this film, I'm sure they'd agree that it's original. Fight Club is fast paced, action packed, intriguing, sexy, revealing and timeless, it's one of those films that it doesn't matter how many times you watch it, it doesn't lose any of its appeal. At times it is genuinely outrageous, and therein is its monumental appeal. Helena Bonham Carter steals so many films, and she's terrifiic here, but it's the combination of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt that makes the film, they are outstanding, I still think it's Norton's best performance to date. The wonderful, late Meatloaf adds a nice bit of humour. The moral of Fight Club......don't have the soup. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0137523

"I went and saw the Dark Knight last night and have to say, I was absolutely blown away by this movie. The acting was spot-on especially Heath Ledger who I thought produced one of the best villain performances ever! He was so indulged in his character it was unbelievable. If Heath's performance doesn't earn him a 'Best Supporting Actor' award it will be a travesty. It's such a shame that Heath left us prematurely as he was beginning to be known as one of the best actors on the planet and his performance as The Joker proved this. Aside from Ledger, the acting as a whole from everybody was superb. Bale, Oldman, Caine and Freeman were typically astute in their performances as well. The movie had a very interesting storyline which had me hooked until the credits rolled. It had the perfect mixture of dark suspense and action which, by comparison, makes the Spiderman movies look almost laughable. I would recommend that everyone sees this movie. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0468569
"I enjoyed the first film and could barely wait for this movie to be released. Well I was entertained (and this is by no way a bad movie) there are a few issues I have with it. The first and most obvious being Faramir. Faramir is supposed to be the opposite of his brother, strong and not prone to the usual weaknesses of men. But Peter Jackson portrays him as being corrupted by the ring as soon as he sets eyes on it. Yes, he does eventually let Frodo go but there was no need for this alteration to have ever been made. It really spoiled the film for me. The only other big thing was the ENT's. This didn't bother me as much as Faramir, but it was still an unnecessary change from the book. The ENT's are supposed to agree in the ENT Moot that they will fight in the war - not the way they do it in the film. Oh yeah - and the attack on Isengard, I know its difficult in film to show ENT's digging a new path for a river over a couple of days - but what idiot builds his fortress next to a massive, crumbling dam ??? Winging over. Apart from these major (and a couple of minor points) I did still enjoy the film and probably would have enjoyed it a lot more if I hadn't already read the books. 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0167261
"The Silence of the Lambs earns a 6/10 from me for being a suspenseful thriller with a storyline that, while captivating, ventures into unsettling territories of the human psyche. While the film is undeniably well-crafted and boasts compelling performances, its dark and twisted narrative was a bit too intense for my taste. The film's portrayal of a serial killer and the psychological depths it explores is both intriguing and disturbing. The plot's complexity, combined with the chilling character of Hannibal Lecter, makes for a gripping watch, but the sheer darkness of the story's themes can be overwhelming. It's a film that delves deeply into the morbidity of its characters, which, while fascinating for some, can be distressing for others. What stands out in The Silence of the Lambs is the remarkable performance of Anthony Hopkins as Lecter, bringing a chilling and memorable portrayal to the screen. Jodie Foster's role as Clarice Starling is equally noteworthy, adding depth and intensity to the film. However, the very brilliance of these performances contributes to the film's intense and often disturbing atmosphere. In conclusion, while The Silence of the Lambs is a classic in the thriller genre, known for its suspense and psychological depth, its exploration into the darker aspects of the human mind made it a challenging watch for me. The film's disturbing themes and storyline, though skillfully presented, were a bit too much, leading to my 6/10 rating.",neutral,6,tt0102926
"CGI was of the highest order. The planets were ok, the first heist mission was breathtaking. It was shot so well. The world felt darker and more unforgiving than the one represented in E I,II . Acting was ok and young Solo looked and played well. He is not Harrison Ford but I believe that he did a good job. The problem here has come down to the plot. The story was uninspiring and I lost interest midway through. I watched it all and overall enjoyed it but quickly forgot about it and I am not feeling inclined to watch it again. So I will give it 6/10. Good movie to watch but it will not covert you to the light side.",neutral,6,tt3778644

So, strap in for a good time. Keep your arms inside the ship at all times.

"I have no Idea why this has been getting such great reviews. Granted, if Scorcese had carried on like he did in the first 40 minutes of the movie, this could have been brilliant, but I think he's getting slow in his old age. At about halfway through this movie you'll see what I mean. Suddenly there is too much going on at once and it turns into a stupid ""everybody suspects everybody else"" cop drama with ridiculous plot twists to boot. The last 20 mins are totally stupid and unnecessary, so I would walk out before they start. Other than that, it's not all bad.

The HK movie was a notch ahead in the tech department too..The most high tech gadget shown was a camera cell phone..

Leprchaun 3 has just as many gory deaths and great humor like the first and second one. I think the second is still my favorite so far, but still, I wouldn't say no to seeing the third one again. Warwick Davis once again reprises the role, and taking the leprechaun to newer and better levels than before! Leprechaun 3 is about a magician who once again, you can guess it, he takes the leprechaun's gold. He intends to run of with his lovely assistant, but when she turns him down, smart move, because the leprechaun is on his case! Not to mention that a few more greedy people get their hands on the gold as well, wishing for things that they should think about before they wish with this certain leprechaun! My favorite death was the lady who wished she was beautiful, now how could a wish like that go bad? Well, big lips, bad skin, big butt, that causes her to explode! That was one of my favorite scenes of the leprechaun series. I think others would agree. Leprechaun 3 is a great addition and I hope it continues.

"The biggest problem facing franchises is the fact they are a franchise. They offer up a product that looks and acts in a certain way and the net result of that, is it can be very, very hard to reinvent that proposition in a manner that's new and novel. This is precisely the dilemma I believe is inherent in Avengers:Infinity Wars. If this was the first film of its kind it would probably have gotten peoples attention for presenting an outlandish and to a degree stylish concept, that's new and fresh. Unfortunately, there is nothing new in this formula and its been a long, long time since its been fresh. The premise is effectively always much the same. Super skilled heroes versus one or more super skilled villains, with the stake being the salvation of a country, a planet, the universe. That's pretty much it. This film does deviate a little from the expected theme, with a surprise ending but that's not enough to save it from being yet another film in a franchise that looks ""all the same"". On the upside the special effects are excellent and there is some reasonable if not show stopping acting from the collected cast. That I'm afraid is it. I do sympathise with the production house, its hard to know what to do with this concept or where to take it next. I certainly have no answer. That said this film is what it is.

However, I wasn't that much invested in the two others,especially quicksilver who I think was more of weak point in the movie,in addition to some little plot holes like the first appearance of nick fury and the way the avengers have defeated ultron ... overall, I think that this movie is the perfect continuation of the MCU, and an amazing mixture of fun,humour with some solid action and great characters development. 8.3/10",negative,3,tt2395427

"The Omen 1976 is a classic example of scaring the jimmies off of someone, making their bones jump right out of their skin! This film creep-ed the hell out of me when I first watched it, I mean who isn't afraid of someone who they think is just innocent. Who thinks that a little boy is bound to be the one causing the deaths of innocent people? Well it's little five year old Damien Thorn! I won't go too much into this since everyone has had to see this. The film starts off with an ambassador's wife getting pregnant but she loses the child and is replaced with a new child. This new child starts showing different signs and later on (after been persuaded heaps), the ambassador, Robert Thorn believes his son is the anti-Christ. Really excellent story which really kicks ""The Exorcist"" right out the window. This story keeps you wondering what's happening, pandering on how it's all going to ravel up and what mysterious lie within that cute, innocent cherub Damien. I'm not giving any scenes or nothing away, nothing, GO and watch it if you haven't seen it. All I will say is that it's suspenseful, it keeps you on the edge like other old horror classics have and the score by Jerry GoldSmith is created beautifully in this film. First he builds up with emotion and some happiness, and that he goes deep making is booming and loud as hell!

"I gave the first V/H/S a 6/10 and referred to it as very uneven and having more misses than hits. This one, however, is much better and I actually enjoyed a majority of the film. If I were to rate the segments: Tape 49/frame narrative - I never really care for the wrap-around stories in these films. This one was no different, although i did find it better than the wrap-around in the first one. 6/10 Phase I Clinical Trials - In my opinion, this is the strongest short in the film. Although one of the others may be more professionally made this is the scariest and my favourite. 9/10 A Ride in the Park - A really unique idea that is quite entertaining, but becomes a bit gimmicky and doesn't have a good enough payoff. 7/10 Safe Haven - Probably the best segment in terms of film-making, although not as scary as ""Phase 1 CLinical Trials"" for me. It's the longest, but I was never bored at any point and got pretty freaked out watching it. The ending could have been better, but apart from that it's great. 9/10 Slumber Party Alien Abduction - The kids are super annoying. The special effects and sound design and everything are great though. The ending was a bit anti-climactic, but it's still an entertaining watch. 6.5/10",neutral,6,tt2450186
"the most annoying thing about this movie is that people claim to like it because it's so revolutionary in it's style and complexity... Cause then i look back on other movies, like 'lost highway' and everyone hates it. Well folks this movie isn't all that revolutionary. First off i'd like to mention a certain convience of this movie, how can the main character remember that he has a memory disorder, yet can't remember anything else? Think about it, he'd constantly live in the present, and be completely unaware of living in the present, the only way he'd know he was living in the present would be if someone was there to tell him that. So that's a MAJOR plot hole. that's not the worst thing about the movie, the worst thing is that the character's are flat, the plot is flat - C'mon a plot about a guy searching for the guy who killed his wife, with NO twists (if seen without the contrived plot)boring characters, and lame dialogue. Watched in regular motion this movie is not interesting at all. Some people were comparing this to Lynch. Well, comparing it to what lynch has done so far, he ALWAYS uses interesting characters and great atmosphere to tell his stories, not just some lame plot contrivance. The movie isn't terrible, it has it's moments, but it's annoying that it's getting so much praise when movies like lost highway get trashed. Look at Pulp Fiction, Tarantino didn't use just the plot contrivence to make his movie interesting... oh ya and i didn't re read this, bollocks to all the grammar and spelling errors! 5/10 Boring, contrived story, with flat characters, the only saving grace is the surprises that occasionally pop up. Although the movie is ultimately completely let down by a REALLY lame ending, c'mon, they could've thought of something more interesting... If they had i would've considered giving this a 6 or 7.

"'The Snowman' had so much going for it. The Norwegian setting (Norway has some of the most beautiful scenery in Europe), a brilliant book, a great cast (usually can't go much wrong with Michael Fassbender and JK Simmons), the involvement of 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' director Tomas Alfredson and one of the best premises of the year. Sadly, what was one of the year's films with the greatest potential and what should have been one of the best if done right turned out to be one of 2017's most disappointing and worst films. Have seen enough films this year, a hit and miss year with films on both sides of the good and bad spectrum and other in between efforts, to feel this way, before this opinion is attacked. Not in a long time has a film with so much potential start so promisingly, with one of the creepiest first 10 minutes of the year, have that potential completely melted after the opening and become increasingly buried under the snow as much as 'The Snowman'. The waste of a great premise, book, cast, opening sequence and director is unforgivable. Good things first. As said, 'The Snowman' gets off to a very promising start. The first ten minutes is genuinely creepy and atmospheric. The other redeeming quality is most of the production values, the photography is slick and stylish and makes affectionate use of beautiful and suitably chilly settings. Can say nothing good about everything else however. As an adaptation of the book, 'The Snowman' completely cuts the flesh off the bones, leaving only the bare bones of the story and characters. What was so great about the source material is removed here and executed in a way that's the complete opposite. However, any adaptation deserves to be judged on its own terms and unfortunately 'The Snowman' fails as a standalone, to me even it's even more of a failure in this regard. With a great cast on paper, 'The Snowman' should have had great performances. In reality, the performances are all round awful, even from those who are usually good or more, and sees some career-worst work from some. Michael Fassbender is a complete blank in a role he should have excelled in, it's a kind of role he's perfect at so it was a shock to see him so bad. Rebecca Ferguson is especially poor in a role that would be beneath any actress regardless of the extent of their acting ability. The chemistry between the actors, especially Fassbender and Ferguson, is frostbitten. There are also some very inconsistent accents going on. You know there's something wrong when the best and most memorable performance is given by Val Kilmer and he still unbalances the film by how bizarrely he is made to act as a character completely inconsequential to the film. In fairness a lot works against them. 'The Snowman' is directed with sluggish indifference by Alfredson, who does decently with the style but makes a complete hack job of the storytelling, which is not what one expects from him judging from his previous work. 'The Snowman' suffers from too many characters and subplots that are either under-explored (Fassbender is hindered by that the character has nothing to him in terms of development other than the type of character he is and too many of the subplots are resolved unsatisfactorily, silly or left in the air) or pointless. Regarding the script, there was a lot of awkwardness here and some chuckles that were clearly unintentional, emotional impact was as non-existent as the suspense. 'The Snowman' does an unbelievably poor job creating suspense, which is practically none after the opening, and instead lays it on thick with incredibly dull pacing, un-scary (almost listless) scares and unintentional and perplexing humour. The ending is an absolute joke, the reveal is not a surprise at all and it is further ruined by being insultingly ridiculous and illogical. While it mostly looks good, the editing is at times chaotic and the effects are shoddy. The music is okay on its own but often doesn't fit with what's going on and can be overbearing, while the sound is far too obviously used and intrusive. Overall, a huge disappointment, one of the biggest wastes of great potential in recent years. 2/10 Bethany Cox",negative,2,tt1758810
"The first time I heard that Disney was flirting with the possibility of making a Han Solo prequel I was out. In fact I felt the same way when it was announced that Lucasfilm would be producing spin-off films. I've always been a Saga film geek and although I would welcome other Star Wars anthology films I would always warn against the threat of franchise fatigue. Star Wars is the biggest movie franchise of all time and it got there by producing six films over 28 years and at no point felt the necessity to have yearly releases. And while Star Wars fatigue might be reeling in is Solo able to surpass expectations?
To be fair I had really low expectations regarding this film, my excitement was't very high either. But as I sat down last night and watched it I am pleased to say that I had a great time. Solo is by the numbers when it comes to the plot and even more so if you know Han's Legends backstory. The plot is straight forward and very small in scope which is refreshing in a franchise where planets blow up left and right. However as a result of this streamlined plot and the fact that this movie is a prequel the steaks are not very high since we know that some events must occur. Having said that it's still very fun seeing how these events actually took place even though we know the outcome. 
One aspect of the film that worried me a lot was how would they characterize Han. They did a great job of showing us how Han was like before ANH(A New Hope) but the film doesn't really take Han to where he is character-wise in the original Star Wars. So in this respect the movie feels incomplete as It's obvious that Lucasfilm plans to explore this transformation into the hardened rogue in future installments. 
Thankfully the film does stay away from some prequel clichés and is not stuffed to the brim with in your face callbacks to other Star Wars material. However if you are a Star Wars geek like myself you will find a lot of hidden value in the form of verbal nods, artifacts and general Easter-eggs sprinkled throughout the run-time. 
Finally the cast was great and my fears that Alden Ehrenreich would never be able to be a convincing Han were thrown out the wayside as he is charismatic and fun as Han with out having to do an exact impersonation. He gives Han his own spin but it still feels just like Han Solo should as he very well emulates some of the classic Han mannerisms and speech patterns. Donald Glover is okay as Lando but I enjoyed Alden Ehrenreich's performance way more and to be fair I think Glover's performance is being overrated by the critics. Woody Harrelson was great as Beckett, a gun slinging space bad ass who becomes a father figure for Han, heck even Emilia Clarke was good as Qi'ra. Paul Bettany was also great as the films antagonist but his short screen-time was a bit of a bummer. 
Now that I've discussed the cast I need to talk about my absolute favorite aspect of this film and that is the relationship between Han and Chewbacca. It feels very genuine and sweet, it'a funny and solid and it is the foundation of this film. Chewie steals the show to be quite frank and it's so worth it, I might have to say that this is the most fun I've ever had while watching Chewie it is truly that good. He not only has some great moments in the action set-pieces but he also has some really hysterical moments as well. Which is a great segue into the comedy and how organic it feels. In contrast to episode 7 or 8 the comedy in the film happens organically and it's not over the head humor like the Marvel films. It actually hearkens back to the humor in the original trilogy which was subtle not glaringly obvious. 
On the negative side of the spectrum it would be hard to delve in deeply because some of my gripes with the film are bathed in the spoiler territory. However I wasn't a fan of certain decisions made by the writers of the film, without any spoilers I wasn't at all a fan of the new droid character since it was a walking talking embodiment of a Star Wars SJW, I wasn't a fan of the character at all. It is also worth mentioning that the movie has some really great characters but unfortunately some of my favorites aren't in the movie for a whole long which is a major bummer. 
Overall ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" turned out much better than what I hoped, It's not a masterpiece but it's a very fun summer blockbuster with a solid story and characters, some awesome action and magnificent special effects. The humor is great and the fun factor is real here so I would recommend a watch if you're on the fence as I was. I'm actually surprised to say that I would like to see where they take this story from here and would actually be interested in giving a sequel a shot. But as a Star Wars film it's not top tier but it sure is really fun and worth a shot. Who knows, maybe you'll like it more than I did since this film caters a bit more to the casual audience. As of one viewing my score is a solid 7.5/10.",neutral,5,tt3778644
"After the first 10 minutes I was thinking to myself this is going to be excellent. After the 11th minute I realized I was sadly mistaken and it was just the same old, same old action thing. The title character played by Jason Statham was just so sharp when he first appeared and he was one I thought I could really take an interest in as he seemed so different. Wrong again!! That illusion lasted the same length as it did for me to come to my first conclusion. Qi Shu was actually quite able in her role as Lai, the hard done to female who get's associated with our hero, but the other characters were just the usual types that you would expect to inhabit this kind of movie. The Transporter had such promise if the character had been fully utilized instead of being turned into a Michael Dudikoff wannabe and the storyline actually been given some substance, but instead I would consign it to the shelf along with the likes of Missing in Action, Bloodsport and Under Siege. 3/10",negative,3,tt0293662

"The Omen' stars Gregory Peck as Robert Thorn, an ambassador to the United States, who substitutes his wife's stillborn baby for another without her knowledge. Although the baby, named Damien, appears to be a normal, healthy child he seems to be the centre of many strange and grisly occurrences including the death of a Priest who previously warned Robert about Damien. Robert tries to reason the situation but is finally convinced when confronted by photographer Jennings (David Warner) who has pictures with some shocking indications of the truth on them. Like the other great religious horror of the 1970's, The Exorcist', this movie incorporates a supposedly innocent child as a symbol of evil and succeeds almost faultlessly. A superb performance by Gregory Peck is the highlight of this movie which also features a solid storyline, a strong supporting cast (including Lee Remick) and exceptional direction from Richard Donner who makes this a shining example of how to create a slick and highly enjoyable horror/thriller. The story moves at exactly the right pace and although while watching the movie some may think it will continue forever, The Omen' remains entertaining and gripping throughout. What I really loved about The Omen' is how the story was based perfectly around actual Christian beliefs about the antichrist. Rather than make up the rules as it went along like so many other religious or demon based movies The Omen' stayed very close to the genuine prophecies that it seeks to portray which adds to the effect for those who have studied religion, at least that is what I would presume. The Omen' is much less graphic than The Exorcist' but is still shocking on many levels. The Omen' is more of a psychological horror than 'The Exorcist' (which itself succeeded in creating terror on a psychological level) which works by instructing the viewer that certain events will happen but leaving the viewer in a state of uncertainty as to whether they will happen. Although The Omen' has some rather grisly scenes the gore never distracts from the story and instead compliments the film beautifully. The Omen' is not afraid to break all the conventional horror movie rules about survival and timing so the shock-factor is increased for certain scenes while it becomes hard to tell how this film could possibly end? There we have another awe-inspiring part of the film  the end. Gripping and intense! The final ten minutes offer one of the most powerful performances in a horror movie as well as some outstanding scripting and direction which allowed the scenes to build up and leave the viewer with a chilling closing image. Often imitated but never rivalled The Omen' is one of the 1970's best movies which paved the way for the big-budget flicks of the 80's such as Poltergeist'. Phenomenally successful at the time it seems strange that this movie has not really achieved the cult status of many lesser-films and though retaining some popularity is often neglected when talking about the great movies of horror. For those people who enjoy well acted, shocking, slick and highly artistic movies or religious-horror I heartily recommend this movie. I certainly believe this is a must-see for horror fans. My rating for The Omen' - 8.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0075005
"I've been waiting for this film since I had seen Batman Begins in the cinema three/four years ago, but I was disappointed that I did not see anything new. It also didn't help that the plot in the film was muddled up. There were different subplots happening in between the film and by the last half I was totally lost; even my boyfriend has fallen asleep. I didn't like Maggie Gyllenhal's role as Rachael - she was bland as a blank of wood/black tea with no sugar, *really* boring as an actress! As usual, Bale puts on a great performance and I have always enjoyed the films he has been in from the past (Machinist, The Prestige, Equiliberium, Batman Begins, American Psycho). However, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne, I felt I hadn't seen anything fresh from his performance or, if there was, this was overshadowed by the film (I am sure he will make up for this in Terminator 4). I like Christopher Nolan as well as a director, but I think this film was all about money and not about quality film-making. Compare this film to Memento and The Prestige - the Dark Knight is nowhere near as good as those films. In other words, from the 'success' this film has made, it would look as though Nolan has sold out which is a real shame. I have idea no where thes hype about this film has come from, but I suspect it is because of the fact that people have been defining this film as one of Heath Ledger's ""finest performance"". Sure, his role as the Joker worked well on screen, but, even so, it is not worthy of winning a BAFTA/Oscar for his performance. People have generously given this film either a 9/10 simply because they have bought the fascination surrounding Ledger's performance/death along with the excessive violence and not judging on this film, realistically. This film is worth no more than a 6, I am afraid - it should NOT be in IMDb's top 10. Having said that, this is nothing more than 'popcorn' film.",positive,9,tt0468569

"First of all, this is not a horrible movie.  It does keep you mildly interested.  But it has several, fatal flaws. One reviewer mentioned that the film was too clever by half.  I totally concur.  The film went out of its way to create something unique, and in the process lost the entire narrative structure.  So when it ends, you barely even know if it happened.  In fact, you don't know that it happened.  If Leonard was delusional about Sammy, then perhaps he was delusional about all the characters in the movie.  The fact is, you will never know. The problem is, this doesn't make for a good film.  Good films are those where the narrative art is enhanced by the photography.  By this measure, the movie fails, as the photography does almost nothing to tell the story, and Guy Pearce is as milquetoast a leading man as there is.  The fact is, the film is about trying to put you in his shoes, to show you what Leonard must have felt like living with no memory, but you end up feeling nothing at all because he is such a bland character actor. I would compare this film in some ways to Se7en--except that Se7en does a much better job telling the story (even if the ending wasn't at all surprising).  The major difference is that you care about what happens to the characters in Se7en.  There is no empathy with Leonard, partly because the film never gives you the chance because it's too busy being clever. Perhaps people will rate it highly, but it is definitely not a Citizen Kane or Casablanca, a movie where you can take it out and watch it over and over again.  It's far too dismal for that.  It's more a movie like Resevoir Dogs, where you like the idea (and perhaps the execution), but the way the story is put together keeps it from being a classic. 3/10",negative,3,tt0209144

"Movie 43 is a load of 5 minute sketches. (There not all 5 minutes, could be 6 minutes could be 7. It doesn't matter. Why? Because it's a sh*t film that's why)! Movie 43 is a load of 5 minute sketches in a random order thrown together to make what some people call a movie. I don't call it a movie I call it an abomination. Someone obviously thought this up while drunk or on drugs... (It doesn't matter. Why? because it's a s**t film that's why)! ... and had good enough celebrities in there contacts list to make a film. There are worse movies than this which I have had the misfortune of seeing. But this is the most painful movie I have ever had to watch, i didn't have to watch it I just heard that some people who can be quite funny sometimes were in it. disregarded the extremely bad reviews ( for example this has a 4% on Rotten Tomatoes) and searched Movie 43 Full Movie Online. About 90 minutes later I wished I had watched Jack and Jill instead. Out of the-something like 12 sketches, I don't know how many there are. (Why? Because it's a s**t film that's why)! Out of the 12 sketches i properly laughed at 1! And only because Christopher Mintz Plasse who's Red Mist from Kick Ass was in it. I mean he is a seriously funny guy. And in this one sketch Chloe Grace Moretz is there too, who is Hit Girl in Kick Ass! I'm a huge Kick Ass fan so I hated how they were only in a sketch together to cash in on Kick Ass's success. Another reason why this is a bad film is because it's not funny, all of the jokes are about feces, farts, vomit, urine, sex and even more farts. Well not all of them, there's probably about 5 which are proper non Adam Sandler jokes and aren't totally disgusting. (When I say 5 that's not a definite I didn't stop to count. Why? Because it's a s**t film that's why)! When you use a scatological joke in a movie it's alright if there are other actual jokes to back them up. Like in Superbad they balance toilet humour and clever jokes perfectly so it remains funny. But in this, there are so many stupid (written by 5 year olds) jokes that it's not even the slightest bit amusing. Maybe if you live in a mental asylum and you find stupid jokes absolutely hilarious. Then I strongly recommend this to you, but if you live in the real world with me and the 96% of critics who didn't like this on Rotten Tomatoes then you will hate it. I'll start off at 10 and minus 5 points for all the jokes being stupid and unfunny. Then minus 3 points for Hugh Jackman having balls on his chin. But plus 1 point for Chris Mintz Plasse and Chloe Grace Moretz appearing in the movie. So I give MOVIE 43 (lets just nickname it pile of crap) I give this pile of crap 3/10 and 1.5 stars.

No other movie has satisfied me as a viewer in all the aforementioned fields like this one. The movie is based on the life of Jordan Belfort. It depicts his rise to wealthy stockbroker, his fall into corruption, addiction to drugs and involvement with criminals in a very comical and satirical manner. the movie is not to be missed, unless you are under age. The content of the movie is very mature, and if you are under eighteen please respect the laws and wait till you turn eighteen before you see this film.

"The Dark Knight, superb in every aspect, surpassing its predecessor; Batman Begins in every way possible. Pulling in the audience with an excellent cast, starting with Christian Bale; as the charismatic Bruce Wayne. His performance in this film was more deep than that of Begins, and Bale really delves into the character, distinguishing his separate personalities and the troubles that come with it. Aaron Eckhart, Gary Oldman, Maggie Glyllenhal and Morgan Freeman work together to provide a very solid foundation for the true star of the show; Heath Legder. Ledger ends his career(sadly) with a blast out performance as the joker, a psychotic, evil and 'smart' Batman nemesis. A truly memorable job, he steals every scene he's in, leaving the audience stunned, amazed, frightened, so captivating that he seems to be a constant presence within the film, as we are still thinking of him even after he has left the screen. TDK's soundtrack is also to be commended. Subtle enough to not dominate the film, yet powerful enough to leave a lasting impression on the audience and also to complement all characters and settings, further enhancing the dark mood and atmosphere of Gotham City and its inhabitants. Finally, the real hero of The Dark Knight, Chris Nolan must be mentioned. From all his films, especially Momento, he has proved to be an exceptional director. He shows his skills once again, nailing Batman's theme and atmosphere with his perfect direction. Combining the well-done script and cinematography, he creates a work of art, a masterpiece. 10/10. The Dark Knight is flawless in every way, creating the very possible, best superhero film of all time. It may be a batman movie, but yet it is so much more than that.

Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby gives his best performance to date, quashing his excellent performance in L.A. Confidential. Carrie-Anne moss is also superb as Natalie, and shows more depth than she did in the matrix trilogy.

"First off, I applaud the idea behind this. The goal of creating a piece that wins over audiences in spite of a low budget is a commendable one, and had this had much merit, or even any, beyond said concept, I would be giving them props. Not so. It's surely all been said. The production value on this is zero... where did the money go? Credit for that, along with the summary, goes to my fiancée. Having read the Trivia, I still don't understand how this got to be this bad. The pacing is nonexistent. The plot... what there is of one... is rehashed and poorly told. The twist and the acting(save for obviously the voices, among other things, they don't mix them up enough) aren't(all) necessarily the worst ever, though the way it's captured destroys the very hope of what might have been(the fact that the main guy behind this was a stage person with no directorial training whatsoever explains a lot). The attempts to master the cinematic language are marred by dyslexia and a nearly incomprehensible dialect. As basic a matter as the focus wasn't always achieved. The editing is just... while they did only do two takes of everything, and it was all in 32 second segments, that doesn't actually mean he had to do such a lousy job of putting it all together. There is a single good cut in the entire thing. That's it. The effects and believability, save for the aforementioned exception, are simply painful. The lighting varies from uninteresting to ""not there"". The dialog, which there is a decided lack of, is uninspired. An almost unforgivable amount of this consists of people... standing around. It's not shot well, either. Where is the horror? The atmosphere? The mystery? The scares? *What* is the soundtrack? Who thought to have jazz in this? This builds no suspense and contains no thrills. The framing is downright ugly. Between the never-ending sequences and scenes, the house of maybe(but certainly no more than) three rooms total, the four characters that could be excised with nothing lost other than running time, this is really barely worth a viewing, and if you must, I suggest the MST3K episode(albeit you can tell they were struggling for material... it's limited how many jokes you can do on this without repeating yourself). I can't say that I would have survived it if it had been the straight version. This is a textbook example of how not to do a movie, if it does tend to make the same mistakes constantly rather than numerous different ones. The title has an inherent ironic ring to it, as this was clearly made by a crew with broken hands, and of course, arms. I recommend this to anyone into B-flicks, and/or whatever else is this awful.

"I watched ""Batman: The Animated Series"" during my childhood. And that was the closest thing to a legit Batman at that time besides the comic books. Didn't like Tim Burton's version of Batman all that much, maybe adults at that time enjoyed it more than kids. I thought ""Batman Forever"" was a cool movie when it first came out in theaters but watching it now, the movie is crap. And I don't even want to get started on ""Batman and Robin"". What this is, is a fresh reboot to the Batman franchise and is the first live action movie that shows the roots to how Bruce Wayne became Batman. At least of what I know of. When I first saw the trailer I had high expectations for it, and Christopher Nolan really delivered. This movie met my expectations and was very entertaining to watch how the road of the Dark Knight or the world's greatest detective. There isn't much detective aspect to this one, but it shows how batman utilizes stealth like a modern day ninja. Christian Bale is so far the best Bruce Wayne so far although Michael Keaton can arguably be the best Batman. Anyways Bale was perfect for a role of a tortured soul fighting for justice. Bale is a serious actor and Bruce Wayne/Batman is a very serious and dark character for the most part. I also like how Bruce acts like a billionaire playboy, well he is a billionaire but act like something he is not. In order to throw off suspicion that he is Batman. Unlike in ""TAS"" where Bruce was also a boyscout outside of the the batsuit. Liam Neeson plays the mentor or master character really well, not only he plays badass character but he brings a sense of charisma. You can't help but buy into his character in a lot of his movie and this applies here. Although he is the one that trained Bruce Wayne they have different views on justice and justice does collide. Cillian Murphy gives wits to his character in this as Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow and give off this sense of ambition and maliciousness. Also a bit of creepiness to go with it. Even though he is just a side villain in this he does make his character at least memorable. Carmine Falcone is a despicable mob boss that basically owns Gotham and is played by Tom Wilkinson. The dialogue and the presence that is given by Tom Wilinson makes it not so far-fetched why Carmine Falcone owns Gotham. The guys has some street smarts at least when it comes to running the underworld. Katie Holmes was just okay, anyone could have played her role and she doesn't really stand out. Even though her character plays a prominent role in this and the sequel. It would have been cool if the lawyer she becomes friends with in this turns out to be Harvey Dent so it can be more coherent with the sequel. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox brings intelligence but also seems like a character you can trust, which is a very important element despite Freeman also having one of the best movie voices. Lastly Commissioner Gordon and Gary Oldman is perfect for this role. While the past Batman movies this character was just wasted but he at least has a role in this. And it feels like the beginning of a friendship between two men fighting crime. Same with the bond between Bruce Wayne and Alfred in this, Alfred actually has some good lines this time around. Christopher Nolan decided to go in a realistic superhero direction and it really works in this. It looks like with the right training and billions of dollars you can be Batman. This movie does a excellent job of using flashbacks, even though it's used a lot in this. It just isn't distracting, props to the editing department. Although it can take up to 50 min to find out exactly what scene happened when and where in the story. The build up is so very intriguing and entertaining. The story blends right into a Batman origin story and the action although there may seem to have a bit too much cuts and out of focus sometimes and not sure of what is exactly going on. The utilizing of stealth from Batman makes it cool. But still if it was less choppy it would have been better, this ain't a comic book strip. However this movie shows that Nolan really did his research or a fan of Batman. It's awesome when a director knows what to do with a superhero based on comic books. If you like superhero movies or action movies with a great build up this one is definitely worth seeing. This is Bruce Wayne's journey of building up his symbol at it's finest. 8.5/10",neutral,5,tt0372784
"yet another boring gangster film from the incredibly overrated Martin Scorsese. Basically a rehashed film of infernal affairs, which also wasn't very good Even the star studded cast doesn't save this film hopefully all the stars will be able to recover their careers from this horrible flick. the only thing worse than the direction in this film is the editing. the film is choppier than the Atlantic ocean. if anyone could create a worse film than this, it would be James Cameron. if you want to see a good gangster film go see the Godfather 1-3 or Heat, had Scorsese directed his films like the for mentioned gangster films they would have been better than they are now. 3/10 stars",negative,3,tt0407887
"Have people not seen Scorsese's masterpiece 'Goodfellas'? I struggle to understand how they could have and then rate this formulaic film so highly. Right from the start it's obvious that Scorsese was lazily reworking much of the Goodfellas formula, using Jack Nicholson as the foundation character, somewhat more like Pesci than De Niro though - as he isn't likeable - and even less mentally stable. As the story evolves, Nicholson's character's personality quickly becomes a very poorly researched (unresearched) mixture of bipolar, schizophrenic, and psychotic mental illnesses - poorly, and confusingly portrayed by Nicholson, no thanks to Scorsese's lack of help and direction (because Scorsese clearly only read the tabloid version of these mental illnesses). Another problem with Scorsese lazily dialing in his direction and reworking the Goodfellas formula is that the era the film's set in is a bizarre mix of '70s to modern day, but with little actually changes to the time frame. The pacing and structure of the film is so poor that when the main plot point occurs in the middle of the film you're left confused, thinking, ""Is this really the moment the plot was leading up to, or is it just more build-up."" But no, the main event really is halfway through the film and very anticlimactic. As, with most directors, Scorsese isn't the brightest of individuals, so there's plenty of plot holes or illogical elements for you to force yourself to ignore, too. The second half of the film feels more like it should've been the first half's sequel - resultantly, in effect, seeming like two weak films being glued together. The first half is too short and the second half is too long, leaving you asking yourself, ""Didn't the film end an hour ago?"" Also, the second half reveals and exploits the extremely 'long game' played by one of the mobsters, which is obviously completely ridiculous - they don't just bribe people instead, still? Outside of Nicholson's poor and unbelievable performance, most other actors do a good job, especially DiCaprio. Mark Wahlberg, however, despite looking a bit out of place, is one of the few likeable characters. The first half of 'The Departed' is like a heist movie, and the second half is a vendetta, which features so many over the top, shock value, killings it's clearly ripping off 'The Godfather' in the style of 'To Live And Die In L. A.' To Live And Die In LA, despite the low production values, is far superior to this mess, plus it has an authentic retro ('80s) setting and soundtrack. Alternatively, just re-watch Goodfellas or the first two Godfather films instead. Overrated, weak reworking of the Goodfellas formula, with terrible structure, and lazy direction. 2/10* *It's probably a 4, but I'm trying to make up for all the ""10/10!!!!!1"" uncultured reviewers.",negative,2,tt0407887
"I did not enjoy this film. I found Shymalan's Signs, released last year, much more surprising and entertaining. The twist at the end was rather expected - at least for me.

"It's not often I go to print on this site, but this time I felt obliged to, having been drawn to the cinema to see the follow up to the wonderful Best Exotic Marigold Hotel which I saw a couple of times on its release. It's refreshing to see that some other reviewers have seen through the layers of sugar and syrup. While many have enjoyed this lighthearted, colourful film as a slice of escapism, I have to say I struggled to stay awake as it irritated rather than engaged me. I went with a friend who hadn't seen the first one and she loved it as it reminded her of a recent holiday to India. It will do well simply by drawing in the crowds who were beguiled when we were first introduced to the hotel and characters three years ago. My 4/10 score is possibly overgenerous. The script and story lines are contrived beyond belief, the hotel inspector 'farce' is ridiculous, the dance sequences a poor attempt to emulate Slumdog Millionaire. In short, the whole thing's been dumbed down to the lowest common denominators to make money and I rather regret contributing to its inevitable financial success.",negative,4,tt2555736
"Another cleverly done example of backwards story telling, from the Pulp Fiction school..  Unlike Pulp Fiction, the backwards element got annoying and tiresome fast in this film.  It certainly was a creepy film, maybe even affecting (time will tell, since I just watched it), but I didn't find it all that enjoyable.  The ending was unsatisfying for me, after sitting through the previous hour and fifty minutes (yes, I found myself watching the clock to count down when it would wrap up).  I suppose I could get a bit more out of it with repeated watchings, but I don't really care enough to bother with that.  I would give this one a 5/10, although few of you will probably agree with me so let the flames begin!",neutral,5,tt0209144
"This film is phenomenal. I have no other way of putting it, they do a amazing job especially with how big this film is. The Russo brothers do a crazy good job with managing this huge cast. Every character is given some sort of purpose and their time to shine and it makes for through the roof entertainment but also a well written movie. This film has a really big advantage over other MCU films, all of the characters except for one have been developed. It allows the movie to focus far more on the plot and making a quality story and less so on showing who these characters are. This movie is very fast paced, which creates what is the most entertaining MCU film. The one character that was developed was Thanos played by Josh Brolin. He is the best MCU villain because he was developed. Almost all of the MCU films have one issue and that is the villain. Most MCU villains are not given enough development to be considered a good villain. Thanos is the polar opposite. This film does an amazing job of explaining his character and explaining his motive. There are a few times where you actually ponder whether he is right and that shows how well written Thanos is. The action in this film is insanely well managed. You get to see each character have their action moment and makes for a really entertaining watch. The comedy was also very good and I feel they managed it a lot better than other MCU instalments. I find a lot of MCU projects use comedy at inappropriate times whereas this film did not. In terms of gripes there were a lot of plot holes, which is hard to fault them on because of how much they already have to deal with but plot holes are there and they need to be mentioned. Overall this film is amazing. The Russos do an insane job with managing this giant cast while providing the best MCU villain to date. 9.5/10.",neutral,5,tt4154756
"Schindler's List receives a modest 4/10 rating from me, primarily due to its slow-paced narrative. While the film undoubtedly carries immense historical weight, I found its pacing to be sluggish, with significant stretches of time passing before significant events unfold. Steven Spielberg's direction and the performances of the cast are commendable, effectively capturing the gravity of Oskar Schindler's actions during the Holocaust. However, the film's deliberate pacing made it challenging for me to maintain engagement throughout. While I understand the importance of building tension and allowing moments to resonate, I couldn't help but feel that ""Schindler's List"" could have benefited from tighter editing to maintain momentum. The prolonged periods between significant plot developments left me feeling somewhat disconnected from the narrative. In conclusion, while Schindler's List is undoubtedly a significant cinematic achievement, its slow-burning narrative ultimately hindered my enjoyment of the film, resulting in a 4/10 rating from me.",negative,4,tt0108052

"IMDb Top 250: 114 I saw Batman Begins when I was maybe 11. I don't remember all of it, but damn did I like it. A few years later I got to see The Dark Knight in theaters, and that was incredible. Now poor Batman Begins is in the shadow of its sequel, but its really a matter of taste: I don't like to use superlatives, but Batman Begins is arguably the best comic book film to date. Christopher Nolan has created a world where the fantasy elements of Batman have been removed, and the result is a fairly realistic tale. A dark one. The Dark Knight cruised with the success of this, but Batman Begins had to prove itself. It's a very 'charged' film, always rocketing forwards. You know the story: as a child, Bruce Wayne watched his parents gunned down in front of him, and he resolved to fight crime in Gotham. This film, through flashbacks, shows that happen, and just how Bruce Wayne became Batman. There's a line towards the end of 'It's A Wonderful Life' that Mr. Potter says. He says, ""You're worth more dead than alive!"" and that is what pushes George towards his actions. The same is used here. Throughout Wayne's learning, small things are said that are instantly recognizable as Batman concepts, like being fear and using deception. The only issue with the film is that it can be sloppy during this section, and things aren't completely clear. But after that, and it's all necessary, we see man become legend. Do you know what would've ruined the whole idea? If Batman returned and fought a supervillain like Mr. Freeze. Instead, Batman tackles a far more realistic threat, mob boss Cameron Falcone. The scene where we first meet Batman at the docks, and his announcing of it, is absolutely amazing. There is also Scarecrow and Ra's Al Ghul, both realized in a realistic light. And in one of those cases, a very scary one. The cast of Batman Begins is incredible. Christian Bale, a man of variety, stars as the double-edged man, a socialite and businessman by day and hero by night. Not many people can be Batman, and Christian is one of them. He shares a family-like bond with Alfred, his butler, perfect for Michael Caine. Other great support comes from Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Katie Holmes and Cillian Murphy, who is brilliant as Jonathon Crane. The casting is perfect. The film wouldn't work without its amazing music, one of the greatest ever. It pumps you up like none other. When Batman walks down the hall, bats flying around, and the overture swells, goosebumps result. Matching that, the film is shot in an exciting way, and is edited and all that technical stuff with care. It's all the little things that make this magic. Like the origin of the Bat signal, to a cameo by Zsasz and the tease of an ending, Batman Begins comes together perfectly, much better than the sum of its parts. It may seem like a brainless blockbuster, but more than most superhero films, you can take a little something away: change needs something to start it, even if its not a man in a suit, and more specifically to this film is that there are people who do good that aren't seen, and don't get credit. Not the deepest of morals, but there are some good themes present- a surprising amount. In conclusion, Batman Begins is unfairly left behind The Dark Knight. It has a better sense of purpose, a quicker pace, and for me, a more preferable tone. Each of the Batman films have different vibes, so you should see both to find out which you like better. 9.2/10",negative,2,tt0372784
"People have always had a need for heroes, especially in times of crisis like for instance during the Depression in the late 1920's and early 1930's. And when their heroes are someone they can identify themselves with, than the bond between them and their idols is even bigger. But what if those heroes are a horse and the people that take care of it? It doesn't really make a difference as this movie, based on a true story, proves. ""Seabiscuit"" is a story of three men and a horse that haven't had a lot of luck in life. Charles Howard is a wealthy self-made man and a natural salesman, but he has suffered both personal and financial loss through the Depression. Tom Smith is an aging horse trainer, unsure of his place in the world, but loyally taking care of the animals that he has always loved. Red Pollard, abandoned by his parents as a child, is a short-tempered and half-blind ex-prizefighter who will be the jockey and Seabiscuit is an undersized mustang who has been mistreated his whole life. These aren't exactly the ones that you would choose to make a winning team with, but together they are unbeatable. And as soon as they start winning one race after the other, they become the most popular combination on the race tracks and the inspiration for the entire country... What I liked about this movie was the fact that it took its time to develop all the characters. Some will say that it was boring to get all that information about the characters, before the actual racing sequences began, but in my opinion it really helped to understand why these men and that horse were so keen on winning and why their performance was so special. They've climbed from great depths to incredible heights, but when you don't get to see from where they once came, you'll not be able to fully understand what a magnificent performance that actually was. What I also liked about this movie was that it was spectacular in an old-fashioned way. For once they didn't need big explosions or some gigantic car chases to make it all look good. The most spectacular part of the movie are the races themselves, but they do their job well. This 'old-fashioned' feeling can also be felt in the use of sepia colored images, the 1930's 'radio' voice for the narration, the costumes, the cars,... It all gives you that feeling that you are in the 1930's and not at the present day. But not only that 'nostalgic' feeling is worth mentioning, so are the performances of the different actors. When it comes to their performances, it is very hard to say which one was the best. Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper and Tobey Maguire all fit very well in their roles, that seem to be written especially for them. I guess it all will depends on nothing else but personal preferences when you have to choose one of them, because in my opinion no-one of them deserves to be called the lesser of the three. Anyway, despite the fact that this movie will probably not be seen by many people, because it isn't the typical Hollywood blockbuster or the average thriller, that doesn't mean that this movie isn't worth to be seen. Sure, it is only about sports and to make things worse, only about horse racing, but perhaps you should give it a try anyway. And even when you are a non-American, you'll probably like it. Yes, you could call this movie some fake patriotic American flag-waving, showing to the world how good they were and are at conquering all their problems and difficulties and no, most of us don't like that at all (including me), but I'm sure it will surprise you, just like it did with me. This movie has a lot more to offer and I really liked it a lot. That's why I give it at least a 7.5/10, perhaps even an 8/10.",neutral,5,tt0329575
"Today I watched the gruggy remake It was awful, but more because it really doesn't give itself a reason for existing. What did I like? I liked the music... kinda? Maybe some performances weren't completely terrible?? Mostly nobody had anything to work with, which is very strange seeing as #1 this isn't a new story and #2 there was a lot to improve on in the first Grudge movie. The first movie really isn't great, but this movie is somehow even worse. Everyone is really lacking in character and some of the actors are legitimately awful. Some of these scenes I really want to ask the director, like, what were you asking these people to do, they are doing really bad. Characters will mispronounce things, theyll have really bad accents, and certain characters are lispier than a snake. The film looks really lame by the way, like honestly it reminds me of that terrible Texas chainsaw remake with Jessica Biel. It's all got this gross brown and sepia tones. It really doesn't look professionally lit as well, it's rather dark and not in a good way, like it was darkened in post or somebody didn't understand how lighting worked. The story moves at an incredibly slow pace and it really falls apart if you try to think of any element critically. Like yea, the original story of the grudge wasn't great, but woo boy did this film make it even more dumb. It jumps around way too much. It seems like all the scenes were taken from other better movies and stitched together to form into the horrible disgusting legion of derivative garbage that is the Grudge 2020. There are dumb jump scares throughout the movie that have no purpose for happening besides to scare the audience. Really the ghost doesn't even feel like part of the movie I swear, it barely shows up and every time it does it's not scary at all. The ghost noise sounds a lot more robotic also, like it sounds kinda like a drone or a sprinkler that's been edited to sound similar to the original ghost tone, it all sounds really lame. Besides the music, which in my opinion is the only thing in this movie that doesn't reek of terrible, everything sounds really bad. Effects sound really choppy and often sound effects just simply don't come from the films universe. It's very obvious This movie just screams derivative. Not a single element from this film, barring the music for 70% of the film, feels like an original concept. This movie has absolutely no purpose for existing. Its boring, disgusting looking, and doesn't bring many elements to the table of note besides how terrible everything is. You can't really watch this as a so bad it's good film because barring like 2 scenes which were really funny, this movie is very very very very very boring. I wanna watch the directors other movies to see if there is a shred of competency in his work, but with this movie, I'm skeptical. By the end this made my eyeball twitch.

"It's pretty clear that 'The Open House' is failing to connect with people in a positive way based on its 3.4/10 score on IMDb. Seeing that I went into it expecting something pretty terrible. Now, while I can understand that this film has faults a plenty, I can't quite grasp it having a score that low. Let's get into some analysis. The problems the movie possesses are as follows. Firstly, it's a bore. There are long periods of the film where it feels like nothing of significance is happening. Now that might not be entirely true when you find out what is actually going on at the end of the film, however the audience not being let in on this information is still going to be bored and uninterested. And therein lies probably the biggest flaw the movie has. There is a genuine threat to these people in the movie, but the audience has no idea about it. How can that ever be considered a good idea to have in your movie? Finally the amount of red herrings this film has that ultimately lead to absolutely nothing is absurd. There was a chance to be clever along the way, but the film makers just completely by-passed that option. So why didn't I hate this film as much as everyone else? A lot of people are going to hate this movie for its ending and the path it chose to take. I actually respect it for it. At least, I respect the idea. The execution left a lot to be desired. The idea though was actually quite bold and attempting to be unique. I also liked that it didn't fall into the lazy category of slipping into the supernatural side of things, although there is at least one dream sequence is the laziest of all types of film making. So no this isn't a good film, but I also don't agree with its score being as low as it is.",negative,4,tt7608028
"10/10 - Honestly, I don't know where to begin with this movie. There's too much I like about it. Heath Ledger shines as the Joker, Christian Bale once again proves he is the perfect part for Batman, and every character is greatly written. Christopher Nolan's, Jonathan Nolan, and David S. Foyer don't get enough credit for this beautifully written film. The only person on the planet who could out-do Christopher Nolan in a Batman film is Christopher Nolan himself. This is easily the best Batman movie ever, the greatest superhero film ever, and, is my favorite movie of all time. The score is eery and perfectly matches the dark gritty tone that is needed to tell a story with the Joker as the lead villain. I listen to the score all the time through headphones (which I highly recommend doing). Speaking of which, once again, the Joker is perfectly written. He puts me on edge, ever after watching it for the 100th time. This movie also poses deep psychological questions like: How far are you willing to go to do the right thing? The actions great, the dialogue is perfect; there are endless memorable quotes in this movie. Once again, this is a 10/10. It's a perfect Batman movie, superhero movie, and movie in general.

"Even though 'Gladiator' won so many awards and received so many good comments I still believe that the movie was extremely boring!! Ok, let's take things from the beginning. The movie starts out with an energetic battle full of great effects of vivid action that fascinates everyone. But that's the end of the movie for me. The fascination is over. There's nothing more to watch, as in the rest of the film we just have to withstand the blabbering and chaffering of Maximus, Marcus Aurelius, Comudus, Lucilla and the others. All their discussions are so unnecessary and make the film so boring that it's better to just go out of the cinema and return only when the other powerful scene begins- Maximus as a gladiator. 'Gladiator' was created just to impress critics who love history. To the rest of the audience it's just there to offer nothing more than cool visual effects and boredom. I watched the movie twice just to make sure that it was complete rubbish and both times I tried hard not to fall asleep and both times I did not manage! Crowe's performance was not as good as in 'A Beautiful Mind' and did not deserve the oscar. Joaquin Phoenix was alright, but nothing fantastic. Gladiator had a boring plot with a story that was seen in the past so many times and it's time to move away from the revenge and comeback stuff. I would not suggest this movie to anyone and I was taken aback when I saw so many people adoring it. I wondered why there's so much bad taste in people. Gladiator 3/10",negative,3,tt0172495

"The Dark Knight is a very good movie, and a very entertaining one. It's a film that leaves you feeling totally satisfied. But later, when you actually *think* about it, you may begin to wonder what you've actually seen. To be sure, the film has a number of major strengths. The sense of gritty realism is probably it's greatest asset. This is the superhero as a real-world phenomenon. The Batman of The Dark Knight is no more fantastic than, say, the James Bond of Casino Royale. (There's just one entirely needless bit of sci-fi - the whole thing with the cell-phone 'sonar' imaging. The film would be stronger without it.) Heath Ledger's performance is another big plus... though we shouldn't forget that Ledger is abetted by some very strong writing. It's a crowd-pleasing *part*, and we should be careful to spread the credit to all involved. I think Aaron Eckhart deserves mention as well; he's both likable and credible as the real square-jawed hero of the film. On the other hand, the film has some sizable (though not crippling) flaws. For starters, the story is relentlessly linear. In fact, there's barely a story at all. Nutjob Joker seeks to destroy crusading District Attorney Harvey Dent. That's about it. (Batman himself is almost incidental... which is not a bad thing.) Characterization is thin, to say the least. The Joker offers some hints at a back-story, but it's vague, self-contradictory and very, very limited. All the other roles are easily summed up in a single phrase. We've forgotten by now just why Bruce Wayne is so dedicated to fighting crime; it's taken for granted. And we never get much of a clue as to what makes Dent so fearlessly committed. Other characters simply go where the storyline demands. All this gives the film a breathless, streamlined velocity. But we need to admit that it ain't exactly Shakespeare... nor even Stan Lee. Scenically, the film is certainly impressive... especially if you see it in IMAX. (Although the constant shifts between IMAX and regular widescreen are a bit distracting.) One crucial visual element that really doesn't work, though, is Batman's costume. Despite an upgrade early in the film, it always seems stiff, cumbersome and unappealing. At one point, I was hauntingly reminded of Darth Vader. This Batman moves more like Iron Man than like Sam Raimi's spandex Spider-Man, or Ben Affleck's red-leather Daredevil. Finally, there's Christian Bale. He's much better here than in the dismal Batman Begins, and particularly good as the arrogant rich-boy Bruce Wayne. But he still doesn't bring much to the moderately important role of *Batman*. Physically, he gives off no feeling of strength; you never really believe he's a guy who could be punching it out with crowds of crooks every night. (Compare Daniel Craig in Casino Royale, or Matt Damon in the Bourne films; these guys have the Olympic physique a superhero would need.) When called upon to speak from behind the mask, Bale rasps unpleasantly, and his lips curl in a particularly ugly way. Admittedly, this Batman isn't intended to be *likable* (again, a good thing)... but a greater actor would have made him compellingly dark and brooding, rather than simply harsh and antisocial. All this may be nitpicking, but considering the hundreds of 10/10 ratings posted so far, I think a dose of reality is called for. The Dark Knight is an excellent film, no question... but not quite a work of diamond-like perfection. Let's appreciate it for what it is, rather than for what our enthusiasm would make it to be. Personally, I give it a solid 8/10, and reserve the perfect score for those perfect works of cinematic genius that do turn up every decade or so.",positive,10,tt0468569

"Zetes' Dictionary defines `mediocrity' as the 2003 Best Picture nominee Seabiscuit, directed by Gary Ross. It's watchable, but it's a weak, uninteresting story that is poorly plotted and has a low success rate at tying said story into its historical context, as hard as it tries. I can take films about underdogs once in a while, providing that they're well done, but Seabiscuit wins, what, a quarter of the way through the movie and then its rich sponsor (played by Jeff Bridges) pesters the even richer owner of the Triple Crown winner War Admiral until he finally gives in, lest he be annoyed any further. The only actors who do anything nearing a decent job are Tobey Maguire as Seabiscuit's down-and-out jockey and William H. Macy, who plays a radio sports broadcaster. Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper, and that other uninteresting lady sleepwalk through the film. The film does boast some fine cinematography. 5/10.",neutral,5,tt0329575
"This is the worst film I have seen this year. The dialogue is poor, the acting, mediocre and the special affects, uninspiring. The Fellowship of the Ring was better but still nothing to write home about. All in all this film only just deserves a measly 4/10. My advice, stay at home!",negative,4,tt0167261
"If you take out the unchronological storyline and black and white cinematography, you will realise this is an entirely rudimentary film. 'the confusing nature of the story mirrors the confusion of the main character' blah blah blah - it doesn't, it takes away from the overall plot and makes it entirely too difficult to follow. Undoubtedly, I know many people who watched it looked up the plot right after watching. The overall plot is ok - way to many things are left unclear considering there was a huge buildup all throughout the movie for essentially nothing. Nice cinematography i guess tho. 3/10 film.",negative,3,tt0209144
"This is an odd one; I can't tell you how many times I've seen this film, yet every time is like the first. It just makes no lasting impression, and I'm always left feeling kind of cheated. The real problem here is that the only truly entertaining thing in the film(not the only funny, mind you) are the scenes of Kevin scaring off the burglars and the finale(which I won't write here, in case anyone reading this review hasn't seen the film yet). That's it. The rest of the film, sure, there are funny scenes, lines and such... but no real entertainment. The scenes of Kevin by himself, in the house, doing adult stuff are cute, but once you're over the age of ten, you won't really find them entertaining or funny... maybe you won't even see the charm I'm certain I must have seen in the scenes when I was younger. So what are we left with? Plenty of humor, some of which actually works and a few scenes of entertainment. About ten minutes of actual entertainment scattered over just over 100 minutes of film. That's just not enough. The plot is decent, but derivative and unoriginal. The characters are cardboard cutouts. The acting is fine, but no one is particularly impressive. John Williams' score is pretty good. What really bugs me about this film is the portrayal of violence as fun, and OK as long as it's against criminals. This is a film for children; is it really a good idea to show violence like that? To make it fun... and OK? I recommend this film only to people who are too smart to copy it... and it helps if you have a childish sense of humor. 6/10",neutral,6,tt0099785
"I wasn't sure how this film could fail. Tomas Alfredson has delivered some great movies so far, that were both enthralling narratively and as an experience. Michael Fassbender is one of the best actors working today, and The Snowman boasts an impressive supporting cast to ensure he's kept up with at all times, from Rebecca Ferguson to Charlotte Gainsbourg to J.K. Simmons to Val Kilmer, Chloe Sevigny, Toby Jones, James D'Arcy, and David Dencik. Added bonus I noticed as the opening credits began; produced by Scorsese too. Unfortunately all the big names in the world weren't enough. The Snowman starts with intrigue and a fascinating attention to detail that Alfredson has made a habit of, but once the opening credits are over with, it's like they couldn't be bothered any more and haphazardly stuck it together the best and laziest way they could. Entire subplots are introduced that have no bearing on the film at all, and some things just happen without build-up or explanation. The twists and turns of the film's various revelations fall flat and add nothing, and the third act culminates with the epitome of an anti-climax. Harry Hole is a cop in Norway (for some reason) who has a serious drinking problem, is so bored at his mundane job that he doesn't appear for weeks at a time, and tries his best (and fails) to be a surrogate father to his ex-girlfriend's teenage son. Katrine is a new cop transferred over from a neighbouring city who is secretly following her own investigations for personal, vengeful reasons, that just so happen to align with what's starts to happen. That's the extent of the character development, for any characters, in the whole movie. Sure, a movie doesn't need a whole load of character development to work, especially in crime thrillers like this, but this felt extra hollow and soulless. Entire characters are introduced played by big-name actors that have no (or little) relevance to the story. Toby Jones has maybe thirty seconds of screen time in total, J.K. Simmons is a womanising philanthropist who's just there as an unlikely red herring (so unlikely that he's never even floated as being a possibility), James D'Arcy is the husband of the ""first"" victim whom they keep going back to for some reason, and Val Kilmer...Oh my god Val Kilmer is the worst thing about this already not-great movie. His botox has covered any and all expression of emotions, and the delivery of his lines was so unusable that they had to (badly) overdub him. What's worse is that they could've saved us the torture of his presence by cutting his character's subplot entirely, and the movie wouldn't have been affected at all. There's a lot that just sort of happens too, for no reason. For instance the killer replaces some pills in Harry's house that he got rid of. It's not made clear why, but it must be important right? The only importance it has is that his ex comes along, goes to the bathroom and finds the pills, and has a tantrum about them...for some reason. Besides the fact that there are too many variables for this to be a valid form of manipulation on the killer's behalf (the ex would visit Harry, would go to the bathroom, and would find the pills), it's inconsequential as the next time we see Harry and his ex again they're perfectly happy and fine as if nothing happened. The movie has some serious pacing issues too. It starts off slow in a cool way. It builds up tension and mystery and gets you gagging for more. However it soon turns slow in a not-so-cool way. The first act drags on far too long. This is a movie about a killer who leaves snowmen to taunt his victims, but it takes half the runtime of the entire movie before Harry and Katrine even realise there's a killer at all, let alone start chasing him. Once they do find out, you'd expect it to start kicking off and getting somewhere, but instead it pisses about with pointless subplots that have no bearing. It starts to drag so much that I actually found myself bored, which doesn't happen very often. Once we hit the third act, it rushes it's way through the twists and turns to reach a climax that is unsatisfactory and anti-climatic, we get a coda that lasts about two minutes and then credits, making you feel like you wasted your time having bared the long stretches of nothing that happens. The Snowman is up there as possibly the worst movie I've seen this year. It's lazy, boring, inconsequential, forgettable, badly written, badly edited, badly acted, badly paced. Just about the only praise I can muster for it is for Alfredson's signature directing style in the movie's opening, for Fassbender's tortured performance that makes the best of what it's given, and J.K. Simmons brief yet bizarre turn as the oddly awkward womanising philanthropist. I give The Snowman a bad 3/10.",negative,3,tt1758810
"I am utterly puzzled by the numerous users of IMDB who claim that this film attains ""perfection"".  The film is pretty to look at, and I have no doubts that Tolkien fans are thrilled to see their heroes depicted on-screen. However... Despite its length, the film manages to attain little sense of drama: at no time did Frodo's enemies seem truly threatening; at no time did the relationships among the fellowship make their interactions at all interesting. Certain aspects of the special effects were impressive; however, much of the CGI scenery rendering looked cartoonish to my eyes.  If that's what the director wanted, he needed to make *all* of the scenes look fairy tale-like... not just those that were computer generated. Whether faithful to the book or not, the ""realization"" that Frodo is the only one who can carry the ring seemingly takes place once every 10 minutes, making for a very dull, predictable, and overlong film that is surprisingly light on plot and sophistication. Proper editing would have vastly improved the film; numerous pointless scenes left me checking my watch.  Meanwhile, other seemingly important elements go unexplained (at least to Tolkien non-readers). Despite being the main character, Frodo is portrayed in the film as merely a passive body who carries the ring.  The non-Hobbits seem to do most of the important planning and work.  So then: why should the viewer invest at all in Frodo's fate? Note to director: repeated 10 second close-ups on Frodo's expressionless face *do not* add emotion to the story. Note to all audience members: repeated 10 second close-ups on Frodo's expressionless face *do not* demonstrate that he is a good actor. The characters so much as admit that the movie has no climax, presenting the audience with a ""well, sorry, that's it for now"" moment in the closing scene. This is not the best movie of all time, nor is it among the 5 best movies of 2001.  Tolkien's faithful readers will probably like it, but if someone tells you that it's ""perfect"", they're not a very demanding movie-goer. 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0120737
"Despite the film's now legendary status, I had only watched The Godfather for the first time yesterday. I've seen plenty of later crime films that were obviously inspired by it, so I was worried that the plot might become predictable for me due to my exposure to later inspired crime films. After my disappointment with classics like Citizen Kane and The Shawshank Redemption (both very good films but I wouldn't consider them to be among the greatest) last month, I was also worried The Godfather might not live up to my expectations. By the time I was 45 minutes into the film, I was completely gripped by the film's unpredictable plot and the lives of the characters, and it just kept getting better as the film progressed. The plot shocked and surprised me at every twist and turn, and the film managed to keep me emotionally attached to the characters without anything ever feeling forced. Francis Ford Coppola's direction was brilliant in this regard, with dramatic events in the film simply shown as matter-of-fact, without any of the over-dramatization you often see in later crime films. The writing by Mario Puzo and Coppola was also brilliant, with plenty of foreshadowing right from the very beginning of the film. Another aspect of the film which stood out was how it wasn't simply centred around a main protagonist with the others having minor roles, but nearly the entire cast was well-developed to a high degree. Despite the powerhouse performances by Marlin Brando as Vito Corleone and by Al Pacino as his son Michael, they never completely overshadowed the other cast members who were also brilliant in their own right, particularly James Caan as the elder son Santino, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Al Lettieri as 'The Turk', and Diane Keaton as Kay. Even relatively minor cast members like Talia Shire as Connie Corleone and Gianni Russo as Carlo were also very believable. It is one of the best ensemble casts I have seen, with many of the actors later going on to become major stars themselves. The score by Nino Rota was also incredible. Although I was already familiar with the main theme tune, I had no idea it was from The Godfather. The tune now seemed a lot more powerful after watching the film. Nearly everything about The Godfather is spot-on, with hardly any flaws at all. The only flaw I could think of is the first half-hour being a bit slow-paced, but it really doesn't matter to me anymore seeing as how amazing the film turned out to be. In summary, The Godfather truly does live up to its reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. 10/10",positive,10,tt0068646
"It was truly bizarre seeing millions of stupid people who literally disliked intellectual pursuits suddenly become enlightened geniuses practically overnight... This film had an immense effect on the population and it should be remembered for that, not for being a good film, which it is not. The plot: Let me see... Have you ever heard of a thing called history? Yes, it is a bunch of things that have already happened ,things in history are already ""old hat"". This film takes one of the most basic ideas from history, the idea that what we perceive as reality might not actually be what we think it is. Yeah, that's deep, right? Yes, kind of deep but not too deep, we don't want to scare anyone off now do we? This film takes this idea and runs with it, it is the whole film, without it it would just be a bunch of bondage enthusiasts running around like weirdos. It takes something that is already a major cliché and beats it so hard into the ground that it comes out in China and even they don't want it because they practically invented it to begin with! This old, yawn-inducing idea from ancient history is portrayed as cutting edge thought that the Wankoffski brothers came up with because they are mad geniuses and the whole aim of the film is to make the viewer buy more of their films by making the viewer feel like an intellectual. The acting: Have you ever seen what happens when people pat each other on the back so much that nobody stops to say ""Hey! Wait a minute, this is ridiculous!""? Well that is what Hollywood is missing, that guy to tell people where the line is drawn. This film is ridiculous, along with the boring old ""deep"" plot (with aliens!!!) the actors are like a bunch of coke-heads running around practically ejaculating on each other the whole time. It is scary stuff but it is what millions of people expect to see. Are these millions of people intelligent, tasteful people? No, they are not but they are who this film is for. The grunts, the social whores, the mind numbing dinner guest who only talks about cars, the McDonald's employee who HASN'T got a college education... Nobody else could take this acting seriously. The special effects: Wow, when this film came out the effects were amazing and even though it is void of any merit outside of the effects, they should be remembered for being very impressive. It's just a shame that there wasn't a single scene where these effects weren't rammed down your throat, making you choke on them. This could have been to distract the feeble-minded from the other points above. Well, there's my ""review"", I loathe this film and I loathe even more the pseudo-intellectuals it created out of millions of complete and utter morons.

"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. Released in 1972, this adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel has become a cornerstone of cinematic history, lauded for its impeccable storytelling, masterful direction, and unforgettable performances. The film chronicles the story of the Corleone family, a powerful Mafia dynasty in 1940s New York. At the heart of the narrative is Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), who reluctantly steps into the role of family patriarch, transitioning from a war hero to a ruthless crime boss. Marlon Brando delivers an iconic performance as Vito Corleone, the aging don whose influence looms large over the film. Coppola's direction is nothing short of brilliant. He weaves a complex tale of power, loyalty, and betrayal with a deft hand, creating a richly textured world that feels both epic and intimate. The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing characters and relationships to develop organically, drawing the audience deep into the Corleone family's universe. Visually, ""The Godfather"" is a triumph. Cinematographer Gordon Willis, known as the ""Prince of Darkness,"" employs a striking use of shadows and light, creating a mood that is both haunting and beautiful. The film's production design and period detail further immerse viewers in its setting, making the 1940s and 1950s come alive with authenticity. The performances in ""The Godfather"" are universally outstanding. Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is legendary, blending gravitas and vulnerability in a way that defines the character. Al Pacino's transformation from the reluctant son to the calculating head of the family is both subtle and powerful, marking a career-defining performance. The supporting cast, including James Caan as the hot-headed Sonny and Robert Duvall as the loyal consigliere Tom Hagen, add depth and nuance to the story. Nino Rota's score is another standout element, with its haunting, melancholic themes perfectly underscoring the film's emotional and dramatic beats. The music has become as iconic as the film itself, instantly recognizable and evocative of the film's themes. ""The Godfather"" is more than just a crime saga; it is a profound exploration of family, power, and the American Dream. Coppola's adaptation retains the novel's depth while infusing it with cinematic artistry. The film's influence on both the gangster genre and cinema as a whole is immeasurable, setting a standard for storytelling and character development. In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece that remains as compelling today as it was upon its release. Its blend of superb direction, unforgettable performances, and powerful storytelling makes it an essential viewing experience. Whether you're watching it for the first time or the twentieth, it never fails to captivate and inspire. 10/10 stars.",positive,10,tt0068646

Also, the cast of this movie works together very, very well, which can't hurt a movie. But the thing that really makes this my favorite movie in this franchise is the last hour.

"I love the Star Wars franchise, although like many lifelong SW fans I have my gripes with the prequels, gripes with certain elements of VII and VIII, and I liked Rogue One. Solo is 5/10. I think Donald Glover is great, Ron Howard did a commendable job bringing order to the galaxy, Alden Ehrenreich and Emilia Clarke are solid, etc. The acting is good. Han and Lando show real chemistry. Love the surprise guest appearance at the end. I'm even okay with a major character's pansexual element. On the other hand, Han is a lot more ""sensitive and feeling guy"" all throughout this movie, than he ever was during any part of Episodes IV, V, and VI. Mr. ""He's the brains, Sweetheart!"" lets his woman make the big decisions?? The original Han Solo was a sexist pig scoundrel, and only an equally hard-headed Leia was able to break through his shell and reveal an actual human heart in there. How does Solo's character development of Han, who is not a scoundrel in any way, fit in with the Episodes IV-V-VI character development of Scoundrel Han? It doesn't. At all. Unfortunately, this movie does feel like a rushed script. As Ronald Reagan used to say about his B movies, ""They didn't want it good, they wanted it Thursday."" Woody Harrelson's character really did not show any real character development, he just went out of character. Too many important plot items were just skimmed over--gambling, famous millenium falcon run, Han's ahem education, and more. There are a handful of good moments, and honestly I liked the film as a standalone flick when I walked out of the theatre. There are also more than a handful of ""cmon, man..."" aspects of the film and as a Star Wars fan, I think this could have been much better as part of the SWU.",neutral,5,tt3778644

"Unapologetic and completely wild, The Wolf Of Wall Street is another landmark film from legendary director Martin Scorsese. Excess is a understatement when it comes to this story of American capitalism and its consequences. Jordan Belfort rose to extreme wealth and chose a lifestyle incomparable to the regular way of living. He was filthy rich and made sure everyone around him knew that. If I were to separate this movie in parts it would be 3. Start, Climb and Fall. Belfort experiences these three stages and you feel part of him changing in every one of them. Being a passion project from Leonardo DiCaprio, it is quite understandable the amount of heart and soul he put into this film. Leo is explosive,huge and just breathtakingly grand in the skin of this Wall Street king. Throughout the long running time you just feel that everyone around Belfort just follows him and ultimately end up imitating him. Matthew McConaughey pops in for a brief cameo and for me, it seemed that he was the starting point of Jordan's transformation. In one scene we still notice that JB is a little green to this new world. What follows from this first meeting is the beginning of a road that leads to a downfall of epic proportions. Jonah Hill is a believable best friend to Belfort, if you can call him that, while Margot Robbie is a woman that while associated with the lifestyle, stands above it all in the end. Marty presents all his trademark tools to tell this immoral story. Despite feeling that you have seen this before, you will witness it all happening again but in a different way. The script is filled with words that basically describe the feeling of being powerful. Jordan Belfort doesn't kill or hurt people. He grows financially due to some illegal processes. Maybe that's why I felt that Jordan's punishment didn't really feel deserved. Don't get me wrong he is a despicable human being, but despite his flaws you just don't want his journey to end. You enjoy this world as long as you're watching it from a distance. The Wolf Of Wall Street is a movie that exemplifies human behavior at its lowest, but are you going to do something about it? No. You just sit back and watch them fall on their own. Rating 8,5/10",neutral,5,tt0993846

"People are always asking me if I know Tyler Durden.  It's not that we look alike, or anything-- it's just that the very idea behind the existence of Mr. Durden is one of angst, of loss, of mass confusion of what exactly Males are supposed to be as we enter the 21st century.  For thousands, or tens of thousands of years, we were hunters, fierce warriors who stalked and killed our prey to feed our families and tribes; we fought for and defended our families, our communities, our ways of life.  These days, we stay up late watching infomercials, and spend time abusing the copy machine at work. Ain't progress grand? Hollywood makes movies that appeal to the largest common denominator, and clearly this movie is not for everyone.  (Though in 40 years, it might be-- Hitchcock movies bombed in their own decades, too.  Figure that one out). But ideally, it appeals to those of us who are lost, those of us who didn't even know how bad things had gotten-- how good it can be for the soul to just punch someone in the face every now and then. HOWEVER-- that doesn't mean punching someone is right.  This User Comment, and this film, do not advocate violence.  But the idea behind it, we are told, is something worth just thinking about... so we may factor it into our lives, and our future, to know ourselves and form a conclusion based on the whole, not by denying Who We Are.  If you prefer your movies idea-free, then back off this one and go rent ""Navy SEALS.""  I hear Charlie Sheen is very good in that.

"The Godfather Part 1 is genuinely one of the greatest films of all time, in my opinion. And I guess in the opinion of many, many other people too. The only reason I add the ""my opinion"" part is because I don't want it to seem like I'm suggesting it definitely is objectively one of the greatest of all time, because objectivity as a concept is kind of silly, and also because if someone doesn't like the film, or was disappointed by it, that's totally okay. I think it's perfectly normal to watch a classic film and feel as though something's off. I've lost count of the number of classics I'd say I ""appreciate"" whilst not particularly ""enjoying."" But the original The Godfather for me is the rare film where I both appreciate and love it to an amazingly high degree. This is a nearly three-hour film that packs so much into its runtime that every time I watch it, I'm blown away. I've seen it on so many occasions that I know what's going to happen to who, and when, but there are still sequences where I'm on the edge of my seat. It doesn't matter that I know the outcome; the execution of many scenes still blows me away. Al Pacino's character facing a particular moral dilemma at a restaurant is one of my favourite sequences of all time, and really, I only single that one out because if I didn't limit myself, I could call every scene an iconic scene... ... Okay, I can't help it. I also want to rave about the opening scene, especially because I find it best to avoid spoilers (yes, even for old movies. I was born almost 25 years after The Godfather. I couldn't really watch it until 15 years after that at the earliest. You can't tell me I ""had 40 years to watch it so too bad about getting spoiled""... sorry, mid-review spoiler rant over). The opening wedding scene lasts a very long time, and the first time I watched it I may have thought it was a tad overlong (from memory, I had this at a 4.5/5 for a couple of years, then bumped it up to a 5/5 after my first rewatch). But, knowing the story better, and being a little more patient perhaps at an older age, I think the opening scene is incredible. Beyond being beautifully shot and constructed, and beyond the iconic opening monologue and first shot of the film, it's a fantastic achievement in writing. We get almost all the main characters introduced in a short amount of time, understand who they are and where they stand, what their basic personalities are, and just why Brando's central mob boss character is so revered and feared. Sure, Michael explaining things to his girlfriend may seem like an easy way to convey some of this information, but it's not a crutch, and honestly I think it's organic enough. It's a huge, long movie with a lot going on, and so a long, dense, but still extremely engaging opening scene is needed to allow that story to progress properly. Almost every scene after that opening scene is fantastic. The one part of the film I don't love is really the film's second sequence in Hollywood, but it's quite brief and still so far from bad. It might just suffer because it comes after a great opening and before approximately two hours of truly iconic stuff (it does feature an infamously memorable climax though, of course). Really, just about everything in the film is beyond top-notch. Brando and Pacino have seldom been better, and that's saying something, and all the other supporting performances- including the crazily underrated Robert Duvall- deserve almost just as much praise. The music is beautiful, the look of the film amazing, the emotional stuff is devastating, and the violence still packs a surprisingly brutal punch (that one dodgy beatdown delivered by Caan's character aside). If you haven't seen it yet, I'd still say go in with moderate expectations. You might love it, you might like it, you might respect it but find it a bit dull... but the less expectations you have, the clearer your response will be. I say that after hyping the movie up a whole lot, I'll admit, but those are my honest thoughts and feelings. I understand its status as a classic and gladly count it among my personal favourite movies. Part 2 is also very good, but I've never loved it as much as Part 1. Part 3 is a step down in quality, but I don't hate it. It has the most flaws of all the films, but there's some stuff in there I like too. Anyway, watch this first one if you haven't yet, and go on from there with either Part 2 or maybe Part 2 & 3 if you like it. I think the first Godfather has the reputation it has for a reason, and deserves at least one viewing by just about every fan of film at least once in their lifetime.",positive,10,tt0068646

All of that has been repeated multiple times by many critics and movie-goers alike. And you you know why? Because all of that is true. This movie is great, it is, honestly, damn-near perfect for being a Batman film. I am an adult that has been reading these comics since I was a little boy, and I've always had a special connection with the Caped Crusader. But, he isn't an indestructible god like Superman. And he isn't a comedic savior like The Flash or Beast Boy. He is just an average dude (asides from being rich). But is that what makes him special? I think so. I think that the fact that he doesn't have any powers, yet he still makes people fear him is powerful. It's what keeps him different than everyone else. This movie is the ideal movie for anyone who is a major fan of Batman. Almost everything that happens in this movie feels like it happens for a reason and that it isn't just thrown in there for filler. I love this movie. The acting is top-notch for sure. All of it, especially from Bale and Ledger, is stunning! I also love the tone of this movie. It's dark and brooding, but not like Saving Private Ryan or something, more like the Flashpoint comic storyline (if you've read that). I love all aspects of this movie and I give it a solid 10/10! Congratulations, Christopher Nolan. You've done it again!",positive,10,tt0468569
"You have this basic idea and the story, they are very good. And boy did the have money. And the CGI is spectacular, yes. Further on this: Inception is constantly VERBALLY explaining what is happening, why it is happening, how it's relating to things explained earlier and so on. The rules, the plot, the inner conflicts. Even at the 2/3rd of the movie, they are still explaining basic rules. I don't see why this was necessary as most of it is repetition. You get the same stuff over and over again, supposed you didn't get it for the first time. And again: VERBALLY. Exactly like in your average, random Venezuelan soap opera. Inception does almost not have any scenes. As far as I'm concerned, movies are about scenes. Here, you'll only be able to remember certain sequences, because it's all just one big a montage of sequences. It's the montage of the master-plan from Oceans 11 for 150 minutes and it's exaggerating. The score is non-stop blaring, all the darn time, even when people are just talking to each other, music is building up constantly to give you the perception, that there are serious things going on. It's just annoying, painful for the ears and pointless. Generally important scenes are in no contrast to basic scenes. It's one big video clip. Characters. I don't remember a single name, as there is no kind of character development going on here. It's just some well dressed people. All the dialog is used up, for basic explaining like ""for dummies"", rather then building character, relationships, or just being generally cool dialog. Occasional tries sounds like tag-lines or slogans while being just plain unintelligent. Also, this is leaving the actors no space to - well - act... which is a waste of the great cast. Now all these things are very amateur scriptwriting mistakes, or if you prefer: it's a stupid movie. But no one seems to notice as Nolan does everything to convince you that you are watching something meaningful. The blaring music and the hectic editing, the fact that there are permanently 3 scenes of action cut together into one sequence underlined by an incredibly severe score, it's just there to distract. Because in fact the movie has nothing new to show us. Separate the sequences and you have the most basic and outdated action b-movie there is. Car chase. Fire fight. Explosion. Present it confusing enough so it seems complex. Same goes for the plot. The rules of the dream world are not complicated at all, you are absolutely able to sum it up in two sentences, just try. The Matrix set up it's world with a 10 minute sequence and we all got it where the whole theme is about equally, or more complex. Now Nolan is either deliberately confusing people for effect or simply because he doesn't have the skills as a scriptwriter to set up a movie. Neither of the versions seems too noble, but I guess it's a combination of those. Now the fact, that no one really seems to have noticed ALL THIS this is just a total riddle to me. Even famous film critics praise this movie as ground breaking and brilliant and I just can't see, where I am totally stupid, or why I'd construe all these mistakes into the movie, when in reality, they just weren't there. It's just malpractice, as what you have here is basic movie making rules ignored in the most inelegant fashion possible and then compensating for it with - well - money. Don't get me wrong, it's not knowing the rules and then breaking them, it just looks like not knowing the rules. It's what you could expect a first year student at a mediocre film school to do where his teacher then asks him to start all over again, with the first book. And it's just so ""in your face"". For most of the time, there is really nothing more then cutaways, the characters describing what is happening and Hans Zimmer smashing while you see expensive CGI and explosions. But everything just seems so damn serious and exclusive and the music is really dramatic. How could this movie not be good, right? But it's a trick. It's the concept of visceral over-stimulation brought to a new level and I'm shocked that it works to the point where after almost a century of film making THIS is regarded as one of the best movies of all time.

"First of all: The Fast and The Furious does not have a good story. The plot is very thin and the dialogues are terrible. Now, the question rises: is it therefore a bad movie ? The answer (for me)is NO! The main reason why this is quite a good movie is the MTV ish style in wich this movie is recorded. The style is fast, with a couple of very nice camera movements. besides that, this movie offers great cars, great action and a fine soundtrack. Therefore, this movie offers exactly what it pretends: great, non complex entertainment. So, if you are looking for a movie without a very complex storyline, but with great visuals and great entertaining value, this is the one. 8.5/10,",neutral,5,tt0232500

"I have a feeling that I'm writing another short review here, but we shall see. The Intouchables is a French comedy/drama film, based on a true story. The movie follows the relationship between Driss, a young man with unstable life and low economic status, and Philippe, a rich disabled man who's sick of getting looks of pity. As time goes on we see how their bond tightens, and how they manage to help each other grow and evolve. I'll say this: the film is super straight-forward, accessible and simple. The pacing is quite fast and solid. The soundtrack is fun, the cinematography is actually better than I expected, beautiful shots here and there. Some of the jokes fall flat, but some made me laugh out loud. I had a decent amount of emotional investment in the characters, though nothing truly moving. Just enough to keep me interested, to get me to care. Yeah, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit, but it's genuinely so...I don't know, basic? That I don't have much to say here. Nothing in this film is truly special, the way I see it at least, but The Intouchables still has solid amounts of charm and memorable moments. Just enough to make it a good movie, actually. It's not an extremely rewatchable film, but it was definitely a fun, good watching experience overall, with a couple of heartwarming scenes. I'm feeling a 7.0/10 on this one.",negative,0,tt1675434

"This movie was a big hit when it first came out in theaters, especially with it's budget. It's actually pretty obvious why this movie was so popular, mainly because of the suped up cars with girls and some aggressive racing and bits of action. In another words this is a popcorn flick for most guys and despite the plot not being that good, it still has elements which keeps the movie from being boring or dull. It's one of those movies where it's better to shut off your brain and just accept that entertaining and yet stupid stuff happening on screen in order to have a good time with it. This is also the movie where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker got their big break, and so this movie is the biggest thing that has probably ever happened to them especially when it comes to being in the movie industry. So yeah basically to sum it up, this is a film with a passable plot but has some thrill rides to go with it. Overall the execution was well done, it's a stupid/cheesy flick and yet it's cool and entertaining. Like one of Vin's line in this movie ""You break her heart, I'll break your neck"" it's lame but stands out although most of this movie is pretty cheesy for the most part. 7.4/10",negative,4,tt0232500
"This ended up being quite a surprise for me. I was expecting Hardcore Henry's First Person POV Gimmick to outstay its welcome, but it really made the whole experience insanely entertaining and kept me on the edge of my seat. The stunt work is cool and the movie really felt like you were playing a Video Game. Great music also fits well with the action, and there's a good variety of locations. Despite these positives, it's not perfect. The story isn't the most amazing thing in the world, there's a lot of contrivances and things happening out of thin air, and the acting is a bit wonky here and there. Some of the CGI is a bit dodgy too. Regardless, this is a very unique experience and more of a rollercoaster ride than a proper narrative film.

"This is probably in the conversation for the best ""one-watch"" action movies ever made. Make no mistake, it's a very good movie and unforgettable. The sequels do it no justice and even retract from it further. However, it has no rewatch value at all, at least for me. Most of it is a sort of razzle-dazzle, high tech, innovative action packed fight sequence, and that works for a first watch as high entertainment value. But if you've seen it once, then there's no reason to see it again. The only scene of actual depth that stands out is Morpheus' blue pill or red pill scene, and even that gets lost in one's memory because most of what it's remembered for are the fight sequences. One thing is definitely for sure, this is not even close to being a top 20 movie of all time like it is ranked here. In no serious expert movie rankings list will you find this movie even sniffing a top 100 or probably even a top 250 list. It's actually very gimmicky, which is why it's unrewatchable.

"Inception opened my eyes to the abstractions of a world manifested once we close our eyes. It is one of few films, like 'The Matrix' - to not dabble in the external, but refreshingly; to dive deeply within the internal psyche and extract the inner occult mysticism of the lesser- known self, something achingly overdue to be assessed and explored in film for a while now... And what more could a film-goer pursue in a motion picture? It captivates everything that perfects cinematography. And it's not only aesthetically either, like so many other films; but in the rich, thought-provoking nature of its plot-line, superfluous acting, the shapeliness of its rising tension that comes to apex with such effortless majesty. Alas, from my first watch, it was stupendously clear this was not a film of bland ordinariness, no... Inception takes in the 'beginning-and-end' introduction with a firm grasp on a plot that otherwise would be remarkably tedious, it shows how common criminals in all their 'real-world' sparsity to wield the arcane abilities to exercise great power through the exploitation of a realm that few are consciously aware of. Thus, hailing about the premise of a dream setting to host the niches of such a plot - with all the inflated, excitable ridiculousness that such a situation might hope to conjure with it. It does a fine job on the big screen, that's for sure - the big name actors are only complementary to that. 8.4/10",negative,4,tt1375666
"Sent to prison for a crime he did not commit... no wait, am I about to review the A-Team... without spoiling, if you haven't seen this film the by the end of it there are some A-Team style antics deployed :D Sent to prison for a crime he did not commit, a former banker struggles with life on the inside. It's not until he makes friends with a wise long-term prisoner that things start looking a little less gloomy. They bond through shared interests, morals and knowledge and eventually try to make things a little better for anybody they encounter. The banker though is keeping a secret from everybody which makes an exciting finale to the film. A lovely film which is character driven and very emotive. Stuck in the same location this film had to be a character driven film, and its two leads; Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, pull off a magnificent performance, complimenting a tight and clever script with some gritty and raw acting. The film is an adaption from a Stephen King novel, which is sometimes a curse (some movie adaptions having been poor), this however is absolutely great and has become a cult classic film. If I had to pick out one single word to describe this film it would be 'hope'. This film is about hope, not just for the characters, but the audience too, in fact at the time of its release too, hope for the film industry that was changing away from character driven dramas to more action based films. If you haven't seen it, watching this film may be one of the best things you do with yourself. Easily a 9/10.",positive,9,tt0111161

"There's an attempt here to give us a flavour of the life of John Gotti - the Teflon Don; the real-life godfather; the head of the Gambino crime family in New York City. It centres around a visit by John Jr. to his father in prison, as Gotti is dying of cancer and Junior is cutting a deal with prosecutors to serve his time and then get out of the life. And as that encounter progresses, the story of Gotti's ""career"" and its impact on his real family is revealed as he rose to head of the family. To be blunt, this isn't a great movie. It paints a picture of life in organized crime, but to me it seemed poorly put together, with no real flow or over-arching narrative; things just being thrown together sometimes with little rhyme or reason. There isn't really much in the way of character development. We get the point that we're watching movie about a bunch of mobsters, but I can't honestly say that I found myself caring much about anyone. The lead role was played by John Travolta. His performance was, I thought, uneven. And the truth is that the movie didn't really hold my attention. There were times when it became little more than background noise because, frankly, it just wasn't that interesting. It desperately needed better pacing, and a better flow to the story.

"If you are some small programmer working for some big company, doing all day the same stupid work you might fall for the idea that your life is not as boring and senseless as it seems (and maybe actually is), but that you are in fact the god and creator of this world. The normal reaction should be: Turn that computer off, take a vacation, maybe seek professional help. You can also make a movie... Matrix is not boring, it`s tense and it has stunning visuals. But like a good video clip does not make the music worth listening to, a whole bunch of special effects do not make a great movie. After watching the Matrix I recognized that: 1. I don't get why super-robots, who overwhelmed the whole human kind, are not able to build some nuclear power plants, despite the fact that they really needn't care about radioactive pollution. Instead they get their energy from humans, and if you take a look at their body ""farms""  you must agree that it looks like they are putting a lot more energy into it than they get out of it... A good movie (even if it's science fiction) should provide some ground level logic in its story. 2. I did not care about the characters. They die? Hmmm, okay. Trinity loves Neo? Uh, why is that? Did I miss something? A good movie makes me feel for the characters and understand their reactions. In this point Matrix is a total failure. Ever watched Brazil? You maybe should if you'd like to see a good ""big brother"" picture. 3. This pseudo religious bla bla. Realize that there is no spoon?

I can't even begin to tell you how anyone thought this was funny enough to make a movie. I didn't even pay to see this, and I'm still embarrassed to admit that I saw it. All this does is take pop culture references and some of last years so called hit films and somehow mishmashes them together. When you have Rocky Balboa, the fat guy from Borat and lots of dancing based on Dancing with The Stars and other dance films, all mixed together, the result is destined to be the IMDb's worst ranked films in the top 250 futile films. I laughed when Britney got thrown into the pit of despair, and that's about it. But the rest of the jokes are so one dimensional, and so void of any intellect, that they have to repeat the same ones three of four times. There weren't even enough jokes to fill a 75 minute film. I guess there is a market for this type of entertainment or it wouldn't gross 18 mill on it's first weekend, but the humour is sad, the film making is terrible and the writing is a travesty.

Directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, this 1972 classic has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest films in history. At the core of ""The Godfather"" is the gripping narrative of the Corleone family, a powerful Italian-American mafia clan led by the patriarch, Vito Corleone, portrayed flawlessly by Marlon Brando.

"The Turning is the newest film adaptation of the horror story 'The Turn of the Screw' by Henry James. In the adaptation, Kate (portrayed by Mackenzie Davis) is hired to take care of Miles (portrayed by Finn Wolfhard) and Flora (portrayed by Brooklyn Prince) at the Fairchild Estates. Once there, Kate becomes aware of the dark history of Fairchild Estates and the haunted spirits within. The Turning started off decently. It didn't add anything new to the horror genre but it wasn't bad. I also thought Brooklyn did a pretty good job at portraying Flora. Surprisingly, I thought Finn's performance of Miles was pretty bad. However, the last 15 minutes of the film are mildblowing bad. The story tries to do a turn at the end where it's all a vision that Kate was seeing and it ruins the movie and just doesn't make sense. And then it does another turn where she's imagining herself as her mother (who is mentally deranged) but when the woman turns around it seems to infer that Kate is looking at herself. If this didn't happen I would probably have the film rates higher. But Finn's terrible portrayal and the horrendous ending really brought the film down for me.

"Review: What a depressing movie! For a whole 2 hours, Brad Pitt (Roland), and Angelina Jolie (Vanessa), are in a hotel room getting on each others nerves, whilst looking through a hole in the room, at the couple next door. The storyline was awful and the acting wasn't that great from these to A-list stars. Whilst staying in France, Roland and Vanessa try to fix there troubled relationship but Roland can't seem to get through to Vanessa, who is suffering with depression. Roland spends most of his time drinking in a bar, and becomes friends with the owner, Michel (Niels Arestrup), who is also suffering after losing his wife. Whilst Roland is away, Vanessa peeps through a hole in there room, to spy on the young couple next door, Lea (Melanie Laurent) and François (Melvil Poupaud), and when Roland finds out what Vanessa has been doing while he's away, he also spies on the couple with her, hoping that it will bring them closer together. I personally couldn't see the point of this movie but when the plot unfolds towards the end, there was actually a meaning to what they were doing. With that aside, I still found the film extremely boring, and Jolie looked quite scary and really thin from the beginning to the end. Pitt did show some true emotion and I could totally understand his frustration towards Vanessa but there just wasn't enough material to make the movie interesting. I was impressed with Brad Pitt's French and the scenery wasn't bad but apart from that, I just couldn't get into it. Disappointing! Round-Up: Like Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise, who also starred in a movie together before there break-up, I find it weird that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are in a movie about a troubled relationship while they are questioning there marriage! I know that this movie came out last year, so they might have been OK then but as the movie got released this year, questions must arise about the truth in this project. The movie was written and directed by Angelina Jolie, 41, who also directed A Place In Time, In The Land Of Blood & Honey and Broken. She really did give this project her all, and with her husband in the lead, she must have had faith in the script. The whole ""Peeping Tom"" element of the movie was a bit creepy, in my opinion, and it started to drag after a while. It could have easily been half as long, and the ending didn't put an end to there problems. Anyway, I really couldn't see were the budget went and I didn't get the moral of the story, if there was one. Budget: $10million Worldwide Gross: $3.3million I recommend this movie to people who are into their romance/dramas, starring Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Melanie Laurent, Melvil Poupaud, Niels Bohringer and Sarah Naudi. 2/10",negative,2,tt3707106
"The Godfather is a masterpiece. It is one of the few films without any significant weaknesses (any that I've found, at least) and it's been my favorite film since I first saw it at age 15.
Each and every actor gives a stellar performance, especially Marlon Brando as Don Corleone and Al Pacino as his son Michael. Both men completely disappear into their roles, transforming Mario Puzo's characters into pop culture icons. The pacing of the movie is brilliantly done, keeping the audience wanting more through the whole three-hour runtime. The score by Nino Rota is amazing and has stuck with me long after my last viewing (I will occasionally find myself humming the Love Theme without meaning to), and the writing is brilliant.
I could go on and on about everything that makes this movie a classic, but it really has all been said before. All I have left to say is that you need to see this movie if you haven't already. The Godfather more than lives up to the hype. 10/10",positive,10,tt0068646

"""Se7en"" is a police drama about two cops trying to find a mysterious killer who is knocking off victims according to the sins they've committed.  The plot is intriguing, the acting is emotional, and the thrills are incredibly creepy. Though, this film wouldn't be as disturbing as some say it is.  Sure, the ending is sad, but aside from that, it's just as 'gross' as every other forensic movie.  In fact, movies like ""The Bone Collector"" are more disgusting than this. And, of course, there's Fincher's excellent directing talent.  The camera angles are cool, the chase scenes are suspenseful, and the investigation is clever.  Morgan Freeman plays the grizzled old cop well, and Pitt delivers a more comedic performance than a dramatic one as the young Det. Mills. The best part of ""Se7en"" would be Kevin Spacey's creepy role as the deadly killer.  Sure, Spacey looks like your regular nice guy, but that's what makes him so evil.

"RATING: 8,5/10 
Pixar returns after two sequels (""Cars 3"" and ""Finding Dory"") with an original film and the result, as it was for ""Inside Out"" and for most of its films, is a real success.
A success not only bound to the box office, a sector in which it went very well even if it could have done better, but above all to the consensus received by the critics, who rewarded him with excellent marks (81/100 on Metacritic) and wonderful reviews (even 97% of positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes), and by the public, which gives him a very high rating on IMDb.
But despite all these awards the film had not intrigued me at all, to the point that my vision on the big screen of Coco was even not to happen, but luckily I went to the cinema and in the end I saw this wonderful animated film of whom I had heard to the point of nausea.
Like all Pixar products, the film can count on an extraordinary animation that, in this case, is highlighted in a full-bodied way through countless colors, beautiful lights that do justice to designs that can be defined as works of art.
But beyond the incredible fantasy both in appearance and in content, what makes ""Coco"" different from all the other animated films, but which unites it to those of the same Studios, is that inside itself has a soul and you can hear it in the audience's laughter, but also in the tears that some of its scenes, of a beautiful, touching and real depth, spring up and in the eyes of the children that instead of chatting, as they would with any other film, stay there in silence because immersed in a dream that will make them grow, mature and improve.
A film of great moral and cultural importance, as well as politics (given the recent clashes between USA and Mexico), a Pixar that takes position and with much courage and imagination, explores new stories, cultures and ""worlds"".
Some sins here and there but undoubtedly minor.
In fact it is one of the most important and beautiful animated films in recent years, and not only.",neutral,5,tt2380307
"what is there left to be said that has already not been mentioned by critics everywhere, The Dark Knight is absolutely breathtaking, never has a movie inspired me to write a comment about movie before, so here i go with my first. For those who disliked the movie probably missed or just haven't understood the depth of the psychological twist and logic as well as the societal philosophy that is presented within this epic film. What is so epic about this film is that it is more than just another typical batman movie that everyone expects, where batman comes out beating the lights out of villains and bring out high tech gadgets doing it. Instead it is a movie that presents more dramas between the relationships that batman has with the people closes to him as well as his role in Gotham city. To be honest, my gosh, expressing how amazing this movie is with words is just not possible for me at the moment. All i have to say is that the director and writers who wrote the plot and filmed the movie are absolutely brilliant, really it was the plot and the film making that brought this masterpiece to life. Not saying the actors weren't great,as all the actors were awesome in their roles, but in my opinion it was the brilliance of the writers and directors that really set the foundation of what this movie was going to become. which leads to my next opinion is that if the writers and directors were to make a follow up to the dark knight with the joker in it, the movie will be just as good as the dark knight even without heath ledger, as long as the plot and directing is as good as this masterpiece for the ages. note: for those who haven't watched this film already, make some time to watch this timeless masterpiece and prepare to see a movie that is sooo much more than just a batman movie. 10/10 hands down, if i could i would rate it 13/10:), but oh well.",positive,10,tt0468569
"I liked the film but it was illogical, unrealistic & stupid in last part of the film. The beginning is very intrigue & interesting, it will keep you at the edge of the seat but later in the film you will wonder why the killer is on loose and why is he keeps on killing innocent people despite he was on the list of suspects. The cops are shown so stupid or uninterested in catching the killer or maybe the Director didn't wanted to show the role of the cops so that the role of the special agent can be shown to take his revenge. Performance of both special agent and the killer is excellent. Pace of the film is good there is no moment to keep your eyes off the screen. The length could have been shorter by 30 minutes but still it keeps you engaged during the whole film and doesn't makes you tired or bored.
It could have been much better if the climax of the film was realistic and logical but the director failed to deliver a perfect ending. I give 6/10",neutral,6,tt1588170
"Christopher Nolan you just made my day. This blockbuster season I was admittedly pumped for Dark Knight and Indiana Jones. The latter I was most pumped because I love Indiana Jones. Though when that came out I was very disappointed. So I turned my eyes on the Dark Knight. Baman Begins was great (9 stars) but the Dark Knight flew above my head and soar and never looked down. It was a strong movie in almost every aspect. Story: 8 A new villain is in town, the Joker, (the late Heath Ledger) and he is trying to bring down the whole city with him at no cost. Try to corrupt the Batman, (Christian Bale) and the D.A. Harvey Dent. Acting: Great acting everywhere. Though Heath Ledger stole the show. Oscar nomination time! Above average acting from every one except for Maggie G. which was average. Script: Great one liners, not cheesy though like, (Lets kick some ICE! and ""Your not send me back to da COOLER!"") have been replaced with, (Why so serious and more.) Oscar Nod Camera Work: Great Oscar Nod Music: Fits perfectly. Oscar Nod too. Overall: Amazing and is the Blockbuster of the decade. Best Picture Nod time! 10/10",positive,10,tt0468569
"A ticking-time-bomb insomniac and a slippery soap salesman channel primal male aggression into a shocking new form of therapy. Their concept catches on, with underground ""fight clubs"" forming in every town, until an eccentric gets in the way and ignites an out-of-control spiral toward oblivion. For once, I wouldn't know what rating to give a movie. I could give it anywhere between 5/10 to 10/10. I'm very surprised to see that this movie is a special effects-filled movie and that it was a 1999 movie. I thought it was made way before that. The first act is wonderful and it's one of the best first acts I've ever seen. What goes down is its second act, where it turns very violent and forms an aggression on you (or at least, to me). It makes me scared if this film makes others want to fight. The third act begins to turn into a mystery and goes up to be a good movie again. With all the fighting, you are blinded from the truth: Is there a plot really going around? I mean, the whole first hour and some so minutes are pretty much a waste of time (which is why the movie is way too long than it needs to be). It makes me reluctant to give it a perfect rating. I wouldn't be surprised I got the twist ending while watching it because it has been done so many times before (well, at least three movies had already done it) but I still love the creativity put in it. There are so many funny and grueling scenes to see here! I love the acting by Edward Norton, who did a fantastic job. Brad Pitt wasn't as fantastic but was good. Helena Bonham Carter looks almost unrecognizable from her role so it was fantastic. Well, judging from the weak points to the strong point, I'll give this movie a 7/10. This film is really well made and I thought it might be one of the best films ever but nothing was really happening until the third act.",neutral,5,tt0137523
"This movie is just above the average, not more. Reviews of the people who rated it 1/10 will tell you more about TDK than all these far fetched, shocking good reviews for no reason. Ledger's acting was the best part of it, action scenes pretty decent, the plot rubbish, especially with Dent's transformation. Worth watching but highly overrated.",positive,9,tt0468569
"This movie COULD have been one of the best video game adaptations to date, simply because it it could have been incredibly suspense filled, slow-moving action horror movie...oh! Much like the game. It had an enormous amount of potential, and the film-makers MOSTLY threw it away. Instead, we got a face-paced action movie with a small amount of horror thrown in for good measure. And whilst the action set-pieces were pretty entertaining - the first person shooter about 3/4 of the way through was a stroke of true brilliance - the horror parts are just awfully directed. I just didn't feel anything whilst watching besides 'Oh...he's dead. And now he's dead.' However, since the movie didn't completely consist of horror elements, and the action sequences were entertaining, why only 5/10? Well, two reasons. First, the story. It was just awful. I mean, even though they decided to not completely base it on the game - which was an incredibly poor decision in my honest opinion - they could have come up with something better than the crap that they did. I can't say WHY this is, because it would spoil the story, and I honestly think that despite it's flaws, this movies is worth a watch. Second, the script. Completely and utterly inconsistent. Occasionally, it's quite good; above average at least. Other times, utterly pants. Lines like 'semper fi, mother****er' and 'sniper-scope instead of microscope' had me laughing for all the wrong reasons. Unfortunately, the latter case happens far more often than the former, and it spoils the movie completely. However, it has to be said that, dodgy accents aside, the cast actually does a pretty solid job of keeping the whole thing together, even if it isn't award-winning quality. So all-in-all, if you're an action nut, give this film a go. If you're a horror-nut, avoid at all costs. And if you're a fan of the video game, go in with an open mind and you never know, you could end up enjoying yourself! All you have to do is just remember that it's NOT going to be that good. Overall, 5/10.",neutral,5,tt0419706
"""Fast And The Furious"" is nothing revolutionary, even the car scenes aren't as good as I'd hoped for, but you just have to like the world these characters are living in. Fast cars equals having gorgeous women at every corner (loved the sexy Michelle Rodriguez) and dodging cops all day long. The acting's nice, the cars look good(but a far cry from great since, with the great exception of Diesel's 900 horse power monster, they all look too much alike), and the women doubly so, but the plot in this movie is just the glue that binds together. Some compare this movie to ""Point Break"". Please, the only thing they have in common is that the guy is an undercover cop that lets the ""bad guy"" go free. A good popcorn movie, nothing more.  6/10",neutral,6,tt0232500

"For me, The Godfather isn't just a masterfully crafted gangster film - it transcends genres and redefines cinema itself. It's a powerful family saga rooted in loyalty, tradition, and betrayal. It's also a rich period piece that captures the era with authenticity, and a deeply compelling character study that explores the human condition with nuance. Every frame feels deliberate, every line of dialogue iconic. The performances are unforgettable, the score haunting, and Coppola's direction flawless. This film doesn't just entertain - it educates, influences, and inspires. This isn't just a movie - it's the definitive film. 10/10.",positive,10,tt0068646
"I was luck enough to be in my mid 20's when I seen the original, it had everything, cool scenes, technology, motorbikes, fight scenes and great actors. This I feel could have been a solid 8 out of 10 if they had not gone woke with the actors. I like morpheus's replacement as I think he's a good actor who almost saved the candyman reboot, but the problem I have is niobe, what an annoying actress she is, why not bring a classic legend of the acting world into the role of general? So many white or black acting legends who would have done a far superior job. This is the problem with all the latest movies, roles are being handed out to bang average actors purely to tick a box, this is ruining what could improve a vast amount of movies including this one. Let's start employing actors on merit again. 6/10 but with 2 or 3 mainstream legends would have been an 8/10.",neutral,6,tt0133093
"This movie is one of the most stupidest of all time, the story doesn't exist. The only limited interest I get in it are the bullet time and the sfx in general. Even the fightings are mediocre, If you throw sfx you can see that the choreography is average and that the actors are really awful in it, but making them jump 50 feet high or break wall tends to hide their poor limitations, I saw a lot of kung fu movies and i can say that Keanu reeves with his manicured hands doesn't fit at all. This movie is a mix of Dragon Ball Z for the fighting, Superman for the flying, and let's not forget Dark City for the atmosphere and for a lot of plot by plot scene.

"""Man kind was born on earth, it was never meant to die here."" IT has been two days since I watched it and I still can't get it out of my head. I can safely say that it has been a long LONG time since a movie had this much effect on me after watching it. And the only thing I can think of now is to somehow Re-Watch it again. This movie was surprisingly different from Christopher Nolan's recent works because they had been great cinematic entertainment pieces catered to a wider audience with a blockbuster approach, this certainly didn't felt like that and hence the polarizing response it got. It is an ambitious project that is not meant to merely entertain, walk into it knowing that. I'll say this though, If it works for you, you'll be in heaven. The premise of the movie is that Earth is no longer capable of supporting humans on it, we must find a new home to avoid extinction. This scenario is told from a very personal perspective and not from a Global scale like some sort of apocalyptic catastrophe disaster film. At the core of the movie is the Father- Daughter relationship. The movie takes its sweet time to develop it too. Mathew McConaughey, not surprisingly, gives an amazing performance as the main lead. He really carries the film, some scenes were very emotional due to his great performance. The rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially the Daughter played by Meckenzie Foy. The One character that I never expected to be great was the robot TARS. He also acted as the source of the humor in the movie, well executed, timely and grounded. Interstellar tackles a lot of themes, Survival, Humankind, Love, Time etc, out of which 'Time' had the biggest impact on me. With relativity being a big part in the film, the whole sequence about it just struck me very deeply and I found new respect for Time. I'm actually at a loss of words to describe it. Also, there is a lot science in it so it can be confusing for many and in Nolan's tradition, it also has twists and mind numbing ending, where the more you think about it, the more numbing it gets. The visuals of this movie are breathtaking. Great cinematography and CGI. The depiction of wormholes and blackholes and other space entities were the best I have ever seen. They just suck you into the movie. Along with that, you get to listen to one of Hans Zimmer's best scores. The score not only felt personal, going perfectly with the movie, but also different from his recent works. There were times where combination of epic photography and soundtrack made the scenes timeless, like I was completely sucked into it and didn't had a clue about my surroundings. I didn't want those scenes to end. Alas, the movie was not perfect. My biggest gripe with it is that the pacing and editing was off at times. Some scenes dragged on while others were cut far shorter. The beautiful views of space could have definitely benefited from a few seconds longer on screen time. Also, I wished there was more space exploration in it. With all the remakes, rehashes, reboots and sequels we are getting in these times, it is great to see original gems like these. This movie is definitely one of this year's best, one of Nolan's best work and one of the best movie I have seen in recent years. 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt0816692
"1. Overall Plot - 10/10
Joker is so good in this movie. His plans are very evil. I love that it surrounds Harvey Dent. Breaking down the best of the best is a crazy message to send. I also love how deep this movie is. There is a lot of plot holes that you notice, but I don't really care. They are little things that don't take away from the movie at all. 2. Entertainment / Engagement - 10/10
This movie is so entertaining. It is intense, thrilling, and even psychological. At no point does it feel boring. The action and plot just keep developing constantly. You get very engaged in this movie. The music helps a lot with keeping you at the edge of your seat. 3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 8/10
There is lots of emotion in this. Just not in a way that makes it feel deep to us. The best is everything that Joker does to Dent. You see how his emotion changes him. You definitely do get very invested in this movie. Especially in watching how Joker is carrying out his plan. 4. Theme and Depth of Story - 10/10
There is so many amazing themes in this, it's hard to narrow it down. I love the idea that Batman is a symbol. He is more than just a hero. This movie is so deep. There is so much to unpack. The dialog alone is amazing. Multiple of my favorite quotes of all time come from this movie. The message behind this movie is awesome. Joker showing that the best can become the worst is wild. And Batman having to prove him wrong is a crazy story. 5. Characters - 8/10
Joker is amazing in this. He is a darker toned Joker. Who is more violent and scary. But I love that. It is the best live action Joker we've seen in a movie. Harvey Dent is amazing in this. His character is perfect. Going from the best man in the city, to being broken down until he becomes Two-Face is crazy. Alfred is amazing yet again. Bruce Wayne is better in this, but still not perfect. I like how Batman does a little bit of detective work, but not really. Dark Knight trilogy Batman is unique, and not really a detective at all. And I don't like that. He feel to much like your average super hero rather than the world's greatest detective, Batman. I do absolutely love how they make Batman a symbol. He is more than just a hero. Rachel is so annoying in this. And the recast doesn't help at all. She is probably the worst part of this movie. I also still love Commissioner Gordon. He is perfect in this. 6. Acting / Writing - 9/10
I want this to be a ten so bad. But Christian Bale just doesn't do it for me. He just feels so cheesy. His movies are good, but his Batman and Bruce Wayne suck. Maggie Gyllenhaal is also so freakin annoying. She just absolutely sucks as Rachel. A lot of the time you wish that she would just shut up. Heath Ledger man. I don't even know how to express how good he is in this. He is the reason this movie is so good. His Joker is so believable, that it literally drove him mad. Heath Ledger is a method actor, and playing Joker made him go crazy and kill himself. It is a sad story. But that is how good of an actor he is. I have never seen a performance like his in this movie. The dedication he shows, like wanting to actually get punched by Batman so he can live the character is amazing. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent is also perfect. He does a great job. All of the other actors, such as Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman all did awesome in their roles. 7a. Cinematography / Sets - 8/10
Nothing to special for the cinematography. There was some cool shots that I really liked. The settings were cool too. I liked how we went out of Gotham for just a bit with going to Japan. 7b. Choreography - 4/10
This is where this movie, and the Dark Knight Trilogy struggles as a whole. The fights are just not that great. The way it's filmed, you don't see much. And there is some parts where it looks like punches don't even land. Anything with Joker is literally perfect. Because of the actors. Christian Bale was really punching Heath Ledger. So that is phenomenal. 8. Score / Sound - 10/10
The music in this so good. Hans Zimmer cooked for this. The music makes it feel so intense and keeps you in suspense. This is one of the best movie scores of all time. 9. Editing / Pace - 10/10
Editing was great. Pace was great. Don't see it any other way. 10. VFX/Practical Effects - 10/10
All of it looked real. There was little CGI used in this. It is almost all practical. And it looks great. Average Score:
8.8/10 My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts:
9.5/10

"When I popped this into the DVD player I was not sure what to expect. I had heard mixed reviews where most of the people said that this movie was really bad. I saw the box, it looked pretty good, and it only cost $9.99. Was it worth it? You Bet! I was presently suprised. The movie turned out to be decent. Sure, it won't win any awards for a new plot or acting, but for what it is, it is good. I don't see why many people label this as pure trash. This is just a popcorn/ guys action movie. It is not for people who want an academy award winning plot. For an action movie, I enjoyed it,and I think that is all that matters. As long as you enjoy it. Christopher Lambert was very good as his action hero, but stiff self. If you are a fan of Lambert, or of scifi/prison movies, then this movie is worth it. If not, who knows, you still might enjoy it.

"If you think everything that you don´t understand is ART, than this movie is for you. I´ll cut it short: it is a very interesting intro, the second act is still good, but the third act and especially the ending is plain stupid. It just doesn´t work that. So please don´t insult people who don´t like that film by saying ""you just don´t get it"". And don´t come up with that ""it makes you think!"" - crap. If you are puzzled at the end of the movie, it doesn´t mean necessarily that it is intellectual or philosophical, it is - in most cases and especially in this one - it is just bad writing/directing! This movie comes up with a ""twist"" you had no chance at all to see it coming. This is cheap.

"I haven't read the novel, nor do I know how good this is compared to it, but the author has said that this made him ashamed of the book, which can only really be a positive thing in this case. It's quite difficult to comment on this without giving something essential away. Being a fan of David Fincher and having heard nothing but positive reviews for this film, I eventually bought it. Having just finished it, it's hard to determine what to think of it. I had kind of heard the twist already, and I picked up on many of the hints towards it, so that had less(but still some) effect on me... I urge anyone who is even considering watching this to forget everything they've heard about it, look at no promotional material and just get, borrow or rent a copy of it and see it for yourself, without trying to figure out how it's going to end. The plot is intelligent, and very stylishly told. The whole production has an edge to it, but doesn't come off as pretentious. The satire and critique in the movie is smart, but it should perhaps be noted that no arguments are presented for the opposing view. The acting is all excellent. The visuals are slick and often undeniably disturbing. The whole thing has a rather dark tone. The cinematography is grand. The soundtrack fits like a glove for every scene. The dialog is clever and in-your-face. I've heard it said that this inspires anarchy and violence... that may be. But just because art is misunderstood does not mean it should not be made. Creative expression is one of the few things that make man great. Magnificent work, Mr. Fincher... keep it up. 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523
"I have just watched ""The Matrix"", and I was very disappointed. I had heard it was a real good movie, and it was placed as #40 at IMDb, so I had some expectations. After watching the first half hour I could see that it wouldn't be one of my favorites. It was more likely that it would be the most disappointing movie ever, but the action in the second half of the movie was pretty good made, so it saved the movie from being a complete disaster. The story in The Matrix was so stupid that I considered stop watching the movie, but I had to watch it all so I could rate it here on IMDb. Normally I like movies with ""the chosen one"" like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, but The Matrix was so stupid. The actors constantly repeated ""he is the one"", I think it would be enough to say this three or four times. I really don't understand how The Matrix could be in the top-250 at IMDb, but some people like movies with stupid stories if just the action is good. This movie does not deserve more than 4/10.",negative,4,tt0133093
"A lot has been said about this movie: lot of good, some bad. The good is this movie should be praised for the writing, the acting and the directing. Just like the Usual Suspects the twist ending doesn't really lose its luster on a rewatch. You just keep seeing more and more clues that were left along the way. As for the bad: well it's the social message of glorifying male toxicity. It doesn't help that the Alt Right and bro culture have appropriated it. That's not the lens you should look this movie through. Quite the opposite. It speaks to the dangers of it, just like the book. Fincher ran a master class on screenwriting even (according the book's author) improving on the ending. 9/10 - if you can't seen it, watch it. Side note: it's wild for me to say that we are living in a time where some adults weren't born when this came out.",positive,9,tt0137523

"This would have to be one of the best movies of all time, it's original and brilliant unlike The Blair Witch Project. I read the book before seeing the movie and I thought the book was great, the style of writing is second to none.  I was amazed at how David Fincher made it almost exactly like the book, the movie was made superbly it is also original, for instance when it shows Edward Norton and Bradd Pitt explaining what he does with the movie reels and what he does as a waiter. Edward Norton has proved himself to be one of the best actors ever after making Fight Club and American History X, his acting in Fight Club was just amazing.  Bradd Pitt also proved that he is more than just a body for women to stare at, he can act too.  I couldn't picture any other actors doing those parts as well as them.

"You know a movie will be bad when the funny parts of the commercial weren't even funny. Throughout this whole movie, I honestly think they used maybe three sets. I wondering if this was intentional, due to budget, or maybe on purpose (Though it's never mentioned in the movie). Now, this is billed as a 'comedy', which usually means humor. Maybe the writers didn't get that memo. This has as much humor as... An ER? Possibly. The only attempts at ""humor"" (and yes, it deserves to be quoted) in this movie are references. I can't imagine the ""brainstorming"" session the writers must've had: -""Okay, now they just talked to an enemy, what should we include to make this funny?"" -""Let's put the American Idol judges in! They are from real life, so its funny!"" (Though, judging from the script, they probably used smaller words) Now, I have no problem with advertising in movies, or in video games for that matter. It seems to make it more realistic. (I'd rather a character eat at a TGI Friday's instead of a Wednesday's). But it's just plain blatant advertising here. After a character is stranded in the Arctic (or, going back to poor set design, a floor with cotton and white confetti on it), he only survives by seeing a Subway sub on the ground. Humorous? No. Advertisement? Yes. Well, if you want about 80 wasted minutes of your life wasted, pick this up.

"All through watching this film - the thought that it was specially written for Jean Claude Vna Damme kept popping up in my head. The naff storyline, the kick-boxing moves, the lack of dialogue for the leading man, the army of nameless heavies, the almost compulsory Japanese bad guy / girl / even director. The plot - which i will NOT go into here - is rudimentary to say the least. The amount of times people just happen to turn up in scenes without any realistic semblance of how they got there is incredible - it must be a record for a movie. Couple this with the total number of unrealistic stunt moves carried out and you have yourself a bona-fide turkey. For instance, trucks propel themselves forward on their own without a need for a driver, a small plane goes from a hundred feet up in the sky to thousands of feet in a blink, the hero can somehow dodge a thousand bullets and still manage to incapacitate 3 bad guys with nothing more than a jumper !!! i watched this knowing what it was beforehand - a cheesy action flick - but it still took some swallowing to believe the plot. The best award must go to the guy who somehow managed to squeeze a further 2 sequels from this franchise. After the first film - the whole cast and crew should have been sent straight to DVD dungeon never to appear again. How they convinced anyone to make another 2 movies is beyond me. The Transporter is a poor man's Bourne - and that is a derisive remark to Bourne. If Van Damme had done this - then it would have stayed where it belonged - the bargain bin. 3/10 - just for sheer cheek of conning us with this movie.",negative,3,tt0293662
"this film got a 5/10 because i thought the film was too long. the storyline wasn't even that good. there is some sad bits though. i don't recommend this film to be watched when tired, because it makes you fall to sleep. good acting by Morgan freeman. a highlight of the film is it does contain some interesting theories of life. the best part of the film is the ending,very touching i also enjoyed the ending because, it meant i could go to sleep. so overall not a good film, i think its over rated. thats all i have to say on this boring film.. i hope you reading this comment has stopped you from watching this film because its a waste of your time. 143 minutes to be precise.",neutral,5,tt0111161
"The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don."" It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better. 6/10.",neutral,6,tt0068646

"This film basically takes the hero's journey and adds this massive world and large cast of characters to it (kind of like the original Star Wars trilogy). I'm not much of a fantasy guy, so I didn't have very high expectations going into this, and I think that showed throughout the movie. If you haven't read the book (like me), the world building is fantastic but at the same time there is so much of it that it gets a little overwhelming. Let me tell you by the end of the movie I still didn't know the names of half of the characters. The cinematography was really great, and the fight scenes were pretty engaging. The acting was also good, and it felt like all the characters fit this world. I feel like the best part of this movie was the characters, and the world building while visually was done well, as somebody who isn't really into fantasy and never read the books the world building was quite bombarding at times. The production value of the entire thing is great, but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece. I feel like the heart of the movie with the hero's journey was the most engaging part, and I wish they would've focused on that more instead of tons of world building. I'm sure plenty of people would enjoy that way more than me, but it's just not my thing. I think that the movie was crafted very well which brought my rating up, but I didn't enjoy it as much as something like A New Hope, so that prevents it from getting a really high rating. 7.5/10.",neutral,5,tt0120737
"The most fervent of LOTR fans seem to be those who have read the books. Having not read any Tolkien I will have to review the movie as a film in its own right. Although I have seen TFOTR (which I gave 4/10) I still found TTT somewhat of an overload of characters, races and politics.  If you like the books and you liked TFOTR then there isn't any point in reading a review that doesn't declare TTT as the best movie ever...but for those fans of films I will try and point out the main flaws. The biggest problem for those not fans of the books is that we simply don't care about the characters and nothing is done to make us care.  People are introduced to us and 10 minutes later when they are killed/revealed as having unrequited love/had their lands taken from them, we are actually supposed to care.  But why would we? The other criticism would be the overuse of trying to make you believe that the main characters might actually die, only to reveal later on that *gosh* they haven't.  To my count this was done three times and is rather cliche and boring.  Quite childish to be honest. To make it on its own strengths as a movie it needs to lose an hour at least, but I realise that would simply disgust people who avidly boast at the number of times they have read the books.  I said about the first one what I'll say about this...if you need to have already read the books to like the movie and care about the characters then it is *not* a good movie, and this is not a good movie.  I gave it 4/10 also. On the plus side, yes the scenery and computer effects were all wonderful. As were the effects in Terminator 2 but I don't hear anyone claim that as being the best movie of all time.  TTT is just childish nonsense that fails to appeal to children due to the running time and the fact that nothing really happens.",negative,4,tt0167261
"Fairly bland plot considering that it is currently ranked as the 51th best film of all time on imdb. Not much character development but I guess that is what the sequals are for. The consequence of that is that the film really feels like another filler movie to cash out more on the Marvel universe. Hence the ending of the film of course. Avengers infinity war does some good like showing different sides of the antagonist, explaining his motives and the reasoning behind them (unlike that stupid villain in Justice League), and making him do challenging decisions. I also liked the dialouge between the superheroes, especially the Guardians of the galaxy crew and Thor. Their scenes were really funny and I like the fact that humor is a central part between these characters, it makes the movie stick out from other typical superhero action movies, and it shows that it doesn't take itself so seriosuly. Those were some original points that stood out to me and made me not rate it a 3/10.",negative,3,tt4154756

"With Episode 1 opening in Britain on July 16th I decided to take a wander down memory lane. Now I wished I hadn't. Mark Hammill has to be one of the worst actors ever!. I squirmed every time he gave a line - he ruins the entire film. The only redeeming factor is Harrison Ford who knows he's making a kids movie and manages to save face. Hell, even Chewbacca puts in a good performance. Another irritating aspect of this movie is those damn droids - if Lucas was taking the mickey out of the audience then he succeeded. Enough said about them the better. Dialogue is another aspect that really highlights the problems with Star Wars - at times you think Lucas is really making strides then bam - another 'Power convertors' line pops up. I can remember as a young teenager thinking this movie was superb, but in order to enjoy the movie now would require accepting that mark hammill can act - something that can never really be done! 5/10.",neutral,5,tt0076759
"In the early 90s Steven Spielberg had built a reputation as being the master of kid-friendly family films like E.T., Jaws, The Indiana Jones trilogy, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Hook, the list just goes on and on. Sure today he has films like Munich and Saving Private Ryan under his belt so Spielberg making a non kid-friendly film isn't very strange to us, but back then it was unheard of. So considering his previous career, Schindler's List might be the biggest departure from style any director has made in the history of film making. Even if you are among the more ""experienced"" film goers, meaning people who have seen several incredibly violent, disgusting, and down right disturbing films, Schindler's List will still make your stomach turn, and you'll want to look away at some of the more graphic moments in the film. Stephen Spielberg really does not hold back, and tries to give an uncompromising depiction of the holocaust, which in the earlier 90s was not something that was commonly done, sure you had films like Night and Fog, and Shoah, but your average, everyday Joe wasn't going to ever see those films. And there were films like Sophie's Choice, and Judgement at Nuremberg, but they really focused on the after math, and didn't really directly confront their audience the same way that Schindler's List so boldly did. Schindler's List is a biopic about Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party, who is runs a factory, in German occupied Poland, that uses Jews as workers. Oskar Schindler is played ever so greatly by Liam Neeson in what is definitely his best role yet (in my opinion Tom Hanks robbed him of the best actor Oscar). One of the best things about Schindler's List is the character of Oskar Schindler, Oskar Schindler was obviously not a righteous hero throughout the entirety of the film. After all he was a member of the Nazi party, and some viewers may take issue with this, but the film would be so much more dull and lose its complexity and depth, if Schindler was a straight forward hero fighting the bad guys. The way Stephen Spielberg presents it is far more interesting, (after all Stephen Spielberg said he was drawn to the paradoxical nature of Oskar Schindler) and far more accurate to the real life Oskar Schindler, and accuracy is something that Schindler's List strives for. The film was based upon the real life testimonies and accounts of the people who survived the events. Steven Spielberg at first did not want to direct Schindler's List, he didn't think he was ""mature"" enough to handle something as serious as a holocaust film. But eventually decided to do it himself when he saw the rising number of holocaust deniers. Which is probably why he also wanted the film to be as close to reality as possible, he wanted something that would challenge the audience, confront them with the true horrors of the holocaust. Earlier I talked about how great Liam Neeson's performance was, but Ben Kingsley, (who plays a Jewish account, who works for Oskar Schindler) and Ralph Fiennes (who plays an S.S. Officer in charge of a work camp.) both do amazing jobs, Ralph Fiennes was even nominated for best supporting actor at the academy awards. The cinematography, done by Janusz Kaminski who would later do Saving Private Ryan and Minority Report, is also perfect, it is probably among the greatest looking contemporary black & white films out there. The film is also scored by the legendary John Williams, (which is all you really need to know) after John Williams first saw the film, he said it was to beautiful and he was not worthy to score it, the only people that were worthy were dead. Schindler's List won the academy award for both cinematography and soundtrack. Schindler's List was also the first time Steven Spielberg ever won an actual Oscar. (he had previously won the Irving G. Thalberg award but that is just a lifetime achievement award.) Schindler's List was films on a relatively small budget of 22 million dollars, and Steven Spielberg did not accept any money for making the film, he said it would be like accepting blood money. But you would never be able to guess that Schindler's List was shot on a budget a 1/3 of the size of Jurassic Park. The sets are so massive and pay such close attention to detail, and the film was actually shot in the real life locations of where it takes place. The reason Schindler's List was shot on such a small budge was because the Steven Spielberg and the producers thought a holocaust film might bomb, and Steven Spielberg was not known for making R rated films. The film did not bomb it grossed over 320 million dollars world wide, which is over 1/2 a billion dollars in 2016 dollars. I'm not going to pretend that Schindler's List is flawless, perhaps its biggest flaw is the fact that 90% of the film is in English, which really clashes with Spielberg's intent to keep the film as close to reality as possible, and really can take you out of some scenes. Though I could see this not bothering most viewers, because the actors do such a great job portraying the people their playing that it would be hard to imagine anyone else in their roles. Steven Spielberg accomplished his goal of making a holocaust film that would not only be as close to the actual events as physically possible, but he also made it accessible to all audiences, (but for some of the more sheltered viewers, it would be a bit much.) 9.4/10",negative,4,tt0108052
"I eventually saw this film as it is widely regarded as one of the best ever made. The hype and the 10/10 ratings ARE true. This is excellent! I saw Godfather 2 first as it deals with the young Vito in part so comes (chronologically) first in the series but part 1 is the best. From Marlon Brandos oscar-winning performance to Al Pacino (the true star) this film is practically perfect. Vitos demise, Michaels rise, the downfall and eventual success of the Corleone family - all perfectly plotted. Any film that can make you care for gangsters has to be doing something right. There are some dubious moral issues, but this is a movie - you watch it to be entertained. Who can forget the horses head scene, Sonnys assassination, even the oft-repeated quotes such as `I`m gonna make him an offer he can`t refuse`... If you haven`t seen this film then watch it.

"I have always enjoyed watching ""Fortress"", no matter how bad the actual movie is. And that is of course also exactly what these type of movies got made for; to bring some mindless entertainment. The movie in itself is still pretty bad though. The story is quite ridicules and filled with some highly unlikely moments and plot-holes. I mean really, if this is supposed to be a future thought out and created to perfection, it should be back to the drawing boards for the scientists and world leaders, who came up with this stuff and laws. It was still a pretty awesome movie to watch when it came out. All of the effects and sets were pretty decent looking for its time and they helped to give this movie a real futuristic feeling, though when you watch it now it all mostly is being ridicules. It got made back in the days when Christopher Lambert was still quite a big name in the business. This movie got really made as a vehicle for him, as the main action-hero of the movie. He just isn't the most compelling actor that ever lived. Kurtwood Smith is the main villain of the movie and he did a pretty decent job with restraining himself to not go over-the-top with his character, like probably a lot of other actors would had done. The movie also has some other decent actors in it, that fits their roles fine, such as for instance Jeffrey Combs, Lincoln Kilpatrick and Vernon Wells. The story and its storytelling are at times really quite messy and bad but when you can look all past that, ""Fortress"" is still some good mindless fun for you. 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",neutral,5,tt0106950
"When Hardcore Henry was announced for a release I was overly excited to check it out. I am all about pushing the boundaries of filmaking and finding new and original ways to tell a story, so of course this fit perfectly for me. There is always something really exciting to me about seeing new ways in which filmmakers go crazy with imagination and find new places to put that camera or enhance the frame. Whilst Hardcore Henry can certainly boast a remarkable technical achievement, it doesn't end up being the quality film I wished for. There is no question on the triumph of the first person shot on the practical side. It flows perfectly, it rarely ever gets bothering or sickening and even better, you can always tell what is going on for the most part. Thanks also to a brilliant sound design, which is just as vital as the camera work in making the ordeal successful, you definitely get to feel deeply immersed in some points of the film. Especially early on there is a sky sequence that was breathtaking, you really got a sense of vertigo there and the adrenaline that it induced was exhilarating. There are repeated sequences of this and they are all, for my money, the best part of the film. Making this look so good on such a tight budget must have been a real challenge and the filmmakers deserve praise for their technical abilities. The action too is just as impressive. Its storytelling heft will be discussed later, but on a pure technical level it is balls to the wall, batsh*t crazy stuff that will most certainly shock even the toughest viewers. The stunt team does a magnificent job, there clearly isn't too much CGI involved and wherever it is, it is masked brilliantly; there were just a couple of explosions that felt like it, for the rest it was seamless. You felt every shot and punch as if you were there. As I said the violence might be a little too much for some people, it did not bother me and it was definitely an integral part of the distinctive tone and style of the film. That is something it nails through, without having any bothering shifts in it. Its classic violence + dark humor combination, brought to what might be a very extreme but coherent level. Moreover, I have to say that I have not been a fan of Sharlto Copley's acting in the past, but I found nothing to lament here. On the contrary he ends up being the best part of the film. His character must have been a real challenge to pull off and Copley rises to it, brining to life a performance that is as funny as it is crazy. Where this whole movie collapses is in its story and plot. It is really poor. The first person shot unfortunately becomes a gimmick after the first twenty minutes or so and you don't recover from that ever again. I was talking about storytelling and action before, what starts out as a film with integral and thrilling action slowly escalates to a style over substance extravaganza, that being clearly due to absolutely no story or connection picking up. Other than the fact that the plot is as unsubstantial as an action movie plot can get, the characters' motivations are incredibly under-looked and after a good opening you are just left with a less and less interesting movie. I think the focus was just too much on the gimmick and the filmmakers lost the story on the way, ending up with a film that manages to impress for sure, but does not leave the viewer with any satisfaction. I am sure excited to see where Ilya Naishuller goes next, because he clearly has talent, but I don't think I'll ever check this one again.",neutral,5,tt3072482

"There are people who say ""Plan 9 From Outer Space is the worst movie ever made."". I agree this is not a quality film but I disagree that this is the worst film ever made. I have seen worse. Much worse. I would put the film in the category of a fairly decent film to watch for fans of B-rated sci-fi and horror for it's novelty and somewhat entertaining value. You will not see much of Bela Lugosi here...in fact, hardly anything at all from him. He passed away during the filming. You can see quite a bit of Tor Johnson and Vampira in this one. The story is not all that good. In fact is terrible.

"10/10/2019 (4) Fight Club (1999) 9.6/10 Non-spoiler-ish Review I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have to break the first rule. I cannot and I must say that I cannot forget this movie or even stop talking about it after 20 years. Just straight up, this movie is ahead of its time. The story is a non-stop grandeur development. I can't spoil any bits of this masterpiece. Can only say: this movie is about a man. That's IT. I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE. Or else, I'm gonna break the 2nd rule. When I first watched Fight Club in the 2nd year of university, I felt really skeptical. I was scratching my head throughout the whole movie's set up like why the hell is this even in the top 10 IMDB list. And I gotta admit, Fight Club is weird. It's complicated and it might feel like it's going nowhere. I could almost say that I was losing interest in the first act of the movie. But as things build up and just keep building up, I saw the beauty. For the first time in my life, I felt enlightened. I felt something more than just a movie. I was laughing throughout the middle act and then, I got hit really hard in the most disturbing and oddly satisfying way. A movie that can always provoke your thoughts the moment you start watching it again. Fight Club is vulgar, intense and so damn emotional. I would always say that this is neither an action movie nor a thriller movie. But it is Fight Club. It shows me the craziest life journey of a man, being portrayed on a movie screen.

"...or are over twelve years old, I suggest giving this movie a miss. Not being a fan of the Fantasy genre I didn't think I'd enjoy it but usually when I think like this a movie surprises me.  Not this time.  I left the cinema feeling I'd wasted three hours of my life and thinking I should've read the book beforehand.  It wasn't that I didn't understand anything in the film, just that all my mates who had read the book seemed to enjoy it, and the rest of us didn't.  But then again, if a story is good enough it should lose little impact in transferring to the big screen. I won't go on about the faults - although the repetitive storyline (battle, walk; battle, walk) and the needless over-acting are worth a mention.  It was aesthetically pleasing, but huge sets and great CGI don't count for much when you are fighting to keep your eyes open in your chair.  There are only so many times you can gasp at a huge building/statue/mountain before you get bored and start demanding an interesting plot. This film would've been a flop if the book wasn't so well-known.  As it is, thousands will come to see ""how it comes across"" on the big-screen.  These people won't know what it's like to see the story for the first time in this way, and will probably find it difficult to understand why the rest of us keep a blank expression throughout. To cap off, if you enjoyed the book you're likely to enjoy the film.  If you've never read the book you'll be looking at your watch every five minutes from an hour into it, trying to forget how long you'll be in there.

"I know there are a lot of people who have seen this film and even the sequels. But this is the first time I've paid attention to this franchise. Though it is popular, The Matrix failed to deliver good performances and great fighting scenes. The story is new in its genre and year. The Matrix was created in 1999, which is similar to 2010's Inception, where the world is not the world itself anymore. There are two worlds, The Matrix and the actual world. The Matrix is where most people live in and the actual world is only for the ones that rebelled. As refreshingly new the plot is, the writers just had to put in some clichés in the film: the protagonist did not die at the end, the bad guys died, some romance, and badass action scenes. Well, I guess that's what all movies have nowadays. But the film have so many flaws in it like the acting, it is the worse ensembled cast I've seen in years. The actual writing isn't bad but the way the actors delivered the lines are just unpleasant. Another flaw is the fighting scenes. I first thought it was because they were moving too fast and that was the point. But as it progresses, the fighting scenes are just cheap! The Matrix offers a new element to its genre and has really great visual effects but failed to deliver on its performances which made the film dropped.",neutral,5,tt0133093
"I don't see why this is supposed to be one of the greatest films of all time. I think this is just another one of those cases where everyone's convinced themselves it's so great only because the pretentious critics told us it is, and you're so afraid of being considered a philistine that you go along with it, telling yourself, yeah, this really is a masterpiece, even though you were bored by it too. The movie's pretty boring. None of the characters are likeable. All the big moments of the movie build up to nothing more than ""Let's shoot him"" and then they do. That's it. That's all that keeps happening throughout the movie, in between long drawn out dialogue scenes. And the story's not even told very well - so many long conversations that don't really convey anything of any significance; so much pointless stuff happens that doesn't really add to anything to the plot. The movie dumps like 20 characters onto us all at once at the wedding scene at the beginning of the movie and then expects us to keep up with which Italian guy is which for the rest of the 3 hours. I constantly had to pause it to search on the Internet for their names to figure out who they're talking about, which ones are Al Pacino's brothers, which of them are family, which are his in-laws, who is not related to the family, who works for the old man, who works for the rival families, etc. I'll give this film 1/10, not because it's quite that bad, but because it's been severely overrated and deserves to drop down a few stars.

"Okay, folks. It is time. The final one. The 100th movie I'm reviewing from this poster, after 3.5 years of reviews. It's not that I haven't reviewed anything else, besides the poster, in the meantime, and it's not that I'm finished with the poster either - there are still the final posts to make, my top 10 movies out of it and all, but still -it's crazy. My reviews have evolved so much throughout my journey here, and this list and my reviews have been such a major part of my life for so long now. I plan to keep on reviewing movies afterwards, of course, but it still feels unreal. And yeah, I know I've mentioned that before - how surreal it is to me, how cool it is to finally get here - especially in my previous reviews, that is - but again: this is it. Top spot. Let's get into it. Stephen King is one of the best-selling authors of all time, and one of the most adapted authors to cinema, too. In the IMDb top 100 we have three King adaptations: The Shining, which is one of my favorite movies ever, The Green Mile, which I absolutely love as well (made me cry more than almost any other movie I've seen), and this one - The Shawshank Redemption. You could say I've had pretty high expectations, considering my previous experience with The Green Mile, and the fact that this movie is by the same director, Frank Darabont, and adapted from a story by the same author. I didn't expect it to deserve the number one placement, but you could definitely say I was hoping at least for a very good movie. Reasonable expectations, I'd say. The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 movie that follows Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who, despite claiming innocence, got two life sentences in Shawshank Prison after getting convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover. The inmates in Shawshank, and especially our narrator, Red (Morgan Freeman), think, initially, that Andy is going to break quickly under the harshness of prison life. As time passes they all learn that there's more than meets the eye to Andy, and we get to see the relationship that forms between the two, as Andy tries to make his life in prison as tolerable as possible. With films I intend to review, I always make sure to do some research after my first time watching - looking for production stories, fun facts, analysis videos, and I often bring the movie up in some film-nerd group chats I'm in, so I can talk to some people about it as well. Now, Shawshank has been holding the top spot of the IMDb top movies for, like, over a decade and a half by 2024, and it actually was never lower than 4th spot since IMDb popped into the web in 1996. Some movies' placement in this list I don't agree with, sure, but most times I can still understand, sort of, what makes people gravitate towards them. With this one I had a harder time doing so. The selling point of this movie, I realized when digging into it, is the way it depicts, and explores, the idea of hope. The mind's superiority over the body, the way your inner world can help you overcome hardships - these ideas are compelling to people because they give them hope, because they're simple, and because they focus on self-growth, which we all know is an easy way to get people hooked up into your usual, inspirational type narrative. It's about letting go of what we can't control, and maneuvering between the rough parts when we can to make our lives better. And I do want to emphasize: it's not like there's no way to tell a truly deep story that explores these themes in a moving way, but this theme is such a lowest-common-denominator thing, so much so that it feels a bit too generic for me, I guess, like the sort of movie teachers would show their students as a reward for behaving well in class or something. The movie doesn't do a bad job at it - it's a nice theme to explore, sure, and the movie manages to depict people who do break in prison, and it does a good job making us hate some of the prison staff, and empathize with the prisoners enough to care for them. In the end of the day, though, I just feel like it's nothing more than nice. It's so blandly American in its essence, if you know what I mean. Textbook stuff, maybe just a bit more than that. But deserving the top spot, and for that long? Really, guys? I'm sorry, but no way. Not even close. Some rapid-fire compliments: There are some cool plot elements - there's pretty decent foreshadowing, for instance, and things come together in a nice way towards the ending. Andy really does feel like a pretty clever character, and it's satisfying to see his way to get what he wants. I like the way his relationships with other inmates develop throughout the movie, too. The cinematography is pretty nice, and same goes for the cast and the performances - maybe a bit too Hollywood-esque, but still very nice. The pacing is pretty good, but the movie itself isn't super rewatchable - my first time watching went by pretty fast, but the second time kind of lost me. The thing is that, again, even when I compliment aspects of this movie I don't think they're fully great - I can't even wholeheartedly say they're *very* good - and I can finish praising each element here in a short sentence. So yeah, just goes to show you that top spot is pretty much madness. I can't help but go back and think about Green Mile - same director, same author, and another movie that can be seen as simple, in many ways (though I do think it has stronger cinematography than Shawshank has). Yet, the emotional core of The Green Mile is so strong (and so much stronger than Shawshank) that it actually boosts the movie to surpass most films in the IMDb top 100, in my opinion, which I, personally, wouldn't even consider saying about Shawshank. Maybe it all comes down only to the strength of the source material itself. Maybe Darabont is able to adapt things faithfully, without giving them any twist or extra element (unlike Kubrick with The Shining, which King hated, by the way), so the movie will only be as strong as the source material is. But then again, I haven't read any of the two stories, so I'm only speculating here, though considering the fact that King loves the Shawshank movie adaptation, it's more likely than not to be pretty accurate to the source material. One nitpicky complaint regarding the voiceover stuff: I don't always have issues with that sort of thing, but I think that in this type of story and medium, with all due respect to Morgan Freeman's very nice and rich voice, you need sometimes to prioritize the ""show"" over the ""tell"", especially if the narrator is not one with a lot of character (narrators who do have a lot of character can be found in City of God, for instance, or in Fight Club). And when we're talking about movies that were adapted from books, where voiceover stuff can feel like the laziest way to go about things, I think there are more interesting directions to go for. Not horrible, but it gets a little tiresome for me. The Shawshank Redemption, despite being directed by the same director, and adapted from a story by Stephen King as well, doesn't reach the heights of The Green Mile. It's about hope, and the way the spirit can overcome the hardships of life, and I guess that many people just feel inspired by it, find it compelling. Well, even though I do empathize with the inmates, and like the way bits and pieces of foreshadowing come together towards the final act, I can't say that there's even one amazing element in this movie. Not even a great one, to be honest. So it's definitely a disappointment, for a movie this highly regarded. It's a very nice movie, though, and pretty consistent one at that. It sucks that I can't even say it's a really good movie, but that will suffice - it's worth your time, but don't believe the hype. I'm feeling a 6.9/10 on this one.",positive,9,tt0111161
"What's the first rule of Fight Club again? Ask this question at almost any workplace, high school, or public environment in America and you're sure to get a response. ""The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club"". It's every teen's favourite film, and contains their favourite quote. Yet many people seem to overlook the discreet charm of Fight Club. The film basically follows like this: an average, stereotypical working- class man finds that his average, everyday life goes through a series of changes after meeting several characters throughout the movie. The first of these characters is Bob, a man with testicular cancer who gives Norton's character the desire to try and help, as he becomes addicted to the feeling of not being judged. Norton's character then notices an oddity in these groups, a fellow ""poser"". This is Marla Singer, who he feels is stopping him from truly feeling this euphoria he felt earlier. Over time, he and Marla arrange a schedule in which they will each meet at different therapy sessions so they don't have to confront each other, which satisfies Norton's character. But then he meets the infamous Tyler Durden, who literally embodies everyone we want to be. Did you ever want to make that racist joke in a meeting that would have provoked laughs from anyone and everyone, but were afraid to? Don't worry, Tyler made it. And he's happy he did. Tyler, as a character, is symbolic of a man's dream life. While we generally cling to our own safety, all of us, at one point or another, want to do something big, something crazy, and be free for once in life. Tyler is this freedom. The rest of the film shows the progression of Norton's character slowly turning into a character more and more similar to Tyler as the two of them work together to produce a massive crime empire known as Project Mayhem, after, that is, they set up underground fight clubs all over the local area. Tyler and Marla become friends with benefits, although without the friends part. Bob ends up being shot after a prank involving a giant globe and a coffee shop goes wrong. Norton's character questions life and death, and what his life really means. But these are all just plot points to progress and add to the film's parallelism, which is, in essence, that we all strive for freedom even though we live our lives in safety. Fight Club is unique in that it doesn't make a true and to-the-point statement. It just forces you to ask questions about life. ""This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time,"" Norton's character famously cites. ""Is what I'm doing right now contributing to making my life the best it can be?"" Maybe that's the question Fight Club demands its viewers to ask. But, like Van Sant's ""Elephant"", Fincher's Fight Club will never have a definitive answer. We will never know everything about the film, about its obscure ideas, nor what it really wants the viewer to think of or do. It sets up plot points and abandons them, and although it seems to have a clearly set narrative, it doesn't seem to concern itself with a plot. It simply moves on ahead, not concerned with its infinite plot inconsistencies. Although the films seem about as different as they come, you could make quite an interesting comparison to this and ""Elephant"". They both bring up interesting and sometimes dark questions, and the truth is that we as an audience will never fully understand them, and one guess is as good as the other. Is Norton's character schizophrenic? Is it all a surreal dream, as is Lynch's ""Mulholland Dr.""? Who knows? Rating: 9/10",positive,9,tt0137523

"First of all, this movie is overrated, apart from watching the old Bruce working his way out of an typical Hollywood narrative film, there isn't really anything else. kung fu chick? a random hacker? there isn't anything about them in the movie, it's like they just made up some random characters in order to keep the stories going, very poor effort. and the cg chases n explosions , seen better years back, nothing special.. But the worst fact about this movie was a total rip off from an anime movie called 'you're under arrest!' released in year 1999 in Japan. and it's almost identical that during the first 15min of the movie I could grasp the entire storyline/plot. so yah, this movie isn't good for various reasons, the one i dislike the most about was the rip off without saying anything about it. if you don't believe me, watch the anime, you WILL be shocked how ""similar"" they are. overall 4/10, 4 for Bruce Willis. 0 for story",negative,4,tt0337978

The first one did too (though it works better on DVD), but this one topped it. There were pointless changes to the characterization from the novel and the effects were very variable, though the Gollum character was brilliantly realized.

"There are movies you enjoy while watching, and then there are movies that stay with you long after the credits roll. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare films. It's not just a great movie it's a deeply emotional and unforgettable experience. Every time I watch it, I feel like I've witnessed something truly meaningful, something that speaks to the human spirit in the most powerful way. On the surface, The Shawshank Redemption is about a man sent to prison for a crime he didn't commit. But it's really about so much more hope, friendship, perseverance, and the quiet strength it takes to hold onto your soul in a place that tries to break you. It's a story that resonates with people from all walks of life, and it only seems to get better with age. Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a quiet, intelligent banker wrongly convicted of murdering his wife. What makes Andy so compelling is the way he carries himself calm, composed, and always thinking ahead, even when everything around him is falling apart. Robbins gives a subtle but powerful performance that makes you believe in Andy's inner strength. Then there's Morgan Freeman as Ellis ""Red"" Redding, the narrator and Andy's closest friend inside Shawshank prison. Freeman's voice alone is iconic, but his performance is so much more than narration. He brings wisdom, warmth, and a quiet sadness to Red that makes him feel incredibly real. His journey from a man resigned to life behind bars to someone who dares to hope again is one of the most beautiful parts of the movie. The relationship between Andy and Red is the heart of the film. It's not a dramatic or overly emotional friendship it's quiet, steady, and built on mutual respect. Watching their bond grow over the years is both heartwarming and heartbreaking. Their conversations are filled with meaning, and their support for one another gives the movie its emotional core. Director Frank Darabont's storytelling is masterful. He takes Stephen King's short story and turns it into something deeply cinematic without relying on flashy effects or action. Everything is paced just right, with the story slowly unfolding over decades, letting us live alongside the characters. By the time the final act arrives, the emotional payoff is nothing short of breathtaking. The film's message about hope is what hits the hardest. Shawshank is a bleak place full of injustice, violence, and despair - yet Andy refuses to give up. His quiet defiance, his planning, his unwavering belief in something better... it all builds to one of the most satisfying and powerful endings in film history. The final scene is simple, but it carries a lifetime of meaning. Technically, the film is near perfect. The cinematography captures both the claustrophobia of prison life and the moments of quiet beauty within it. The score by Thomas Newman is haunting and emotional - never overpowering, always just right. And the script is filled with memorable lines, especially Red's narration, which gives the film a poetic feel. What makes The Shawshank Redemption so cool is that it doesn't try too hard. It's not flashy or loud. It tells its story with honesty, patience, and heart. And that's why it continues to connect with people all over the world, even decades after its release. It reminds us that no matter how dark life gets, hope is a powerful thing. And sometimes, it really can set you free. 10/10. A must-watch. Not just a movie an experience.",positive,10,tt0111161
"A family stumble upon a run down, dilapidated home, run by a very strange man, named Torgo. There is so much hate for this movie, hate that's almost legendary, it appears often as one of the worst movies of all time, could that possibly be the case? It's not good, it's far from good, but it's oddly entertaining, I have definitely seen worse, and considering the tiny budget they clearly had for it, they did a half way decent job. The acting is questionable at best, but it somehow seems to fit the film. The Women, yes the women will all be mine, I want that on a t shirt, it's one of a long line of hilarious, perhaps unintentionally funny lines.

"... since Tim Burton's ""Batman"". No argument here, both movies are masterpieces, and this movie is in a different vein, so, comparisons are unfair to both sides. With that said, on to the review of Chris Nolan's ""Dark Knight"". The only problems I found in this movie are: it's a little pretentious for just being the story of a guy with a bat-suit, and the dialog has some silly stuff here and there... but that's just minor nitpicking, compared with the engaging and emotionally exhausting experience this movie is. This movie is one of those who puts you in the edge of your seat the whole time. The performances are excellent in general, but Ledger's Joker, is brilliant, one of the most frightening characters in the history of cinema. The story has ups, downs, adventure, comedy, drama, tragedy, redemption, sadness... it's incredible. It's like riding in a roller coaster, but with the Joker seated next to you: Funny and frightening. That sums up the movie. Perfect score for this thrilling ride to Mr. Nolan. 10/10",positive,10,tt0468569
"The crew clearly knew they had to have fun with this movie, and it shows in the way it was made. There are homages to the game series all over the place, and the over-acting is just hilarious. A few good one-liners here and there too. The First-Person-Shooter sequence is a trip, and is something everyone should watch, even if it is just for kicks. It clearly can't be taken seriously, but it makes for a great laugh when watching. It's probably the most authentically true thing to the game, in the entire movie. But the film is not all fun and games. The entire plot is cliché-ridden (to the point that I was rhyming off lines, and knowing exactly what was coming mere seconds before it showed), and is totally not truthful with the original storyline. Instead, it seems like it just rips from other movies, and attempts to make it sound a little more plausible than the game's plot-line. And while The Rock is a great character actor, he overshadows main character Karl Urban a bit too much for his own good. The supporting cast are most throwaway characters, and its a shame because there were more than a few times they could have pulled off some clever sub-plots to make up for the silliness. I can't deny that it didn't entertain me for 2 hours though. 5/10.",neutral,5,tt0419706
"Strong, meaningful and everlasting message is what makes this movie such powerful. The Hope, the Life and the Friendship are elements of Great Impact and are well incorporated in this feature. But, lots of flaws also. This movie lacks originality. Approach, characters and dialogues are rather cliched and mold. Portraying of characters is loose and poor. Dialogues are pretty ordinary and too conventional. Overall approach is just Routine and  the whole movie is based on the Final Impact of  the story. In short, its actually not surprising no Oscar winning and no including into the 100 Greatest Movies by American Film Institute.

"Home Alone is a beloved holiday classic that has earned its place in pop culture, but upon closer viewing, it's not without its flaws. The premise of a young boy left home alone and defending his house from bumbling burglars is undeniably creative, and the film is packed with memorable moments. Macaulay Culkin shines as Kevin McCallister, delivering a charming and confident performance that makes him an easy character to root for. The slapstick humor involving the Wet Bandits (played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) is entertaining, though it sometimes feels overly cartoonish. The movie's strengths lie in its humor, heartwarming family moments, and iconic holiday atmosphere. However, the plot requires significant suspension of disbelief, and some of the humor hasn't aged as well as the nostalgic vibes would suggest. Additionally, the pacing can feel uneven, with a slow buildup to the chaotic and entertaining finale. Despite these shortcomings, Home Alone remains an enjoyable watch during the holiday season. While it may not resonate as strongly with everyone beyond its nostalgic charm, it's still a fun and feel-good movie that has earned its reputation as a holiday favorite. A solid 6/10 for delivering festive fun and laughs, even if it doesn't quite hold up to its legendary status.",neutral,6,tt0099785

"Shoot a simple movie, split it into parts, rearrange them from last to first, then add some other footage between them but in normal continuance and there you have a messed up movie! I think people like it because they get confused while watching it. Just watch the parts last to first (actually in normal order) you'll see that there is not that much of ingenuity in it. It's a highly exaggerated movie. The performances are also not that good either. When rating a movie, people should consider and compare it with other productions. I mentioned about the ""last to first"" thing because it is really not a spoiler. You understand it at the beginning of the film. But I recommend those who have not seen the movie yet to skip this paragraph - The part which I hate the most is where Leonard ""the poor victim which suffers from memory loss"" suddenly turns out to be a man who can control his memories. It is contrary to the main theme of the movie. I think this is where the whole movie becomes senseless. Memento is rated R for violence, language and some drug content but why doesn't it say that there is some nudity? There is a scene where Guy Pearce is nude and you can see his ass. If it was Carrie-Anne Moss's or Jorja Fox's ass, wouldn't it be different? Normally I wouldn't give such a bad rating to Memento; I gave 1/10 due to its high rating which it definitely doesn't deserve. Actually it is not that bad if you watch it without great expectations.

"Doom (2005) is a movie I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a group of space marines sent to a site on Mars where strange events were reported. Little do they know they're walking into the gates of hell... This movie is directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak (Romeo Must Die) and stars Karl Urban (Pathfinder), Dwayne Johnson (Rampage), Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl), Richard Brake (31) and Ben Daniels (Rogue One). The storyline for this had a good set up but falls apart quickly after entering the spacecraft. The intensity and circumstances are well established but the story turns to mush quickly. The CGI is really bad so the monsters look ridiculous. The weapons are cool and some of the fight scenes are good that don't involve monsters. It's too bad because the gore when they don't overuse CGI is good. Then the movie turns into video game mode to ensure it gets a 1 or 2 rating out of 10. Overall this movie is a bad mashup that doesn't work in any way. I'm sure the Rock pretends this movie doesn't exist. I would score this a 2/10 and recommend skipping it.",negative,2,tt0419706
"This is a feel-good French movie full of all the stereotypes based on a true story. I won't rate the real story. But how does it stand as a movie? Philippe is an aristocratic quadriplegic white millionaire living in Paris, and he's interviewing for a personal carer. Driss is an arrogant African who is only interviewing to get a signature for his social assistance form. The characters are truly stereotypes. On top of it all, I don't particularly like either characters. Philippe is uptight but his paralysis really restrict his acting. Driss is Arrogant Without Reason. Add a stereotypical large immigrant family, and you've got the standard street hustler. When Driss draws a painting, everybody is surprised. Why? I didn't know black people can't draw. Are the French really that racist and ignorant? The actual man this character is based on is a Muslim. That would have been a fascinating in-depth character rather than this simplistic caricature. There was one possible great moment. Driss stole a Fabergé egg from Philippe. When Philippe brings it up, there were many different ways it could have gone. The film chooses one of the least interesting. That's indicative of the whole movie. I don't hate the movie. I'm just ambivalent. Definitely no more than 6/10.

"I can't decide which side of ""Clerks II"" feels forced from a writing perspective, the jokey side or the serious side. Smith here seems to be going for the sort of maturity he hit on with ""Chasing Amy"" but mostly comes off as hopelessly sentimental (almost ""Jersey Girl"" sentimental) and on occasion hopelessly inappropriate and stupid (the Bollywood dance number that pops up around the hour mark and the soap opera confrontation at Mooby's late in the film). The jokes here work much, much better than the other side of the film, but sometimes it feels like Smith is really far more interested in the romance angle. Smith's worst mistake while writing this film was including the whole bestiality sub-plot. To be honest I didn't find it offensive at all, just horrifically unfunny. The best bits here are the geeky conversations early in the film, which is the only thing here that feels authentic and comes across as something Smith can still relate to. The film deteriorates rapidly in the second half after Kelly and the sexy stud arrive. It's just not funny and the romance becomes awfully cheap and silly. The best thing about the second half of the film (and maybe the whole film) is the ending, a wonderful tribute to fans and just generally a great ending. ""Clerks II"" does have some positives, mainly the acting. Smith has certainly improved drastically as an actor's director with the completely undependable Jason Mewes (by his own admission, and Smith's as well) doing quite well here, Smith himself offering his best turn as Silent Bob outside ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"", Rosario Dawson somehow not being horrifically annoying as per usual, and the two leads Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson performing better than I could have ever expected them to. Smith's work as director here is frustrating. I still think he hit a peak with ""Chasing Amy"" and ""Dogma"" and is becoming increasingly dependent on 'retro' stylistic touches (just see the awful montages here for an example). He talked about Harvey Weinstein trying to get him to do the Green Hornet movie and said: ""doesn't anybody f-cking get it?! After 12 years, I'm not that talented"", insisting that he needs to stick to doing what he's good at, stories like ""Clerks II"". I'm not sure that's true. I hate to say it but Kevin Smith just doesn't seem able to connect to the whole Jersey saga feel any longer. He's too rich, too comfortable, and too far removed from the lifestyle. I'm sure he can still write vulgar jokes well but maybe he needs to make a film about rich filmmakers next. It feels false and a far cry from the sheer authenticity and believability of ""Clerks"". 4/10",negative,4,tt0424345

"""Hardcore Henry"" is about Henry, who's resurrected from his dead, and modified with some robotic parts. He wakes up without memory and with one goal: save his wife. The film was directed by Ilya Naishuller and he did a fine job. He used a technique that hasn't been used before, or at least not to this extent, and that technique is filming the movie totally from the perspective of the protagonist. There are objective shots: everything is viewed from the eyes of the main character. This technique didn't really speak to me at first, because before watching the movie, I was anticipating it to be nauseating and hard to follow. I was correct on one of those two things: it was indeed hard to follow. Henry's head moves from one place to another very quickly numerous times in the film, by which you don't really know what's going on. Another thing I want to say about this technique is that it gets boring after a while. It's always the same perspective, and that gets repetitive. Ilya Naishuller was nonetheless able to create some good action scenes, over the top at times, but entertaining and cool to watch. The editing also made the movie hard to follow. I found the editing to be one of the worst parts of the film. There was an overuse of jump cuts, that really didn't fit and when they tried to hide edits, by shadows or him moving quickly or something, it always was noticeable. The soundtrack was unfitting, but some of the songs were good, just didn't fit the moment or the theme the film had set up, which is a shame. Sometimes the instrumental songs helped to create a tense scene, but these instrumental songs where almost every time the same song. This didn't really bother me, because the song did what it was supposed to do. At times they tried to use these tense songs in scenes to create a comedic effect, like when Henry is seen changing clothes in a small shop. That really didn't work for me, which was the case with most of the jokes. The stunt work I found to be very good. There were some impressive stunts pulled of, which were very entertaining to watch. A thing that I really disliked about the film was the sound design. It was lazy and repetitive; often you could hear the exact same sound a couple of times in a row. The acting was good. I can't really say anything about the acting of the actor of Henry, because we don't see his face, and only his body. So I'll start with Sharlto Copley. He had the chance to shine, because of the opportunities given by his character. Normally Copley is a good actor and this time he proves this once again. I very much liked his diverse range of acting capabilities. The actress who played Henry's wife, wasn't really that convincing to me. She couldn't really act and often just looked emotionless, which, of course, isn't a good thing. She was played by Haley Bennett, who has yet to amaze me by her performances. This one didn't really do the job. Danila Kozlovsky played the villain of the film. He gave an OK, clichéd performance, but it was good enough for what the movie was asking him to be. The writing was just fine, nothing spectacular. The plot was pretty thin and seen before, but the first person aspect gives a twist to the whole thing. The characters were badly developed. They actually weren't developed at all, except for Copley's character, whereby he was the most likable of the few characters we see. His character was also the funniest of the all and managed to give me a few chuckles, but only his jokes were the ones that managed that. There were a lot of times the film tried to be comedic, but just failed at it. Due to the lack of characterization, I didn't feel anything for the characters and wasn't rooting for the main character. The villain is also your generic villain you see in every film. He didn't have any good motivation and he just felt flat. I didn't have any reason to hate him, nor like him. He was just there doing bad things, and that's the only thing that they give him. The film also tries to be like a first-person shooter, which I get, because of the whole first person aspect of the movie, but this wasn't transferred well into the script. Some lines felt like they could've been ripped right out of the tutorial of a shooting game, but this just didn't fit in those moments in the film. Copley is the one who's continuously telling Henry what he has got to do next, which is just very lazy storytelling. The twist at the end is something that I didn't really see coming, which sort of made up for some of the mistakes of the film. But that twist has also been done a lot of other times in a lot of movies, in which they handled it better and in which there was a better climax. In this film the climax seemed to go on forever. In the beginning it was cool and all, but after a while I just wanted it to end already, because the payoff didn't really pay off. In the end ""Hardcore ""Henry"", was an OK, disposable action flick, which brings an interesting, new technique to the table, that didn't really work out very well. The characters were badly written and developed, with the exception of Copley. His character was the most diverse and fun to watch. 5.4/10",negative,4,tt3072482
This is the best movie I have ever seen. In a way I feel I am in a prison of life myself. Restricted to doing certain things. Sometimes I get frustrated and feel as I should runaway to some place where I could feel free. I hope and dream for it sometime. This movie just reminds me of my feelings so much. I love Andy Dufresne most in this movie. Although critics say Tim Robbins didn't do enough to express the character but my personal opinion is that he was made for this role. I can go on and say more but I said the most important thing which I feel whenever I watch it. I am glad to visit IMDb. I never heard of it before. Some 7 years ago I saw it at no.2 in the rankings and decided to watch it immediately. Only other movie which even comes close to this is Citizen Kane. But that is about past and this one is about hope and freedom. I give it 11/10.,positive,11,tt0111161
"The story is great, the idea is perfect, the actors are too good, the scenes are too epic. I, who am not a fan of movies with a lot of killing and blood, had to skip parts of the fight. Although I skipped those scenes, I was interested in who would win. The parts where there is no fighting (those dialogues and so on) were interesting and fun for me. The beginning was a bit boring for me because I didn't understand what was going on. Later I understood and it became quite interesting. The ending was really great for me. The movie certainly has a sad story for me. My rating is 7.4/10, which ended up being a 7. That's just because I'm not a fan of killing, blood, fighting and guns. Does the film deserve to be on the top 250 list? - definitely Does it deserve to be on my best movies list? - That's actually a big maybe. I found the pve scenes outside of the fights really interesting. But it's still not my style, so I'm not sure about it. Also, Djimon Hounsou is too good an actor. He is that black slave, I think his name is Juba.",negative,4,tt0172495
"""When shock replaces storytelling - the anatomy of pure disgust."" If The Human Centipede (First Sequence) was a disturbing idea twisted into an almost artistic experiment, then The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) is that same idea dragged into the mud and beaten until there's nothing left but rot. Where the first film at least pretended to explore the psychological and moral horror of dehumanization, this sequel is nothing but filth masquerading as art. I rated it a 2 out of 10, not because it failed to disturb me, but because it succeeded for all the wrong reasons. This isn't horror - it's cinematic self-harm. I went into this film knowing it would be extreme. I was ready for discomfort. I can handle ""unsettling."" But The Human Centipede II doesn't aim to unsettle - it wants to punish its audience. It abandons everything that made the original at least conceptually interesting and replaces it with cheap sadism, cruelty, and an obsession with shock value so juvenile it feels like a dare. It's not just disgusting - it's insulting. The first film, for all its flaws, had a twisted sense of control. It was clinical, sterile, detached - unsettling in its methodical approach. The sequel strips that away entirely. It's shot in black and white, as if the filmmaker thought removing color would somehow give it ""art-house"" credibility, but all it really does is highlight the grime, the filth, and the ugliness. It's not stylized - it's suffocating. Every frame feels sticky and diseased. Then there's the protagonist: Martin. A man so grotesque, so cartoonishly repellent, that he stops being a character and becomes a caricature of shock cinema. There's no depth, no psychology, no tragedy - just a violent, obsessed, mentally unwell man who idolizes the first film and decides to recreate it on a larger, even more depraved scale. You could argue this is commentary on fandom, obsession, or the desensitization of audiences - but the film never earns that interpretation. It wallows in its own depravity too gleefully to have any real insight. It wants you to believe it's ""meta,"" but it's really just masturbatory cruelty. The violence here isn't scary, or even particularly clever - it's torture for the sake of torture. Every sequence feels designed not to horrify you emotionally but to physically repel you. There's a difference between being shaken and being sickened, and this movie doesn't understand the line. It's like it wants to prove it can go further, be nastier, more shocking than anyone else - as though ""more disgusting"" somehow equals ""more meaningful."" It doesn't. It's just noise and gore with no purpose. I was already disgusted by the people who made the first film, but this one pushed my disgust into genuine contempt. There's a kind of arrogance in filmmaking like this - a belief that you can vomit out depravity and call it ""bold art"" just because it offends people. But offense isn't art. Pushing boundaries without reason isn't brave - it's hollow. The Human Centipede II feels like it hates its own audience. It doesn't want you to think; it wants you to recoil. And the sad part is, it doesn't even have the craftsmanship to make that recoil meaningful. Tom Six should've stopped after the first Human Centipede. As disturbing as that film was, at least it had a concept - a bizarre, unethical, but genuinely thought-provoking idea about control, identity, and dehumanization. There was no need to make a sequel, let alone a trilogy. The first movie had already made its point. Continuing the series didn't expand the idea - it destroyed it. The sequels took something that could've remained a psychological experiment in horror and turned it into an ugly, self-parodying mess. Sometimes a filmmaker doesn't realize when to stop, and Six is the perfect example of that. He didn't know when to put down the scalpel. Six is not a visionary - he's a provocateur who mistakes disgust for depth. His films don't explore darkness; they celebrate it in the most juvenile, self-indulgent way possible. The Human Centipede II feels less like a story and more like a man daring you to keep watching. That's not art - that's sadism. It's as though he's addicted to his own notoriety, constantly pushing for shock because he has nothing else to offer. The worst part is that he seems proud of it, as if being banned or censored somehow validates him as an artist. But controversy isn't creativity, and pushing boundaries without meaning is just cinematic nihilism. The irony of Six's career is that his obsession with being different made him completely predictable. Every movie after The Human Centipede feels like the same ugly trick repackaged with less restraint and less purpose. He mistakes repulsion for relevance, and every new film is proof that he's run out of ideas. If the first Centipede was shocking because it was new, the sequels are just exhausting. Watching them is like watching someone shout louder and louder because they ran out of things to say. There's no evolution, no introspection - just escalation for its own sake. His later work - The Onania Club, Gay, Honeys, I Love Dries - are proof that he never grew as a writer or director. Each one tries to provoke but forgets to actually say anything. They're all shock wrapped in emptiness, offensive for the sake of attention. The Onania Club, for instance, has a concept that could've been a biting satire of voyeurism and moral hypocrisy, but it turns into another exercise in cruelty and exploitation. The rest are even worse - films that feel like pranks rather than stories. Six isn't a misunderstood genius; he's a filmmaker who confuses disgust with meaning. There was never any artistic reason for The Human Centipede to become a trilogy. The concept works as a one-time nightmare - a disturbing thought experiment that shocks you once and leaves you haunted. Stretching it into multiple films robbed it of mystery and turned it into a circus act. By the time The Human Centipede III came out, the entire idea had devolved into pure grotesque comedy - a parody of its own notoriety. What could've been a single bold statement became a punchline. Six didn't build a legacy; he dismantled one. He fails not just as a storyteller, but as a moral artist. It's not about censorship or taste - it's about purpose. There's no purpose behind his films beyond provocation. Great horror directors like Cronenberg, Ari Aster, or Lars von Trier (at their best) use discomfort to challenge ideas, to explore the human condition. Six just uses it to gross people out. That's not bravery - that's laziness. The more he tries to be ""edgy,"" the more he proves he has nothing to say. It's honestly sad to see a filmmaker with one controversial hit spiral into self-parody and refuse to learn from it. If there's one thing missing from all of Six's later work, it's self-awareness. He thinks he's making statements about society, about obsession, about human depravity - but he's actually just indulging in it. The Human Centipede II could've been a smart critique of fandom and the dangers of idolizing violence, but it's too busy rolling in its own filth to make the point. Instead of examining the monster, he becomes it. Every sequel, every new project, feels like a desperate scream for attention, not a conversation. If there's one single thing that prevents this film from being a 0/10, it's that there's some technical competence behind the camera. The black-and-white cinematography, while grotesque, does give a certain grimy aesthetic that fits its world. But that's like complimenting the stitching on a corpse. It's irrelevant when the soul of the film is dead. I could forgive the first movie for trying to be unsettling and accidentally becoming absurd. But I can't forgive this. The Human Centipede II is a deliberate descent into moral sewage. It's not a movie that provokes thought - it's a movie that tests your stomach. It has no intelligence, no restraint, no humanity. Just cruelty. It's rare for me to feel genuine anger toward a film, but this one earned it. I'm disgusted - not just by what I saw, but by what it says about the people who made it. If the first Human Centipede asked, ""What if horror stripped away humanity?"" this sequel answers, ""What if we did that to cinema itself?"" As much as I loathe nearly everything about The Human Centipede II, I have to admit that the acting, oddly enough, is better than in the first film. The performances feel less stiff and more committed, especially given how absurd and disgusting the material is. Laurence R. Harvey, who plays Martin, fully embodies his role with a disturbing physicality and a kind of grotesque vulnerability that's hard to look away from. It's not good acting in a traditional sense - it's horrifying to watch - but it's convincing. He doesn't play a cartoon and ridiculous villain like Dr. Heiter from the first film; he plays someone painfully real in his insanity, which makes the experience somehow even more uncomfortable. What makes it worse, ironically, is that the actors sell it. Every scream, every tremor, every nervous breakdown feels disturbingly authentic. The supporting cast - mostly victims - manage to convey real panic and despair, and it's honestly unsettling how believable their reactions are. The realism of their performances gives the movie a texture of credibility that the first film lacked. Unfortunately, that realism is wasted on a script with no soul. It's proof that good acting can't save a film that has no direction, no message, and no moral compass. The cast deserved a better story; instead, they were trapped in one of the most revolting concepts ever filmed. Not because it failed, but because it never cared to try. It's everything I hate about shock horror - loud, tasteless, self-satisfied, and proud of its own monstrosity. Watching it feels like staring into the abyss and realizing the abyss isn't staring back - it's laughing.",negative,0,tt1530509

"This film was a strategically marketed film with a simple idea in mind-sell one ticket to every 18-24 year old male in America. It adapted a simple idea of an ""underground,"" a sub-culture which the majority of persons are not entirely aware of. That was a good idea in and of itself. Allowing the average person a glimpse into an unknown, yet fascinating, world makes for excellent marketing. The more guns, drugs, and cops, the better. Neil Moritz chose to not get picky with details. Well done. Rather, he saw the movie through the demographic's eye. For the most part, we don;t care about cheesy effects and run-ons, as long as the movie keeps it's promise: lots of action with few details. It did. For the car-fanatics out there, myself included, there's a bakers dozen and a half of errors. Who cares? It was good fun if you took it lightly and checked your automotivelly superior attitude at the door. If not, you ended up like most of the posters. Caught up in arrogance. As a whole, this was definitely not Oscar-worthy. Well orchestrated action sequences (it IS Mic Rodgers) and a semi-plausible plot make this a joy to those who accept it for what it is; a fun movie. 7.5/10",neutral,5,tt0232500

"I've enjoyed a large chunk of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. Not all of them worked for me, but I gotta say Avengers: Infinity War has set the bar really high for Superhero movies. Without spoiling anything (and believe me, this is a movie that works best without spoilers!), all I can say is there is a lot of darker and edgier stuff that will surprise you, as well as the Comedy you expect from a Marvel movie. However, perhaps most surprising was the main villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) having alot of character development in it. He's a bit more complex than your standard Superhero villain, but also very menacing and quite sympathetic too. I worried about the movie having such a long running time and having to 
focus on a lot of the characters, but to Marvel's credit, they pulled it off extremely well and the 2 and a half hours running time went pretty quick. The action is what you'd expect from an Avengers movie, it was never boring to me and I found it pretty funny myself. No issues with the CGI and everyone acted decently in it. The amount of discussions I had with friends and families after coming out of seeing it was insane, as well as the other audiences. Depending on how invested you were into the Marvel characters in previous movies will affect how you feel about it, but I think as a movie that ties and groups a lot of the characters together in one big Blockbuster, Infinity War has exceeded what I can hope for. It had action, emotion, comedy, and is pretty close to a perfect package you could expect from one of these movies. I can't wait to re-watch it and hopefully part 2 will live up to expectations. 9.5/10",neutral,5,tt4154756

"Back when this movie was born, I didn't get the chance to watch it. I'm glad I did today, of course, the 10th anniversary remastered version. In general, it's a typical action-oriented Hollywood blockbuster, where there's not much plot involved. But this film successfully keeps its pace at a mid rate that doesn't make audience fall asleep, which is good for its genre. Compared to action thrillers like Bourne films, it lacks twists, while compared to formulaic ones like Kill Bill and 300, it still offers you a lot to see; not to mention that it's got a good ending. As for the acting, not THAT much can be pointed out as outstanding since for a historical epic like this, it's mainly about men's bravery and the like. But, Russell Crowe's portrayal as Maximus is beyond awesome! He really brought the character into life as well as some depth. And of course, he's looking handsome as always (said by me, a boy who's not gay :D, LOL). Other characters do well enough to keep the film go on, but perhaps it's due to the simplicity of the parts for them that they do just good but not great on the whole. On the other hand, directing, coloring (post-production), score and staging are all very well done. The colorful cinematography reaches state of art. Everything, ranging from constructions, sceneries, costumes to decorations of rooms, is beautifully colorful. Action sequences are where the film truly stands out. Apart from being well choreographed, there're also many little innovations to them that are very original. The major flaw is certain useless subplots that slow the already-not- fast pace down, especially in the 1st act. But that doesn't hurt much, as the later scenes' intensity makes up for it. 8.5/10",neutral,5,tt0172495
"The Fast and the Furious Every week, trucks containing valuable electronic equipment are hijacked by the expert drivers of super-fast, unmarked cars. In their investigation, the FBI and the Los Angeles police force begin to suspect participants in the vicious, illegal nighttime street-racing wars of committing the crimes. The almost cult-like following that this activity attracts is led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel, 'Pitch Black'), whose more sensible sister Mia (Jordana Brewster, 'The Faculty') is beginning to fall for Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker, 'She's All That'), a new face in the street-racing circuit. But, unbeknownst to Mia or Dominic and his entourage, Brian is an undercover cop who has been assigned to infiltrate their group and try to discover the culprit behind the thefts. But as Brian spends more and more time with the Torettos and their companions, he finds himself torn between his duty as a police officer, and his loyalty as a friend. Aside from the fact that 'The Fast and the Furious' is based on a Vibe magazine article about street-racing written by Ken Li, the script isn't anything special, and seems more heavily inspired by the mediocre Jerry Bruckheimer-produced 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' remake from last year, as well as a 1999 Hong Kong action film, 'The Legend of Speed'. I can forgive the lack of brains presented here, but some actual characters would have been nice, as would capable actors to fill their shoes. Paul Walker does not convince in the lead role, and fails to truly express the emotional byproducts of his character's internal conflict of interests, while Vin Diesel is all too content to let his muscles do the talking. Michelle Rodriguez, as Diesel's moody love interest, is the bright spark within the tedium, but it seems as if she wandered onto the set while filming 'Girlfight' and was instantly hired on the spot. For a mainstream breakthrough, this gifted actress deserved better. The saving grace of 'The Fast and the Furious' are the highly charged racing sequences, but even those are punctured by Rob Cohen's berserk direction. The soundtrack is way off, the camera cramps too close to the action, and what's with all the CGI? ~ 4/10 ~",negative,4,tt0232500
Avengers Age of Ultron is in my opinion an underrated movie. It's not as good as the first but it's still very good. The film isn't as dark as the trailers made it look which was disappointing.

"When Fight Club first appeared it became an instant cult film - a ""modern classic"". Back then I gave it 9/10. Just watched it again after a 8-10 year gap and now I'm giving it 8/10. Fight Club hasn't aged that well, and for all the wrong reasons. In 1999, there weren't many films or series like this. 25 years later - there are. Fight Club doesn't stand out anymore. It's still a good film though. Edward Norton is excellent as the ordinary guy who, bit by bit, entirely loses it. Brad Pitt is Norton's wild side: alter-ego Tyler Durden. What follows is an inner journey, exploring sexuality, control (and deliberate lack of...), self-harm and rule-breaking. Who/what is Norton? Who/what is Tyler Durden? There are a very wide range of interpretations open in Fight Club. This film is more or less dark in virtually every respect! Bonham-Carter is good in a supporting role, and Meat Loaf gets a good cameo. Fight Club is a strange film - one that has almost too much going on. It's also about 20 minutes too long.

"The Dark Knight (2008) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows the rise of a new criminal in Gotham who is looking to prove just how evil Gotham is by crushing the people the city believes in; meanwhile, Bruce Wayne and the Batman are trying to make the vigilante no longer needed by empowering a new district attorney who stands for justice. These two paths, both with a desire to end The Batman, are bound to cross. This movie is directed by Christopher Nolan (Tenet) and stars Christian Bale (American Psycho), Gary Oldman (True Romance), Morgan Freeman (Se7en), Michael Cain (Jaws 3), Heath Ledger (Brokeback Mountain), Aaron Eckhart (The Core) and Maggie Gyllenhaal (Crazy Heart). This is the greatest comic book movie of all time. Heath Ledger steals the show delivering the greatest Joker performance ever witnessed and his ability to deliver the perfect mannerisms, lines and unpredictable behavior was brilliant from beginning to end. The idea of Batman teaming up to end himself was well written and the evolution of the District attorney was also well done. The action scenes were absolutely awesome. Starting the film with the bank robbery set the tone for the picture so well and the hospital scene at the end was excellent. There's so much to like about this movie.

"A gothic supernatural movie based on the novel 'The Turn of the screw' and I will say this is not a very committed adaptation, it's more like a skeletal story taken and made into a different movie just like Kubrick did with The Shining but then again comparing that movie with this will be a huge slap in the face for everyone involved in The Shining. My main problem with this film was how un-gothic it was. This movie takes place in the 80s, 90s or modern day, I am not sure. Discarding it's period setting should've and could've worked if they had just specified a time period. I was so damn confused and it's not like It Follows where not knowing just helps us. Another part I disliked was the scares. Again, did this movie want to be this atmospheric horror or just a jumpscare pop corn flick? Even the movie couldn't decide it. There's one solid scare and one moment of genuine creepiness but that's about it. Again, the gothic atmosphere is thoroughly underused. One thing I did like was the performance from Mackenzie Davis, going from annoyed to scared, she really does a good job. Finn Wolfhard is just there and he really tries to be this creepy kid but it doesn't work, he should go back to his 80s era wisecracking roles. No offense to the actor. The scene stealer here is definitely the little girl Brooklyn Prince who really shines through. The story is slow, and then fast and the slow. Let me elaborate. In the beginning, the story takes it time to settle which I was all for it. It was building up to something. But then by the middle we are just shown a couple of scene so fast, one after another, I thought I'd need a breather. And then the end happens... the ending was just unsatisfying and just plain confusing or even lazy. I caught this movie as a premiere and I heard the director say that she made it in such a way that she wanted the ending to be open to interpretation but I say give us something solid story wise for us to make our own interpretation. All this while we're seeing this story develop as a ghost story and then in the end you make it seem all intellectual or mental or whatever, it just won't work. I just didn't care enough to make my own interpretation. I think everyone should go and watch it and form their own opinion. Don't expect something grand or you'll be disappointed like me. I had such high hopes for this adaptation of one of my favorite book but I guess I'll have to wait for another adaptation to come into fruition. I will give this movie a four out of ten. 4/10. That 4 simply because of the little girl and that one scene involving a mannequin.",negative,4,tt7510346
"This is one superb movie, I didn't get to see it at the movies because I wasn't 18 at the time (damn Australia), so I read the book and was so impressed I preordered the DVD, this movie is terrific, people whine how the movie goes down hill when Tyler comes into the picture. I have no idea why people think this, he has the best view on life. Ed Norton gives us another terrific performance, he has always been my favorite actor. Fincher demonstrates once again what a terrific and innovative director he is, his last two movies The Game and Seven were superb (I still think Seven probably has the best ending to a movie). People always critisise this movie for its violence, if some people look a bit deeper and actually watch the movie properly then they will see that this is one hell of a movie. Easily my all time favorite movie. A definite 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523

"The movie was completely unrewarding. Some of the plot elements had potential to be interesting, and the concept of the movie was great. Unfortunately, after watching it, I came away completely unsatisfied, because there was nothing more to think about. Everything was portrayed on a 3rd grade level, and nothing was really left to the imagination. where is the dualism of good and evil? Where is the delicate line between vigilante and hero? This movie attempts to draw these lines and then clearly plant itself in the good/hero camp. Yawn. What's the point? I am surprised that this movie is doing so well on IMDb, and hope that people will wake up soon and realize this movie is just another boring action flick. Some say its an improvement from Batman and Robin, notably the worst of the Batman movies. But for what Batman Begins makes up for in plot complexity and special effects, it loses by insulting my intelligence and trying to make everything in the Batman world so black and white.",negative,1,tt0372784
"Went to see 'Grudge' today because I am a fan of the series and I've said to give this new one a chance. Bad decision. In spite of the Red Band trailer that offered us a good peek, the movie itself is a total mess. I understood the Nicolas Pesce's vision on this new project, but I feel that they did not manage to arrange things properly. The acting is awful - they do not manage to share their emotions to the public and it is easily remarkable how they do not feel involved in the story (especially William Sadler). The story has a lot of plot holes. Some events remain a question that will never get answered. The chronological order is also disorderly, jumping from the present to the past, from the past to another past, from the other past to the present and so on. I remember that the first remake also approached the same technique and was not well received, but it was simpler than this one. You will also encounter some boring dialogues and actions that lead to nowhere. Although it is R-rated, I can not say I felt it. There are some good jump scares that managed to freak people in the cinema, however the scenes were not brutal or disgusting. The images and the visual effects were nice, but not extraordinary. Some of the Grudge fans will notice some Easter Eggs (both from Ju-On and the first American remake) that were nice to be there, thus some scenes are a faithful copy approached with a different perspective. I will try to not spoil so much but I should warn you: Should you see the movie, do not expect a different ending from the first American remake. It is almost the same. I rated it 4/10 for the visual effects, jump scares and the courage to develop a new story included in the same Universe. I would have given more if only the story and the characters were emphasised.",negative,4,tt3612126

"I have to be honest- I walked into this movie with pretty low expectations to begin with. It is only on a rare occasion anymore that I actually buy a ticket for a movie with any hope that it might actually provide entertainment, which is a shame. This movie, however, just lowered the bar- by a LOT. Hands down one of the worst movies that I've ever seen- and that's saying something. It is just a gaggle of actors working on an acid-trip of a script. Every bit of comedy is based on shock value, which wears thin on your patience very early on. It's gross, lewd, and utterly lacking of any wit or connection with the audience. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this to anyone- as I nearly went up to the box office and demanded a refund. It isn't even that I'm a prude or hate gross-out humor, I'm 18 for crying out loud- I just have the ability to recognize when someone put actual effort and thought into making a movie funny and when Hollywood is laughing AT US, instead of vice versa.

"The opening shot of this film is a back tracking shot that first appears to be traveling through some surreal landscape. However, rather quickly you see that it going over someone's skin, meaning it must have been in their body, and not just any part of the body, but the head. The shot starts in someones brain and then moves out of it, which I suppose is analogous to an idea being born and released into the world. That's precisely where the main plot of ""Fight Club"" starts. Two guys, fed up with the consumer culture just decide to ""let go"" and release all the stress, by what seems to be, beating the crap out of one another. However, their idea goes quite far beyond an excuse for violence and macho showing off. It is easy to understand it that way, but, many violent movies are misunderstood. Mainly because people tend to look at the violence and recklessness portrayed and not at the fact that all that is incidental to what the film is trying to say. In fact, the film doesn't serve as an excuse to show violence, it warns us against it, much like ""A Clockwork Orange."" Violence is shown, in what can only be described as, uncomfortable detail. Men's faces are literally beaten to a pulp, others are thrown down stairs, and one especially discomforting scene has chemicals burning away someone's skin. If that wasn't enough, there are numerous acts of vandalism committed in every form you can imagine. Now the question is, how can such chaos be justified or condoned? The answer is that it can't. The Narrator and Tyler aren't good people, per se, but they aren't evil. A little mad yes, but certainly not evil. They also aren't just criminals, they are victims. Their bizarre course of action is the result that they feel they need to get back at society, not anyone person, hence all the anarchy they cause. Their terms and conditions for doing all this are highly questionable and difficult to condone, but that's the point. ""Fight Club"" isn't a movie that shows problems and brings answers to the table. It's a movie that shows problems and presents ideas. Once again, this is similar to ""A Clockwork Orange"" in which the hero (or anti-hero) is given questionable treatment for his out right wrong actions and behavior. ""Fight Club"" blurs that line of what is condonable and what is not a step further. Here nothing is out right wrong or obviously right. Everything makes enough sense that you accept it as the film progresses, yet it all seems like just a bit too much and the exaggeration is hard to pinpoint. It is just as hard to pinpoint as the ""right"" and ""wrong."" David Fincher previously demonstrated his ability to blur lines of reality and illusion with the masterful ""The Game"" and here his skills are in full display once again. Like ""The Game, ""Fight Club"" is hard to believe as real or that that something like it could actually happen, but the ideas it presents are important and more than worth examining multiple times. It is an often hilarious, often bizarre, but always thought provoking satire with a great direction from Fincher. The fact that the film was made with a big budget in Hollywood, is all the more interesting. --- 9/10 Rated R for strong violent content. Ages 16+",positive,9,tt0137523
"There comes a point where it becomes too much. The drug-taking, the needles, the sex work, the stealing from family members... all at the tender age of 14. 70's Berlin was apparently not a very healthy time to be a teenager, especially when your mother doesn't even take you to the hospital when she discovers you collapsed on the bathroom floor after an overdose. Instead, she calls your fellow junkie loser boyfriend so you can 'get clean' together... yeah, that goes about as well as you'd expect. In any case, Christiane F. Is an over two-hour long slog 'true life' autobiographical feature about the life of a young girl who fortunately manages to kick the habit before the bucket. Not a lot of very nice things happen to her throughout the course of the film though, until eventually the perpetual misery becomes kind of numbing to the senses. What is an overall well-acted and authentic piece ends up as kind of monotonous in it's constant bleakness, and even a brief cameo from the Thin White Duke himself David Bowie in concert fails to lift the spirits much. Finally then... an interesting watch about a point in history which hopefully will never be replicated, but the repetitiveness of the 'message' with nary a sliver of light in sight tends to blunt it's overall impact. Not too impressed with the sudden ending-by-text, either. Still, worth seeing at least once.

"I saw this film for the second time the other night just to see if I can understand and appreciate what all the hype is/was about. Well, I didn't understand it this time either. I'm not saying that Se7en is a bad film, because it is not.

However, great acting, great cinematography, great production design, haunting music, and a great script. But, somehow it seems as if the sum of these parts is *less* than the value of the individual part. That is strange -- and a shame. Should I blame the director? As for the great acting: Morgan Freeman must be mentioned, he's almost always brilliant. And -- naturally -- Kevin Spacey in his small but important role as John Doe.

"IMDb Top 250: 30 The Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers continues the epic story that began in Fellowship of the Ring. We meet new characters, develop others, and see epic battles. There is such a phenomenon in film called 'Middle film syndrome' or something of the sort. It means that in a trilogy, the middle film is the weakest because it isn't exposition like the first film, or conclusion like the third. The Two Towers is a perfect example of this concept. The awe of Fellowship isn't present, and the finish of Return of the King doesn't happen, leaving... the middle. I'm not trying to say Two Towers is a bad film. But compared to the other Lord of the Rings films, it is. They're AAA, Towers is AA. The characters introduced, like the King and nephew in Rohan, are thrown into the story without a reasonable introduction. The battle for Helm's Deep isn't that spectacular. Humour is misplaced. Even the films colour is wrong. Some of these factors can't really be fixed, because of the books, but some of them should've been dealt with. There are still some great parts of Two Towers. Gollum is nuts, batty and crazy. His presence helps Frodo and Sam's scenes, which don't actually go anywhere. The Dead Marshes are creepy. Ringwraiths return- on new mounts. And the tree battle, the only epic scene in the movie. Most of my problems with Two Towers are that the scale is diminished, no scenes other than the battle at Isengard leave the viewer in awe. The battle for Helm's Deep was also... not great. The sides weren't even close to being reasonable, making the result unbelievable. The colouring of the last battle made it seem very dark and bleak, but Gimli became a walking joke and Legolas rode a shield/surfboard. Clashing themes. The orcs didn't have anything special in that battle to make the battle interesting. In a series with groundbreaking battles, Two Towers came up short. The Two Towers is a good film, but a mediocre Lord of the Rings film. If for some reason you see it before the other two, the others are far better. Not much else I can say, you're either in it for all 3 or not in it. Fear not, Return of the King is the strongest, a worthy finish of your time. 8.3/10",negative,3,tt0167261
"The Godfather (1972) Number 1 - 1972 Number 1 - 1970s Top 5 - All Time An offer you can't refuse ... The Godfather is considered one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps the best.

Upon its release in 1972, many people knew that something special was expected - the result, one of, if not the greatest and superior film of all time. I won't sit here defending this colossal masterpiece, it needs no such thing. The Godfather is the definitive inside to the operations, bonds and thoughts of the Mafia. Only one other film manages to give us a breathtaking panorama of the Mafia and that is Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas'.

"Chuck Palahniuk creates thrilling, captivating works for the mind of his readers. He is the author of 14 novels, two of which have already been made into movies and three other novels being considered or already in production to be major motion pictures. The first of Palahniuk books to move to film was Fight Club. Fight Club is a gripping page-turner unable to be put down until you realize you've read through the entirety of it in one sitting. Luckily, the movie held true to the book and might've even done a better job telling the story of Tyler Durden. The twisting thriller keeps you suspended until it blows your mind. The actors in Fight Club carry the movie fantastically; Edward Norton as the narrator, Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden, and Helena Bonham Carter as Marla Singer. Norton narrates as a character in the movie that moves in a run down house with Tyler Durden and then shares the life of Tyler Durden with the viewers. Marla Singer, the antagonist works her way into their lives, driving them crazy. To unleash their building frustration and deal with their excess testosterone, Norton and Pitt create what they call ""Fight Club"". ""The first rule of Fight Club is do not talk about Fight Club."" The subtle hints in this film foreshadow beautifully. Small special effects and the ability to physically see the raise of an eyebrow or hear the narration while watching a fight scene actually happen add up to effectively blow your mind and make you question how you didn't see anything coming.

"Silence of the Lambs is highly acclaimed as one of the best films ever made into the thriller genre, and in fact deserves this title. There are plenty of films like these nowadays, so the formula may be a bit cliché in fact, but the film itself still unique in his own way. Hannibal Lecter is a very intelligent man and at same time a dangerous psychopath, so normally the actor that would eventually take the role should put effort in bringing exactly what Hopkins's acting did. In Lecter skin, he looks like a creepy but classy individual, and one could argue that this kind of thing is very hard to accomplish. I found him to be almost an untouchable and invincible character, and if you watch the film you'll understand. I am not entirely convinced by 'that' scene(those who watched the film know what i am talking about), despite being very impressive. I also liked Jodie Foster in the film. Her performance in this film is good, not one of the 'Greatest Ever' but very convincing. If the intention was to show a character that is slightly scared all the time so she did very well, because it was exactly my impression about her. There are some harsh dialogs and situations in this film that may engross and even left the viewer uncomfortable, but still surprisingly tame for a film that explores the subjects it did. It don't have that much accomplished in the artistic aspects, but the story-telling is very good. And even with a few poorly made scenes(Jodie Foster calling 'Dr Lecter?' numerous times in the phone), it still a fine interesting film. 8.5/10",neutral,5,tt0102926

"The movie feels a little outdated when seen in 2025. Some of the special effects, like the explosions weren't done too well. The soundtrack isn't good. At one point, they play hip-hop/rap. The plot seems a little unnecessarily convoluted at times, with some multiple villains. I was not keen on the Asian girl, and I think she and Statham have little chemistry in this film: the romance scene felt rushed and tacked on. But with all those flaws- the movie is above-average because of Statham. He is credible and cool as the lead here. The action scenes are also well-done; they get especially creative near the end. 6.0/10.",negative,0,tt0293662
"That's what I thought at when I first saw the previews of this film back in 1999.  At first, I didn't pay much attention to these previews and and completely ignored it when came out on tape.  I didn't really get a chance to watch it until my cousin bought the tape and I watched it then. It's about a guy who from what we know is simply referred to as The Narrator (played by Edward Norton.)  He's an insomniac(for those of you who don't what an insomniac is, it's someone who has trouble sleeping.)  So he come up with a cure, which is to attend group meetings.  Which almost immediately cures his insomnia.  That is however, until he meets Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) another ""faker"" whose just there for unexplained reasons.  So his insomnia starts up again. While attending one of his usual business trips, The Narrator meets up with a rather unusual fellow named Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt) who is also a very bad dresser.  The two quickly become friends and set up ""Fight Club.""  It's where men pummel each other to bloody pulps.  Soon however, it gets a little out hand and the it quickly becomes ""Project Mayhem"" which is basically a terrorist organization that quickly begins popping up cities across the country. I really liked Fight Club.  It's dark, violent, and very funny.  It also contains some of the funniest moments I've ever seen in a movie that isn't really a comedy. I should also say that some people may get the wrong idea about this movie and might set up their own fight clubs. Anyway, Fight Club is a great movie full of violence, darkness, and some very funny moments. 10/10",positive,10,tt0137523
"One of the most wonderful things about the art of filmmaking is that it is incredibly good at getting an emotional response from the people that consume it. Now that was a really pretentious way of saying that films are great because they can make use feel happy, sad, scared, etc. I know for me personally that a lot of my favorite films are the ones that are able to make me cry. And I think that we can all agree that it is truly a wonderful thing when a film is made with such devotion and passion that it is able to make its audience shed tears over fictional characters and events. Unfortunately filmmakers know that audiences love when a film makes them cry, and some filmmakers will try and take advantage of that fact. They will make films that are filled with overdone clichés and over dramatized acting/dialogue in hopes of making the audience cry, because if you can get someone to cry at your film it's very unlikely that they will forget it, and they will probably like it. This is exactly the sort of film the Intouchables is, a cheap, insincere, artificial cluster of scenes that will do whatever is necessary to make the audience get emotional. These cheap films that target and exploit sensitive topics just so they can receive acclaim and attention, are in my opinion some of the worst films out there. They represent all of the worst aspects in filmmaking, and deserve to be called out for what they are, and they are detestable piles of complete s***. I'm entering my third paragraph and I haven't even mentioned the acting, plot, cinematography or really any of the actual specifics of the film yet, and that's because regardless of whether you've seen it or not you can already predict everything that happens in the entire film. The plot is so structured and formulaic that it feels like it was copied and pasted from a text-book. The cinematography is at best dull, and at other times so bad I actually can not believe it was in a film with a 9.5 million euro budget. (which comes out to roughly 10.8 million dollars.) All of the actors give exactly what you'd expect from a movie like The Intouchables, and honestly I can't even remember a thing about any of there performances. Which is a compliment for a movie like The Intouchables. The Intouchables received mixed reviews from critics, and was nominated for best foreign language films by the Golden Globes. Even though critics were split on the films quality, general audiences loved it. At the time of writing this review it is the 38th highest rated movie on IMDb, coming ahead of films like Apocalypse Now, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Seventh Seal, Ikiru, Vertigo, and even Citizen Kane. And I won't lie this upsets me, at least more than it should. The idea of a film as terrible as The Intouchables coming ahead films like the ones previously mentioned, (not to mention the dozens of other better ones in the top 250, and hundreds out of it.) just really destroys my faith in the film industry. I can not recommend that anyone watch this film ever. But even though I've been basically calling this film an indefensible offense on cinema. There are things out there that are much worse than it, so I won't give it the lowest rating possible. 2.1/10",negative,1,tt1675434
"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie about a hotshot banker named Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) who is convicted of murdering his wife and is imprisoned in Shawshank Prison. He remains hopeful and makes friends especially with a blackmarketeer named ""Red""( Morgan Freeman). I really don't see how this movie could possibly be the #2 film of all time, the movie is nothing groundbreakingly amazing, it is pretty poorly directed, the plot is thinner than air,there are no risks taken,and there is no thought provoked through watching the film that it only needs to one viewing to get the whole movie, in fact you wouldn't even need to watch the film to even understand how the movie is going end. The title already gives away the whole ""big"" finale of the movie. I don't see how anyone could possibly compare THIS to actually great movies like EVERYTHING that is below is on the Top 25. And the simple thought of this winning Best Picture back in '94, HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!, it would have given me somethingh to laugh at for the rest of my life, I still can't possibly see how the Academy could have even nominated this as the Best Picture of 1994. Anyway the only thing that saves the film of Morgan Freeman and it is only thing that even got me to see this film in the first place but it still can't stop me from giving this a poor grade. 2/10",negative,2,tt0111161
"This is the film that boosted M. Night Shyamalan career in the movie making business. When this movie came out it was a direct hit and brought something new to the horror genre. It was creepy, thrilling, suspenseful and yet still had that heartfelt elements. What I liked about this movie is how it didn't really on gore or jump scares to get the audiences attention. But because it brought that clever detailed build up that a lot of the horror movies now a days are missing out on. As a matter of fact this is a film that the whole family can watch without really offending anyone...Much. But it's still a really good film. The two main leads were the perfect match for this film. Bruce Willis's role as Dr. Malcolm Crowe was perfect. As a matter of fact I heard that Dr. Malcolm Crowe actually wrote the role for Bruce Willis. And Haley Joel Osment was amazing as an actor when he was little. Overall this is a great horror filmmaking and was a clever idea when it came out. 8.6/10",neutral,6,tt0167404
"Images of a routine baptism juxtaposed with those of mafia rival executions. To me, that's why ""The Godfather""is so fascinating. With these people, such bloody acts are strictly business, impersonal. Great characters and scenes emerge from this conceit, but that's really what it's all about. I don't think you can look at this movie without considering its lasting impact; the famous lines, set pieces and those dreaded oranges. It's all seeped into pop culture, and for good reason. It's just that damn good. Even if you're repulsed by Cosa Nostra goings-on, you still get drawn in. This is an epic in every sense of the word. 9/10",positive,9,tt0068646
"I agree that the latest movies from the Star Wars franchise were by far the worst in the whole series. I found TFA terrible and TLJ didn't convince me either. However, Rogue One was surprisingly good and I also liked Solo. I really don't understand the hate and all the 1/10 reviews. Solo is what it already says in the title: A Star Wars story. And thats how you should see it.",negative,1,tt3778644
I hated this movie more than I can begin to explain. I hated all the worse because each scene was wonderful but the package was a brown paper bag of flaming (you-know-what) left on my door step. Jackson didn't understand that this is a book about fraternal love. The love of the ents for Merry and Pippen and the love of Faramir for Frodo. The love of Gimli for Legolas. He tried to make it about Arwen and Aragorn because he seems to think that we can't see men love each other and not be gay. He really beat the horse to hamberger. Most of all he ended both of the stories in the middle. He added a hour and a half of garbage in the middle and left off all the meat at the end. All in all I give this moive a 4/10. If he hadn't changed Faramir's character and had spent 1/2 hrs less on the faked love scenes and 1/2 more on the Ents it would have gotten a 8 or a 9. This movie suffers the unforgivable sin of missed potential.,negative,4,tt0167261
"Moving forward from A New Hope, I now arrived at the most beloved Star Wars film to ever exist (most likely to ever will) - The Empire Strikes Back. I thought that the previous movie was pretty nice, but apparently I should've had liked it more because I got quite a bit of noises of disagreement from friends, so yeah. With hopes to like this one more, I pressed the play button and watched it. Let's dive into it, then. The Empire Strikes Back starts at a low point for the rebellion - now they're the ones hiding, being hunted by the empire, and despite having a magnificent victory against the death star recently, they, and especially young Luke Skywalker, still face more danger than they ever had before. Will Luke manage to shake off his pride and become a true Jedi, or will he succumb to the euphoria of his previous victories and fail everyone he cares about? I'd say that one major change from A New Hope to Empire is the main focus - in the previous movie I felt like the focus was on the worldbuilding (which makes sense, considering the fact that it was the start of a big franchise), and now the story feels much more character - driven. It's not like suddenly we're at a best-psychological-thriller-of-all-time levels, but I just feel like there's more focus on personality and flaws - especially with Luke and Han - which I like quite a bit. Also, Yoda is such a fun character here, both as an indicator to show us Luke's personality, and just as himself, too. He's really fun all around. One more thing that's an improvement over the previous film, I'd say, is the cinematography. Just the compositions of each shot, the darker color grading, the more mature aesthetic. I like that, and I'd also say with that that the action scenes got so much better here, pulling you into the movie more, with more engaging choreography and more slowburn moments. The pacing, which was one of my main issues with A New Hope, is much better here, more tight and consistent. Throughout the entire film, or almost the entirety of it, there's a good balance of drama and comedy, and I never felt straight-up bored, with each scene having just enough clever script and interesting scenarios to keep me interested. So yeah, definitely an improvement on that front. The John Williams score is still great, of course, and here he adds the brooding, dark and epic Imperial March - definitely deserves to be considered as iconic as it is, and a fine addition to an already great score. Just like with the previous film, though, things here don't have impact on me as much as they do on other people. Yeah, it's an improvement on all fronts, but still not enough to blow my socks off, to make me fall in love with the franchise, to truly win me over. Sorry, y'all. Also, the Leia and Han thing that's going on in this movie has some good moments, but it has some moments that felt a little too cliché for me, or a little too forced. Either way, yeah, I think you get the gist of it - I think this is an improvement, but still far from the masterpiece I was told it is. Sorry to disappoint you, folks, but I have to conclude it that way: The Empire Strikes Back is a big improvement over the previous film, but still didn't amaze me. It's good, more mature, I like the way it focuses on character arcs more, and it's more well-made overall, but it's still far from a masterpiece. Feeling a 7.2/10 on this one.",negative,2,tt0080684
"Actually, I have little to add to the majority of comments listed here, but since I just saw this movie the other night, and it really impressed me, I thought I might chime in: The notion with which I entered the cinema was, ""How gripping may a movie be if the end is given away in the beginning?"", and the answer turned out to be- pretty much. I agree, this is probably not #9 of all movies ever made. It's one more flick in the line of the others doubting our identity (like _Matrix_ or _Truman Show_), which seems to be the question of the new millenium. The acting is average, and the characters don't get too much depth, but I suspect this is a consequence of the way the story is told. But the story is captivating, and it's narrated in an amazing way. The unfolding is very clever, and I found myself fully concentrating on the plot, all the time. (Of course, my attempts to be _ahead_ of the story were moot in a picture which is told _backwards_.) As opposed to _Matrix_, which seemed to me to be an insult to my intelligence, this one was a challenge to it. I had expected a lot of the audience to give up halfway through and start to chatter and stuff, but everyone seemingly stayed focussed till the end (I'd take this as a compliment to the film team)- and what an end it was! I went out of the cinema fairly disturbed... Bottom line: Very nice idea, cleverly executed, always worth the admission to the cinema, or a tape's rent. But since the idea is not really _deep_, and since the way the story's told limits the story somewhat, it's not an alltime great. 8.5/10 (P.S.: Some people questioned why Leonard would know where to find his photos and stuff all the time- he repeatedly pointed out in the picture that he has conditioned himself to do so, that he got into the 'habit' of looking for them, a feat he still could manage, as opposed to Sam.)",neutral,5,tt0209144
"After Spielberg's introduction of humor to serious thriller with Jaws in 1974, his derivatives quickly changed cinema forever. Distilling his easy and life-like approach towards storytelling to the technique now known as 'comic relief' violent, serious or simply unappealing movies could now be made digestible for a broader audience by inserting random bits of comedy after stressful scenes. One of the big advantages of this method was also that it seemed to work even without putting much thought into it. You don't need a genius to do it. A stupid oneliner here, some odd physical comedy there and you can get even the most sensitive viewer trough a movie that can still be marketed towards an action oriented audience. What this has resulted in of course was, that making high- budget movies without elements of comedy now became a bad business decision and it became more and more rare that you could sit trough a piece of high caliber cinema without having to endure idiotic jokes and tasteless characters, often ruining crucial parts of an otherwise promising flick. One can not go about writing about this without mentioning infamous entities like the Jar-Jar Bings character from Star Wars: Episode One, Rob Schneider in Judge Dredd or Michael Bay's over the top ideas, often crossbreeding vicious melodrama with borderline cases of slapstick. Cinema is about what the audience wants and the audiences kept supporting this so comic relief kept ruining cinema for the last few decades. But you can only go so far (though this was somewhat more then far) and at some point stuff had to change. Sequels repeatedly promising a 'darker' more 'character centered' tone while dishing out the same topsy-turvy bullsh*t again and again kept loosing credibility and someone finally had to deliver. One year after Spider-man 3 and it's infamous emo-Peter-fever-dance-scene Nolan Presented the first 'serious' blockbuster for nearly a decade and brought about a revolution in mainstream cinema. Sounds cool? Just give me a few more minutes. The concept of Nolan's Batman is to switch bat-nipples to army gadgets, pull back on stupid comedy, give the main character something that can be called a background story, motivation, introduce a 'philosophical' aspect and basically place Batman into the real world as compared to la-la-lala-land where Sam Raimy's Spider-man lives together with Michael Bay on the back of a purple dinosaur. And all of this is really cool but wait a second, what about the box office? Wouldn't that mean that people need to THINK to grasp all this? How would this complex approach not frustrate the average moviegoer? How would Bruce Wayne's inability to express love, the Joker's hedonistic psychopathy not startle young mothers who go to the movies for fun and delight and like to enjoy movies together with the whole family? Nolan's got the key. Movies can be serious. They just has to be dumb as sh*t. It was a misunderstanding all along and Nolan (accidentally?)figured it out. It's not about the stress (in fact people love stress, isn't this the whole point of drama?). It's about the intellectual challenge. People want smart movies and they want serious movies, but not smart and serious like smart and serious. Smart and serious compared to their own abilities. That means on the average the intellectual abilities of what used to be a 13 year old way back when. So present all the deepness, complicatedness, motivations and this on the lowest, dumbest, most childish level that is possible so every idiot can understand and then put trillions of dollars into making it look like something big and then start viscerally overstimulating the viewers by having a severe score blare all the f*cking time and the tons and tons of dumb, shallow bullsh*t will sound like Dostojewsky because there was the really heavy music and they said it with this deep voice and they were sitting in this incredibly expensive setting, it has to be profound. Hell, they might even feel a bit profound themselves now, after all there is profound written all over this movie and it's dark, serious looking posters and you have to be a profound guy to enjoy a profound movie. They won't care, that it's pretentious, that it's shallow and infantile, they don't even know what those words mean. So this movie is on kindergarten level. It's not that there is nothing good about it, some of it is high quality stuff but it's a stupid, childish, shallow, phoney melodrama, it's overly long, extremely self- important and the production value is exactly the trick that makes it to be taken serious and therefore so harmful. It works because audiences are stupid and fall for everything flashy and loud and expensive looking, cause they are mainly teenagers and mainly Americans and because people love marketing and movies are only about marketing now. But the problem is not that Nolan made a phoney movie, it's that he brought about a new revolution in mainstream cinema, as now it is the bad business decision not to have low-level, pseudo-philosophical bullsh*t in high-budget movies and flicks like X- Men: First Class, the god awful Spider-Man reboot, Prometheus and many others already adopted his mind bogglingly boring, anti-intellectual approach centered around infantile conversation and now make more money then ever. Nolan ruined mainstream sci-fi and superhero movies at least for the next decade and the thing in which his misdeed is truly severe as compared to Spielberg's case above mentioned is, that he has shown people how to do the tasteless version right away, rather then just having invented something cool which the capitalist world then abused for it's own merit. He did the sh*tty thing right away, god forbid those studios have to figure it out for themselves. Thank you Mr. Nolan. 4/10",negative,4,tt0468569
